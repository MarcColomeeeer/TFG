        "summary": "  The assumption of real-number arithmetic, which is at the basis of\nconventional geometric algorithms, has been seriously challenged in recent\nyears, since digital computers do not exhibit such capability.\n  A geometric predicate usually consists of evaluating the sign of some\nalgebraic expression. In most cases, rounded computations yield a reliable\nresult, but sometimes rounded arithmetic introduces errors which may invalidate\nthe algorithms. The rounded arithmetic may produce an incorrect result only if\nthe exact absolute value of the algebraic expression is smaller than some\n(small) varepsilon, which represents the largest error that may arise in the\nevaluation of the expression. The threshold varepsilon depends on the structure\nof the expression and on the adopted computer arithmetic, assuming that the\ninput operands are error-free.\n  A pair (arithmetic engine,threshold) is an \"arithmetic filter\". In this paper\nwe develop a general technique for assessing the efficacy of an arithmetic\nfilter. The analysis consists of evaluating both the threshold and the\nprobability of failure of the filter.\n  To exemplify the approach, under the assumption that the input points be\nchosen randomly in a unit ball or unit cube with uniform density, we analyze\nthe two important predicates \"which-side\" and \"insphere\". We show that the\nprobability that the absolute values of the corresponding determinants be no\nlarger than some positive value V, with emphasis on small V, is Theta(V) for\nthe which-side predicate, while for the insphere predicate it is Theta(V^(2/3))\nin dimension 1, O(sqrt(V)) in dimension 2, and O(sqrt(V) ln(1/V)) in higher\ndimensions. Constants are small, and are given in the paper.\n",

We show\nthat such a set of independent points can be constructed efficiently in\nparallel and that the number of iterations needed is $O(\\log^2(L/s))$, where\n$L$ is the diameter of the domain, and $s$ is the smallest edge in the output\nmesh. In addition, we show that the insertion of each independent set of points\ncan be realized sequentially by Ruppert's method in two dimensions and\nShewchuk's in three dimensions. Therefore, our parallel Delaunay refinement\nmethods provide the same element quality and mesh size guarantees as the\nsequential algorithms in both two and three dimensions. For quasi-uniform\nmeshes, such as those produced by Chew's method, we show that the number of\niterations can be reduced to $O(\\log(L/s))$. To the best of our knowledge,\nthese are the first provably polylog$(L/s)$ parallel time Delaunay meshing\nalgorithms that generate well-shaped meshes of size optimal to within a\nconstant.\n",

When comparing measured data to data drawn from a\nbaseline distribution, merely, finding clusters in the measured data may not\nactually represent true anomalies. These clusters may likely be the clusters of\nthe baseline distribution. Hence, a discrepancy function is often used to\nexamine how different measured data is to baseline data within a region. An\nanomalous region is thus defined to be one with high discrepancy.\n  In this paper, we present algorithms for maximizing statistical discrepancy\nfunctions over the space of axis-parallel rectangles. We give provable\napproximation guarantees, both additive and relative, and our methods apply to\nany convex discrepancy function. Our algorithms work by connecting statistical\ndiscrepancy to combinatorial discrepancy; roughly speaking, we show that in\norder to maximize a convex discrepancy function over a class of shapes, one\nneeds only maximize a linear discrepancy function over the same set of shapes.\n  We derive general discrepancy functions for data generated from a one-\nparameter exponential family. This generalizes the widely-used Kulldorff scan\nstatistic for data from a Poisson distribution. We present an algorithm running\nin $O(\\smash[tb]{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} n^2 \\log^2 n})$ that computes the maximum\ndiscrepancy rectangle to within additive error $\\epsilon$, for the Kulldorff\nscan statistic.

The meshes described are those\nwhich, in the limit of an increasingly finer mesh (smaller cells), and away\nfrom irregular vertices, have ideally-shaped cells (squares or equilateral\ntriangles), and can therefore be completely described by two local properties:\nlocal cell size and local edge directions. The connection between the two\nproperties is derived by defining a Riemannian manifold whose geodesics trace\nthe edges of the mesh. A function $\\phi$, proportional to the logarithm of the\ncell size, is shown to obey the Poisson equation, with localized charges\ncorresponding to irregular vertices. The problem of finding a suitable manifold\nfor a given domain is thus shown to exactly reduce to an Inverse Poisson\nproblem on $\\phi$, of finding a distribution of localized charges adhering to\nthe conditions derived for boundary alignment.

We\nderive this criterion from our generalization of Van Heijenoort's (1952)\ntheorem on locally convex hypersurfaces in $R^n$ to spherical spaces. We also\ngive an easy-to-implement convexity testing algorithm, which is based on our\ncriterion. For $R^3$ the number of arithmetic operations used by the algorithm\nis at most linear in the number of vertices, while in general it is at most\nlinear in the number of incidences between the $(n-2)$-faces and $(n-3)$-faces.\nWhen the dimension $n$ is not fixed and only ring arithmetic is allowed, the\nalgorithm still remains polynomial. Our method works in more general situations\nthan the convexity verification algorithms developed by Mehlhorn et al. (1996)\nand Devillers et al. (1998) -- for example, our method does not require the\ninput surface to be orientable, nor it requires the input data to include\nnormal vectors to the facets that are oriented \"in a coherent way\". For $R^3$\nthe complexity of our algorithm is the same as that of previous algorithms; for\nhigher dimensions there seems to be no clear winner, but our approach is the\nonly one that easily handles inputs in which the facet normals are not known to\nbe coherently oriented or are not given at all.

We prove that these\n\\emph{Euclidean rhythms} have the mathematical property that their onset\npatterns are distributed as evenly as possible: they maximize the sum of the\nEuclidean distances between all pairs of onsets, viewing onsets as points on a\ncircle. Indeed, Euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this\nnotion of \\emph{evenness}. We also show that essentially all Euclidean rhythms\nare \\emph{deep}: each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique\nmultiplicity, and these multiplicies form an interval $1,2,...,k-1$. Finally,\nwe characterize all deep rhythms, showing that they form a subclass of\ngenerated rhythms, which in turn proves a useful property called shelling. All\nof our results for musical rhythms apply equally well to musical scales.

Bregman divergences\ninclude not only the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance but also various\ndivergence measures based on entropic functions. Accordingly, Bregman Voronoi\ndiagrams allow to define information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical\nparametric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions. We define\nseveral types of Bregman diagrams, establish correspondences between those\ndiagrams (using the Legendre transformation), and show how to compute them\nefficiently. We also introduce extensions of these diagrams, e.g. k-order and\nk-bag Bregman Voronoi diagrams, and introduce Bregman triangulations of a set\nof points and their connexion with Bregman Voronoi diagrams. We show that these\ntriangulations capture many of the properties of the celebrated Delaunay\ntriangulation.

Our algorithm is the first spacetime meshing algorithm\nsuitable for efficient solution of nonlinear phenomena in anisotropic media\nusing novel discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods for implicit\nsolutions directly in spacetime. Given a triangulated d-dimensional Euclidean\nspace domain M (a simplicial complex) and initial conditions of the underlying\nhyperbolic spacetime PDE, we construct an unstructured simplicial mesh of the\n(d+1)-dimensional spacetime domain M x [0,infinity). Our algorithm uses a\nnear-optimal number of spacetime elements, each with bounded temporal aspect\nratio for any finite prefix M x [0,T] of spacetime. Our algorithm is an\nadvancing front procedure that constructs the spacetime mesh incrementally, an\nextension of the Tent Pitcher algorithm of Ungor and Sheffer (2000).\n  In 2DxTime, our algorithm simultaneously adapts the size and shape of\nspacetime tetrahedra to a spacetime error indicator. We are able to incorporate\nmore general front modification operations, such as edge flips and limited mesh\nsmoothing. Our algorithm represents recent progress towards a meshing algorithm\nin 2DxTime to track moving domain boundaries and other singular surfaces such\nas shock fronts.\n",

When the PDEs are nonlinear, the\nspeed of propagation of the phenomena, called the wavespeed, at any point in\nthe spacetime domain is computed as part of the solution. We give an advancing\nfront algorithm to construct a simplicial mesh of the spacetime domain suitable\nfor DG solutions. Given a simplicial mesh of a bounded linear or planar space\ndomain M, we incrementally construct a mesh of the spacetime domain M x\n[0,infinity) such that the solution can be computed in constant time per\nelement. We add a patch of spacetime elements to the mesh at every step. The\nboundary of every patch is causal which means that the elements in the patch\ncan be solved immediately and that the patches in the mesh are partially\nordered by dependence. The elements in a single patch are coupled because they\nshare implicit faces; however, the number of elements in each patch is bounded.\nThe main contribution of this paper is sufficient constraints on the progress\nin time made by the algorithm at each step which guarantee that a new patch\nwith causal boundary can be added to the mesh at every step even when the\nwavespeed is increasing discontinuously. Our algorithm adapts to the local\ngradation of the space mesh as well as the wavespeed that most constrains\nprogress at each step.

In addition, we describe a more complex algorithm for straight\nskeletons of voxel-based polyhedra, which takes time proportional to the area\nof the surfaces of the straight skeleton rather than the volume of the\npolyhedron. We also consider more general polyhedra with axis-parallel edges\nand faces, and show that any n-vertex polyhedron of this type has a straight\nskeleton with O(n^2) features. We provide algorithms for constructing the\nstraight skeleton, with running time O(min(n^2 log n, k log^{O(1)} n)) where k\nis the output complexity. Next, we discuss the straight skeleton of a general\nnonconvex polyhedron. We show that it has an ambiguity issue, and suggest a\nconsistent method to resolve it.

Rectangular layouts appear in various\napplications: as rectangular cartograms in cartography, as floorplans in\nbuilding architecture and VLSI design, and as graph drawings. Often areas are\nassociated with the rectangles of a rectangular layout and it might hence be\ndesirable if one rectangular layout can represent several area assignments. A\nlayout is area-universal if any assignment of areas to rectangles can be\nrealized by a combinatorially equivalent rectangular layout. We identify a\nsimple necessary and sufficient condition for a rectangular layout to be\narea-universal: a rectangular layout is area-universal if and only if it is\none-sided. More generally, given any rectangular layout L and any assignment of\nareas to its regions, we show that there can be at most one layout (up to\nhorizontal and vertical scaling) which is combinatorially equivalent to L and\nachieves a given area assignment. We also investigate similar questions for\nperimeter assignments. The adjacency requirements for the rectangles of a\nrectangular layout can be specified in various ways, most commonly via the dual\ngraph of the layout.

We combine two different approaches to find regular\npolygons, depending on their number of edges. Our result depends on the\nparameter alpha, which has been used to bound the maximum number of isosceles\ntriangles that can be formed by n points. This bound has been expressed as\nO(n^{2+2alpha+epsilon}), and the current best value for alpha is ~0.068.\n  Our algorithm finds polygons with O(n^alpha) edges by sweeping a line through\nthe set of points, while larger polygons are found by random sampling. We can\nfind all regular polygons with high probability in O(n^{2+alpha+epsilon})\nexpected time for every positive epsilon. This compares well to the\nO(n^{2+2alpha+epsilon}) deterministic algorithm of Brass.\n",

This quantity\nmeasures the resolution needed to display a figure or the tool size needed to\nmill the figure. The spread is the ratio of the diameter to the minimum feature\nsize. While many algorithms (particularly in meshing) depend on the spread of\nthe input, none explicitly consider finding a mesh whose spread is similar to\nthe input. When a polygon is partitioned into smaller regions, such as\ntriangles or quadrangles, the degradation is the ratio of original to final\nspread (the final spread is always greater).\n  Here we present an algorithm to quadrangulate a simple n-gon, while achieving\nconstant degradation. Note that although all faces have a quadrangular shape,\nthe number of edges bounding each face may be larger. This method uses Theta(n)\nSteiner points and produces Theta(n) quadrangles. In fact to obtain constant\ndegradation, Omega(n) Steiner points are required by any algorithm.\n  We also show that, for some polygons, a constant factor cannot be achieved by\nany triangulation, even with an unbounded number of Steiner points.

In this paper, we present the first algorithms that\ncompute the geodesic diameter of a given polygonal domain in worst-case time\nO(n^7.73) or O(n^7 (log n + h)). The main difficulty unlike the simple polygon\ncase relies on the following observation revealed in this paper: two interior\npoints can determine the geodesic diameter and in that case there exist at\nleast five distinct shortest paths between the two.\n",

If true, it would imply the lower bound $\\Omega(s/\\log s)$ on the\nnumber of distinct distances in the plane.\n",

Maxwell's condition states that the edges of a\ngraph $G=(V, E)$ are {\\em independent} in its $d$-dimensional generic rigidity\nmatroid only if $(a)$ the number of edges $|E|$ $\\le$ $d|V| - {d+1\\choose 2}$,\nand $(b)$ this holds for every induced subgraph with at least $d$ vertices. We\ncall such graphs {\\em Maxwell-independent} in $d$ dimensions. Laman's theorem\nshows that the converse holds for $d=2$ and thus every maximal\nMaxwell-independent set of $G$ has size equal to the rank of the 2-dimensional\ngeneric rigidity matroid. While this is false for $d=3$, we show that every\nmaximal, Maxwell-independent set of a graph $G$ has size at least the rank of\nthe 3-dimensional generic rigidity matroid of $G$. This answers a question\nposed by Tib\\'or Jord\\'an at the 2008 rigidity workshop at BIRS\n\\cite{bib:birs}.\n  Along the way, we construct subgraphs (1) that yield alternative formulae for\na rank upper bound for Maxwell-independent graphs and (2) that contain a\nmaximal (true) independent set. We extend this bound to special classes of\nnon-Maxwell-independent graphs. One further consequence is a simpler proof of\ncorrectness for existing algorithms that give rank bounds.\n",

In this paper sharp inequalities between core-radii for general\ncontainment under homothetics are obtained. Moreover, the presented\ninequalities are used to derive sharp upper bounds on the size of core-sets for\ncontainment under homothetics. In the MEB case, this yields a tight (dimension\nindependent) bound for the size of such core-sets. In the general case, we show\nthat there are core-sets of size linear in the dimension and that this bound\nstays sharp even if the container is required to be symmetric.\n",

This problem is NP-complete and APX-hard. The first\napproximation algorithm (Ghosh, 1987) involves decomposing P into O(n^4) cells\nthat are equivalence classes for visibility from the vertices of P. This\ndiscretized problem can then be treated as an instance of set cover and solved\nin O(n^5) time with a greedy O(log n)-approximation algorithm. Ghosh (2010)\nrecently revisited the algorithm, noting that minimum visibility decompositions\nfor simple polygons (Bose et al., 2000) have only O(n^3) cells, improving the\nrunning time of the algorithm to O(n^4) for simple polygons.\n  In this paper we show that, since minimum visibility decompositions for\nsimple polygons have only O(n^2) cells of minimal visibility (Bose et al.,\n2000), the running time of the algorithm can be further improved to O(n^3).\nThis result was obtained independently by Jang and Kwon (2011). We extend the\nresult of Bose et al. to polygons with holes, showing that a minimum visibility\ndecomposition of a polygon with h holes has only O((h+1)n^3) cells and only\nO((h+1)^2 n^2) cells of minimal visibility. We exploit this result to obtain a\nfaster algorithm for vertex guarding polygons with holes. We then show that, in\nthe same time complexity, we can attain approximation factors of O(log\nlog(opt)) for simple polygons and O((1+\\log((h+1))) log(opt)) for polygons with\nholes.\n",

The problem\nof sweeping points by orthogonal sweeps was first studied in [2]. Here we\nconsider the following \\emph{slanted} variant of sweeping recently introduced\nin [1]: In a single sweep, the sweep-line is placed at a start position\nsomewhere in the plane, then moved continuously according to a sweep vector\n$\\vec v$ (not necessarily orthogonal to the sweep-line) to another parallel end\nposition, and then lifted from the plane. The cost of a sequence of sweeps is\nthe sum of the lengths of the sweep vectors. The (optimal) sweeping cost of a\nregion is the infimum of the costs over all finite sweeping sequences for that\nregion. An optimal sweeping sequence for a region is one with a minimum total\ncost, if it exists. Another parameter of interest is the number of sweeps.\n  We show that there exist convex regions for which the optimal sweeping cost\ncannot be attained by two sweeps. This disproves a conjecture of Bousany,\nKarker, O'Rourke, and Sparaco stating that two sweeps (with vectors along the\ntwo adjacent sides of a minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram) always\nsuffice [1]. Moreover, we conjecture that for some convex regions, no finite\nsweeping sequence is optimal. On the other hand, we show that both the 2-sweep\nalgorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing rectangle and the 2-sweep\nalgorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram achieve a $4/\\pi\n\\approx 1.27$ approximation in this sweeping model.\n",

The analysis applies almost verbatim\nwhen L is a set of line-segments, and yields similar asymptotic bounds. We\npresent several extensions, including a trade-off between space and query time\nand an output-sensitive algorithm.

In this paper, we investigate the hardness of these\nproblems with respect to the dimension d of the underlying space.\n  All these problems are solvable in time {n^O(d)}, but such a time dependency\nquickly becomes intractable for high-dimensional data. Thus it is interesting\nto ask whether the dependency on d can be moderated.\n  We answer this question negatively by proving that the canonical decision\nproblems are W[1]-hard with respect to the dimension. This is done via a\nparameterized reduction from the Clique problem. As the parameter stays linear\nin the input parameter, the results moreover imply that these problems require\n{n^\\Omega(d)} time, unless 3-Sat can be solved in {2^o(n)} time.\n  Further, we derive that testing whether a given set is an {\\epsilon}-net with\nrespect to half-spaces takes {n^\\Omega(d)} time under the same assumption.

Here the problem is extended to 3D polyhedra, with the\nguards now boundary segments who rotate half-planes of illumination. After\ncarefully detailing the 3D model, several results are established. The first is\na nearly direct extension of the planar one-way sweep strategy using what we\ncall exhaustive guards, a generalization that succeeds despite there being no\nwell-defined notion in 3D of planar \"clockwise rotation\". Next follow two\nresults: every polyhedron with r>0 reflex edges can be searched by at most r^2\nsuitably placed guards, whereas just r guards suffice if the polyhedron is\northogonal. (Minimizing the number of guards to search a given polyhedron is\neasily seen to be NP-hard.) Finally we show that deciding whether a given set\nof guards has a successful search schedule is strongly NP-hard, and that\ndeciding if a given target area is searchable at all is strongly PSPACE-hard,\neven for orthogonal polyhedra. A number of peripheral results are proved en\nroute to these central theorems, and several open problems remain for future\nwork.\n",

WRGs are representative of a a larger family of witness\nproximity graphs introduced in two previous papers. We study graph-theoretic\nproperties of WRGs. We prove that any WRG has at most two non-trivial connected\ncomponents. We bound the diameter of the non-trivial connected components of a\nWRG in both the one-component and two-component cases. In the latter case, we\nprove that a graph is representable as a WRG if and only if each component is a\nconnected co-interval graph, thereby providing a complete characterization of\nWRGs of this type. We also completely characterize trees drawable as WRGs. In\naddition, we prove that a WRG with no isolated vertices has domination number\nat most four. Moreover, we show that any combinatorial graph can be drawn as a\nWRG using a combination of positive and negative witnesses.

It is\nclear that the Cayley complexity only depends on the graph G and possibly the\nnon-edge f. Here we ask whether the Cayley complexity depends on the choice of\na base non-edge f. We answer this question in the negative, thereby showing\nthat low Cayley complexity is a property of the graph G (independent of the\nnon-edge f).\n  Then, we give a simple characterization of graphs with low Cayley complexity,\nleading to an efficient algorithmic characterization, i.e. an efficient\nalgorithm for recognizing such graphs.\n  Next, we show a surprising result that (graph) planarity is equivalent to low\nCayley complexity for a natural subclass of 1-dof triangle-decomposable graphs.\nWhile this is a finite forbidden minor graph characterization of low Cayley\ncomplexity, we provide counterexamples showing impossibility of such finite\nforbidden minor characterizations when the above subclass is enlarged.\n",

Multi-lateration is employed to localize the malicious target\nnode in 2D using four neighbor nodes. After localization of two consecutive\npositions, the target node is continuously localized and tracked by a\nparticular node using the modified real time Position Localization and Tracking\n(PL&T) algorithm by adaptive beam forming and mapping the energy contours of\ntracking zone into coverage radii distance.

An atlas is a\nlabeled partition of the assembly landscape into a topological roadmap of\nmaximal, contiguous, nearly-equipotential-energy conformational regions or\nmacrostates, together with their neighborhood relationships. The new\nmethodology decouples the roadmap generation from sampling and produces: (1) a\nquery-able atlas of local potential energy minima, their basin structure,\nenergy barriers, and neighboring basins; (2) paths between a specified pair of\nbasins; and (3) approximations of relative path lengths, basin volumes\n(configurational entropy), and path probabilities. Results demonstrating the\ncore algorithm's capabilities have been generated by a resource-light,\nopensource software implementation EASAL. EASAL atlases several hundred\nthousand macrostates in minutes on a standard laptop. Subsequent path and basin\ncomputations each take seconds. The core algorithm's correctness, time\ncomplexity, and efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs are formally guaranteed using\nmodern geometric constraint systems. The methodology further links geometric\nvariables of the input assembling units to a type of intuitive topological\nbar-code of the output atlas, which in turn determine stable assembled\nstructures and kinetics. This succinct input-output relationship facilitates\nreverse analysis, and control towards design. We use the novel convex Cayley\n(distance-based) parametrization that is unique to assembly, as opposed to\nfolding. Sampling microstates with macrostate-specific Cayley parameters avoids\ngradient-descent search used by all prevailing methods. This increases sampling\nefficiency, significantly reduces the number of repeated and discarded samples.\n",

The algorithm runs in $O(\\dfrac{mn\\log\\log n}{\\log n})$ time\nand uses $O(n+m)$ storage. Our approach uses the geometry of the problem in a\nsubtle way to encode legal positions of the frogs as states of a finite\nautomata.\n",

Chromatic clustering seeks to\npartition a set of colored points into groups (or clusters) so that no group\ncontains points with the same color and a certain objective function is\noptimized. In this paper, we consider two variants of the problem, chromatic\n$k$-means clustering (denoted as $k$-CMeans) and chromatic $k$-medians\nclustering (denoted as $k$-CMedians), and investigate their hardness and\napproximation solutions. For $k$-CMeans, we show that the additional coloring\nconstraint destroys several key properties (such as the locality property) used\nin existing $k$-means techniques (for ordinary points), and significantly\ncomplicates the problem. There is no FPTAS for the chromatic clustering\nproblem, even if $k=2$. To overcome the additional difficulty, we develop a\nstandalone result, called {\\em Simplex Lemma}, which enables us to efficiently\napproximate the mean point of an unknown point set through a fixed dimensional\nsimplex. A nice feature of the simplex is its independence with the\ndimensionality of the original space, and thus can be used for problems in very\nhigh dimensional space. With the simplex lemma, together with several random\nsampling techniques, we show that a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation of $k$-CMeans\ncan be achieved in near linear time through a sphere peeling algorithm. For\n$k$-CMedians, we show that a similar sphere peeling algorithm exists for\nachieving constant approximation solutions.\n",

Given a\nset of points $P$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space, projective clustering is to find a\nset $\\mathbb{F}$ of $k$ lower dimensional $j$-flats so that the average\ndistance (or squared distance) from points in $P$ to their closest flats is\nminimized. Existing approaches for this problem are mainly based on\nadaptive/volume sampling or core-sets techniques which suffer from several\nlimitations. In this paper, we present the first uniform random sampling based\napproach for this challenging problem and achieve linear time solutions for\nthree cases, general projective clustering, regular projective clustering, and\n$L_{\\tau}$ sense projective clustering. For the general projective clustering\nproblem, we show that for any given small numbers $0<\\gamma, \\epsilon <1$, our\napproach first removes $\\gamma|P|$ points as outliers and then determines $k$\n$j$-flats to cluster the remaining points into $k$ clusters with an objective\nvalue no more than $(1+\\epsilon)$ times of the optimal for all points. For\nregular projective clustering, we demonstrate that when the input points\nsatisfy some reasonable assumption on its input, our approach for the general\ncase can be extended to yield a PTAS for all points. For $L_{\\tau}$ sense\nprojective clustering, we show that our techniques for both the general and\nregular cases can be naturally extended to the $L_{\\tau}$ sense projective\nclustering problem for any $1 \\le \\tau < \\infty$. Our results are based on\nseveral novel techniques, such as slab partition, $\\Delta$-rotation, symmetric\nsampling, and recursive projection, and can be easily implemented for\napplications.\n",

Then there exists\na subset T of S that is not \"visually discernible\", that is, T is not equal to\nthe intersection of S with the visibility region vis(v) of any point v in P. In\nother words, the VC-dimension d of visibility regions in a simple polygon\ncannot exceed 14. Since Valtr proved in 1998 that d \\in [6,23] holds, no\nprogress has been made on this bound.

However, if we consider only computable curves of computable\nlengths, then all four versions of computable curves become equivalent. This\nshows that the definition of computable curves is robust, at least for those of\ncomputable lengths.

        "summary": "  This paper introduces a new way of generalizing Hilbert's two-dimensional\nspace-filling curve to arbitrary dimensions. The new curves, called harmonious\nHilbert curves, have the unique property that for any d' < d, the d-dimensional\ncurve is compatible with the d'-dimensional curve with respect to the order in\nwhich the curves visit the points of any d'-dimensional axis-parallel space\nthat contains the origin. Similar generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are\ndescribed for several variants of Peano's curve (the original Peano curve, the\ncoil curve, the half-coil curve, and the Meurthe curve). The d-dimensional\nharmonious Hilbert curves and the Meurthe curves have neutral orientation: as\ncompared to the curve as a whole, arbitrary pieces of the curve have each of d!\npossible rotations with equal probability. Thus one could say these curves are\n`statistically invariant' under rotation---unlike the Peano curves, the coil\ncurves, the half-coil curves, and the familiar generalization of Hilbert curves\nby Butz and Moore.\n  In addition, prompted by an application in the construction of R-trees, this\npaper shows how to construct a 2d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano\ncurve that traverses the points of a certain d-dimensional diagonally placed\nsubspace in the order of a given d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano\ncurve.\n  Pseudocode is provided for comparison operators based on the curves presented\nin this paper.\n",

Such range spaces are called\n\"well behaved\". Our bound is an improvement over the bound O(\\log{(1/p)/\\eps^2\np) introduced by Li etal. for the general case (where this bound has been shown\nto be tight in the worst case), when p << Epsilon. We also show that such small\nsize relative (p,Epsilon)-approximations can be constructed in expected\npolynomial time.\n  Our bound also has an interesting interpretation in the context of \"p-nets\":\nAs observed by Har-Peled and Sharir, p-nets are special cases of relative\n(p,Epsilon)-approximations. Specifically, when Epsilon is a constant smaller\nthan 1, their analysis implies that there are p-nets of size O(\\log{(1/p)}/p)\nthat are \\emph{also} relative approximations. In this context our construction\nsignificantly improves this bound for well-behaved range spaces. Despite the\nprogress in the theory of p-nets and the existence of improved bounds\ncorresponding to the cases that we study, these bounds do not necessarily\nguarantee a bounded relative error.\n  Lastly, we present several geometric scenarios of well-behaved range spaces,\nand show the resulting bound for each of these cases obtained as a consequence\nof our analysis.

The algorithm and its analysis are simpler than the\nexisting ones.\n  - An extension of our methods to find a C-oriented minimum-link path in a\ngeneral (not necessarily C-oriented) domain.\n  - A more efficient algorithm to compute a 2-approximate C-oriented\nminimum-link path.\n  - A notion of \"robust\" paths. We show how minimum-link C-oriented paths\napproximate the robust paths with unrestricted orientations to within an\nadditive error of 1.\n",

This paper first studies what this heurstics really\nrepresents in terms of reduction of points and demonstrates that the optimum\nselection is reached using an octogon as the remaining number of points is in\nO(sqrt(N)) rather than the usual O(N). Then it focuses on optimising the\noverall computational efficiency in a convex hull computation. Although the\nheuristics is usually used as a first step in computations one can obtain the\nconvex hull directly from the heuristics's basis. First a simple incremental\nimplementation is described, and if the number of characteristic points of the\nAkl-Toussaint heuristics p is taken as a parametre the convex hull is then\ncomputed in a O(N(p+h/p)) average complexity or O(Nh) asymptotic complexity.\nGiven the relative constant factor of 1/p however experimental results show\nthat this algorithm should be considered linear in average. Worst-case\ncomplexity is in O(N^2) and space complexity is O(h) but could be O(1) if the\nrequired output is the array of convex vertices's indexes. Then a remark on why\nthe basic incremental method should be preferred for average cases is made.\nFinally an optimal linear algorithm both in average and worst-case and using a\nminimal space complexity in O(sqrt(N)) in average (or O(1) if in-place\ncomputation is allowed) is presented.\n",

Euclidean shortest paths and minimum-link paths between $s$\nand $t$ inside $P$ have been well studied. Both these kinds of paths are simple\nand piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths in the context of\ndiffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a\nlight source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the\nturning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$. A\ndiffuse reflection path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of\nturning points amongst all diffuse reflection paths between $s$ and $t$. The\nminimum diffuse reflection path may not be simple. The problem of computing the\nminimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained\nopen.\n  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse\nreflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a\nnew kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection\npath where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the\nEuclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave\nexactly once. For computing a minimum constrained diffuse reflection path from\n$s$ to $t$, we present an $O(n(n+\\beta))$ time algorithm, where $\\beta =\\Theta\n(n^2)$ in the worst case. Here, $\\beta$ depends on the shape of the polygon. We\nalso establish some properties relating minimum constrained diffuse reflection\npaths and minimum diffuse reflection paths. Constrained diffuse reflection\npaths introduced in this paper provide new geometric insights into the hitherto\nunknown structures and shapes of optimal reflection paths.\n",

This diagram has direct applications in\nVLSI design. We consider so-called \"non-crossing\" clusters. The complexity of\nthe Hausdorff diagram of m such clusters is linear in the total number n of\npoints in the convex hulls of all clusters. We present randomized incremental\nconstructions for computing efficiently the diagram, improving considerably\nprevious results. Our best complexity algorithm runs in expected time O((n +\nm(log log(n))^2)log^2(n)) and worst-case space O(n). We also provide a more\npractical algorithm whose expected running time is O((n + m log(n))log^2(n))\nand expected space complexity is O(n). To achieve these bounds, we augment the\nrandomized incremental paradigm for the construction of Voronoi diagrams with\nthe ability to efficiently handle non-standard characteristics of generalized\nVoronoi diagrams, such as sites of non-constant complexity, sites that are not\nenclosed in their Voronoi regions, and empty Voronoi regions.\n",

        "summary": "  Most CAD or other spatial data models, in particular boundary representation\nmodels, are called \"topological\" and represent spatial data by a structured\ncollection of \"topological primitives\" like edges, vertices, faces, and\nvolumes. These then represent spatial objects in geo-information- (GIS) or CAD\nsystems or in building information models (BIM). Volume objects may then either\nbe represented by their 2D boundary or by a dedicated 3D-element, the \"solid\".\nThe latter may share common boundary elements with other solids, just as\n2D-polygon topologies in GIS share common boundary edges. Despite the frequent\nreference to \"topology\" in publications on spatial modelling the formal link\nbetween mathematical topology and these \"topological\" models is hardly\ndescribed in the literature. Such link, for example, cannot be established by\nthe often cited nine-intersections model which is too elementary for that\npurpose. Mathematically, the link between spatial data and the modelled \"real\nworld\" entities is established by a chain of \"continuous functions\" - a very\nimportant topological notion, yet often overlooked by spatial data modellers.\nThis article investigates how spatial data can actually be considered\ntopological spaces, how continuous functions between them are defined, and how\nCAD systems can make use of them. Having found examples of applications of\ncontinuity in CAD data models it turns out that of continuity has much\npractical relevance for CAD systems.\n",

Such a matching is monochromatic if every rectangle\ncontains points of the same color, and is bichromatic if every rectangle\ncontains points of different colors.

        "summary": "  Finding a maximum independent set (MIS) of a given fam- ily of axis-parallel\nrectangles is a basic problem in computational geom- etry and combinatorics.\nThis problem has attracted significant atten- tion since the sixties, when\nWegner conjectured that the corresponding duality gap, i.e., the maximum\npossible ratio between the maximum independent set and the minimum hitting set\n(MHS), is bounded by a universal constant. An interesting special case, that\nmay prove use- ful to tackling the general problem, is the\ndiagonal-intersecting case, in which the given family of rectangles is\nintersected by a diagonal. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6\napproximation algorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality\ngap is between 3/2 and 6. In this paper we improve upon these results. First we\nshow that MIS in diagonal-intersecting families is NP-complete, providing one\nsmallest subclass for which MIS is provably hard. Then, we derive an\n$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set when, in\naddition the rectangles intersect below the diagonal. This improves and extends\na classic result of Lubiw, and amounts to obtain a 2-approximation algo- rithm\nfor the maximum weight independent set of rectangles intersecting a diagonal.\nFinally, we prove that for diagonal-intersecting families the duality gap is\nbetween 2 and 4. The upper bound, which implies an approximation algorithm of\nthe same factor, follows from a simple com- binatorial argument, while the\nlower bound represents the best known lower bound on the duality gap, even in\nthe general case.\n",

However, the problem of tracking where particular edges go during the\nflipping process has not been addressed. We examine this question by attaching\nunique labels to the triangulation edges. We introduce the concept of the orbit\nof an edge $e$, which is the set of all edges reachable from $e$ via flips.\n  We establish the first upper and lower bounds on the diameter of the flip\ngraph in this setting. Specifically, we prove tight $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bounds\nfor edge-labelled triangulations of $n$-vertex convex polygons and\ncombinatorial triangulations, contrasting with the $\\Theta(n)$ bounds in their\nrespective unlabelled settings. The $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ lower bound for the\nconvex polygon setting might be of independent interest, as it generalizes\nlower bounds on certain sorting models. When simultaneous flips are allowed,\nthe upper bound for convex polygons decreases to $O(\\log^2 n)$, although we no\nlonger have a matching lower bound.\n  Moving beyond convex polygons, we show that edge-labelled triangulated\npolygons with a single reflex vertex can have a disconnected flip graph. This\nis in sharp contrast with the unlabelled case, where the flip graph is\nconnected for any triangulated polygon. For spiral polygons, we provide a\ncomplete characterization of the orbits. This allows us to decide connectivity\nof the flip graph of a spiral polygon in linear time. We also prove an upper\nbound of $O(n^2)$ on the diameter of each connected component, which is optimal\nin the worst case. We conclude with an example of a non-spiral polygon whose\nflip graph has diameter $\\Omega(n^3)$.\n",

Compression techniques dedicated to such meshes have emerged, which\nexploit the idea that the connectivity of a dense mesh does not deviate much\nfrom the connectivity that can be constructed automatically from the vertex\npositions (while possibly being guided by additional codes). The edge flip is\none of the tools that can encode the differences between two meshes, and it is\nimportant to control the length of a sequence of flips that transform one\ntriangulation into another. This paper provides a practical solution to this\nproblem. Indeed, the problem of determining a minimal sequence of edge flips\nbetween two triangulations is NP-complete for some types of triangulations\nincluding manifold triangulations of surfaces, so that it is necessary to\ndevelop heuristics. Moreover, it is sometimes difficult to establish a first\nsequence of flips between two meshes, and we advocate a solution based on the\nreduction of an existing sequence. The new approach we propose is founded on\nthe assignment of labels to identify the edges, with a property of label\ntransfer during a flip. This gives a meaning to the tracking of an edge in a\nsequence of flips and offers the exploitation of very simple combinatorial\nproperties. All the operations are performed directly on the sequence of labels\ndenoting the edges to be flipped, almost regardless of the underlying surface,\nsince only local temporary connectivity is involved.\n",

When shortcuts are allowed only in one\nnoise-containing curve, we give an even faster randomized algorithm that runs\nin $O((m+n)^{6/5+\\varepsilon})$ expected time, for any $\\varepsilon>0$.\n  Our techniques are novel and may find further applications.

We combine this procedure\nwith additional ideas to search, with a small overhead, for the optimal\none-sided Fr\\'echet distance with shortcuts, using a very fast decision\nprocedure. We also show how to apply this technique for approximating distance\nselection (with respect to rank), and for computing the semi-continuous\nFr\\'echet distance with one-sided shortcuts.\n",

Volumetric\nparameterization is typically helpful in solving complicated geometric problems\npertaining to shape matching, morphing, path planning of robots, and\nisogeometric analysis etc. A novel method is proposed in which a volume\nparameterization is developed by mapping a general non-convex (genus-0) domain\nto its topologically equivalent convex domain.

The gradients of the potential\nvalues are used to track the streamlines which originate from the boundary and\nconverge to a single point, referred to as the shape center. Each streamline\napproaches the shape center at a unique polar angle and an azimuthal angle .\nOnce all the three parameters (potential value, polar angle, azimuthal angle)\nnecessary to represent any point in the given domain are available, the domain\nis said to be parameterized.

The points are assumed to be\nsampled from some metric space, and the mapping attempts to preserve the\ndistances between each pair of points in the set. Distances in the target space\ncan be computed analytically in this setting. Generalized MDS is an extension\nthat allows mapping one metric space into another, that is, multidimensional\nscaling into target spaces in which distances are evaluated numerically rather\nthan analytically. Here, we propose an efficient approach for computing such\nmappings between surfaces based on their natural spectral decomposition, where\nthe surfaces are treated as sampled metric-spaces. The resulting spectral-GMDS\nprocedure enables efficient embedding by implicitly incorporating smoothness of\nthe mapping into the problem, thereby substantially reducing the complexity\ninvolved in its solution while practically overcoming its non-convex nature.\nThe method is compared to existing techniques that compute dense correspondence\nbetween shapes. Numerical experiments of the proposed method demonstrate its\nefficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches.\n",

To avoid such problems, we introduce a\ngraph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces on cuboid meshes\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The method for the generation of iso-surfaces employs\nlabeled cuboid graphs $G(V,E,\\mathcal{F})$ such that $V$ is the set of vertices\nof a cuboid $C\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$, $E$ is the set of edges of $C$ and\n$\\mathcal{F}\\,:\\,V\\rightarrow [0,1]$. The nodes of $G$ are weighted by the\nvalues of $\\mathcal{F}$ which represents the volumetric information, e.g.\\ from\na Volume of Fluid method. Using a given iso-level $c\\in (0,1)$, we first obtain\nall iso-points, i.e.\\ points where the value $c$ is attained by the\nedge-interpolated $\\mathcal{F}$-field. The iso-surface is then built from\niso-elements which are composed of triangles and are such that their polygonal\nboundary has only iso-points as vertices. All vertices lie on the faces of a\nsingle mesh cell.\n  We give a proof that the generated iso-surface is connected up to the\nboundary of the domain and it can be decomposed into different oriented\ncomponents. Two different components may have discrete points or line segments\nin common. The graph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces\ndeveloped in this paper enables to recover local information of the iso-surface\nthat can be used e.g.\\ to compute discrete mean curvature and to solve surface\nPDEs. Concerning the computational effort, the resulting algorithm is as\nefficient as existing combinatorial methods.\n",

More than two decades of research has succeeded in settling the\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximability status for most geometric set-cover problems,\nexcept for four basic scenarios which are still lacking. One is that of\nweighted disks in the plane for which, after a series of papers, Varadarajan\n(STOC 2010) presented a clever \\emph{quasi-sampling} technique, which together\nwith improvements by Chan \\etal~(SODA 2012), yielded a $O(1)$-approximation\nalgorithm. Even for the unweighted case, a PTAS for a fundamental class of\nobjects called pseudodisks (which includes disks, unit-height rectangles,\ntranslates of convex sets etc.) is currently unknown. Another fundamental case\nis weighted halfspaces in $\\Re^3$, for which a PTAS is currently lacking. In\nthis paper, we present a QPTAS for all of these remaining problems. Our results\nare based on the separator framework of Adamaszek-Wiese (FOCS 2013, SODA 2014),\nwho recently obtained a QPTAS for weighted independent set of polygonal\nregions.

We generalize\nthis result to graphs embedded on surfaces of fixed genus with a fixed number\nof apices, making progress toward the conjecture that graphs excluding a fixed\nminor can also be covered by a constant number of balls. To do so, we develop\ntwo tools which may be of independent interest. The first gives a bound on the\ndensity of graphs drawn on a surface of genus $g$ having a limit on the number\nof pairwise-crossing edges. The second bounds the size of a non-contractible\ncycle in terms of the Euclidean norm of the degree sequence of a graph embedded\non surface.\n",

The contour tree is a\nfundamental topological structure that tracks the evolution of level sets of\n$f$ and has numerous applications in data analysis and visualization.\n  All existing algorithms begin with a global sort of at least all critical\nvalues of $f$, which can require (roughly) $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ time. Existing\nlower bounds show that there are pathological instances where this sort is\nrequired. We present the first algorithm whose time complexity depends on the\ncontour tree structure, and avoids the global sort for non-pathological inputs.\nIf $C$ denotes the set of critical points in $\\mathbb{M}$, the running time is\nroughly $O(\\sum_{v \\in C} \\log \\ell_v)$, where $\\ell_v$ is the depth of $v$ in\nthe contour tree. This matches all existing upper bounds, but is a significant\nimprovement when the contour tree is short and fat. Specifically, our approach\nensures that any comparison made is between nodes in the same descending path\nin the contour tree, allowing us to argue strong optimality properties of our\nalgorithm.\n  Our algorithm requires several novel ideas: partitioning $\\mathbb{M}$ in\nwell-behaved portions, a local growing procedure to iteratively build contour\ntrees, and the use of heavy path decompositions for the time complexity\nanalysis.\n",

Moreover, the performance of these\ndepends not only on the number $n$ of transmitters and on the approximation\nparameter $\\varepsilon$, but also on some geometric parameters that cannot be\nbounded a priori as a function of $n$ or $\\varepsilon$.\n  We address the question of batched point location queries, i.e., answering\nmany queries simultaneously. Specifically, in one dimension, we can answer $n$\nqueries exactly in amortized polylogarithmic time per query, while in the plane\nwe can do it approximately.\n  All these results can handle arbitrary power assignments to the transmitters.\nMoreover, the amortized query time in these results depends only on $n$ and\n$\\varepsilon$.\n  We also show how to speed up the preprocessing in a previously proposed\npoint-location structure in SINR diagram for uniform-power sites, by almost a\nfull order of magnitude. For this we obtain results on the sensitivity of the\nreception regions to slight changes in the reception threshold, which are of\nindependent interest.\n  Finally, these results demonstrate the (so far underutilized) power of\ncombining algebraic tools with those of computational geometry and other\nfields.\n",

Points $p$ and $q$ in\nan orthogonal polygon are r-visible to each other if the rectangle spanned by\nthe points is contained in $P$.

Its efficiency stems in part from a property for Minkowski sums of\npolygons with holes, which in fact holds in any dimension: Given two polygons\nwith holes, for each input polygon we can fill up the holes that are relatively\nsmall compared to the other polygon. Specifically, we can always fill up all\nthe holes of at least one polygon, transforming it into a simple polygon, and\nstill obtain exactly the same Minkowski sum. Obliterating holes in the input\nsummands speeds up the computation of Minkowski sums.\n  We introduce a robust implementation of the new algorithm, which follows the\nExact Geometric Computation paradigm and thus guarantees exact results. We also\npresent an empirical comparison of the performance of Minkowski sum\nconstruction of various input examples, where we show that the implementation\nof the new algorithm exhibits better performance than several other\nimplementations in many cases. In particular, we compared the implementation of\nthe new algorithm, an implementation of the standard convolution algorithm, and\nan implementation of the decomposition approach using various convex\ndecomposition methods, including two new methods that handle polygons with\nholes - one is based on vertical decomposition and the other is based on\ntriangulation.\n  The software has been developed as an extension of the \"2D Minkowski Sums\"\npackage of CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library).

This\ntopological perspective along with the metric space viewpoint provide a new\nangle to the graph matching problem. Our persistence-distortion distance has\ntwo properties not shared by previous methods: First, it is stable against the\nperturbations of the input graph metrics. Second, it is a continuous distance\nmeasure, in the sense that it is defined on an alignment of the underlying\nspaces of input graphs, instead of merely their nodes. This makes our\npersistence-distortion distance robust against, for example, different\ndiscretizations of the same underlying graph.

In the foreseeable future, cars will have the\nability to communicate with one another in order to better coordinate their\nmotion. This motivates a number of interesting algorithmic problems. One of the\nmost challenging aspects of traffic coordination involves traffic\nintersections. In this paper we consider two formulations of a simple and\nfundamental geometric optimization problem involving coordinating the motion of\nvehicles through an intersection.\n  We are given a set of $n$ vehicles in the plane, each modeled as a unit\nlength line segment that moves monotonically, either horizontally or\nvertically, subject to a maximum speed limit. Each vehicle is described by a\nstart and goal position and a start time and deadline. The question is whether,\nsubject to the speed limit, there exists a collision-free motion plan so that\neach vehicle travels from its start position to its goal position prior to its\ndeadline.\n  We present three results. We begin by showing that this problem is\nNP-complete with a reduction from 3-SAT. Second, we consider a constrained\nversion in which cars traveling horizontally can alter their speeds while cars\ntraveling vertically cannot. We present a simple algorithm that solves this\nproblem in $O(n \\log n)$ time.

Common algorithms to construct the\nconvex hull on a finite set of n points (x,y) range from O(nlogn) time to O(n)\ntime. However, it is often the case that a heuristic procedure is applied to\nreduce the original set of n points to a set of s < n points which contains the\nhull and so accelerates the final hull finding procedure. We present an\nalgorithm to precondition data before building a 2D convex hull with integer\ncoordinates, with three distinct advantages. First, for all practical purposes,\nit is linear; second, no explicit sorting of data is required and third, the\nreduced set of s points is constructed such that it forms an ordered set that\ncan be directly pipelined into an O(n) time convex hull algorithm. Under these\ncriteria a fast (or O(n)) pre-conditioner in principle creates a fast convex\nhull (approximately O(n)) for an arbitrary set of points. The paper empirically\nevaluates and quantifies the acceleration generated by the method against the\nmost common convex hull algorithms. An extra acceleration of at least four\ntimes when compared to previous existing preconditioning methods is found from\nexperiments on a dataset.\n",

This\npredicate reduces to evaluating the sign of a multivariate polynomial of degree\n$d+2$ in the coordinates of the points $x, \\, p_0,\\, \\ldots,\\, p_d$. Despite\nmuch progress on exact geometric computing, the fact that the degree of the\npolynomial increases with $d$ makes the evaluation of the sign of such a\npolynomial problematic except in very low dimensions. In this paper, we propose\na new approach that is based on the witness complex, a weak form of the\nDelaunay complex introduced by Carlsson and de Silva. The witness complex\n$\\mathrm{Wit} (L,W)$ is defined from two sets $L$ and $W$ in some metric space\n$X$: a finite set of points $L$ on which the complex is built, and a set $W$ of\nwitnesses that serves as an approximation of $X$. A fundamental result of de\nSilva states that $\\mathrm{Wit}(L,W)=\\mathrm{Del} (L)$ if $W=X=\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nIn this paper, we give conditions on $L$ that ensure that the witness complex\nand the Delaunay triangulation coincide when $W$ is a finite set, and we\nintroduce a new perturbation scheme to compute a perturbed set $L'$ close to\n$L$ such that $\\mathrm{Del} (L')= \\mathrm{wit} (L', W)$. Our perturbation\nalgorithm is a geometric application of the Moser-Tardos constructive proof of\nthe Lov\\'asz local lemma. The only numerical operations we use are (squared)\ndistance comparisons (i.e., predicates of degree 2). The time-complexity of the\nalgorithm is sublinear in $|W|$. Interestingly, although the algorithm does not\ncompute any measure of simplex quality, a lower bound on the thickness of the\noutput simplices can be guaranteed.\n",

This paper presents a novel method\nfor generating space filling curves for 3D sensor networks that are distributed\ndensely on some two-dimensional geometric surface. Our algorithm is completely\ndistributed and constructs a path which gets uniformly, progressively denser as\nit becomes longer. We analyze the algorithm mathematically and prove that the\ncurve we obtain is dense. Our method is based on the Hodge decomposition\ntheorem and uses holomorphic differentials on Riemann surfaces. The underlying\nhigh genus surface is conformally mapped to a union of flat tori and then a\nproportionally-dense space filling curve on this union is constructed. The\npullback of this curve to the original network gives us the desired curve.\n",

When a robot can reach the activated beacon by\nthis method, we say that the beacon attracts the robot.

We first discard the interior points that locate inside\na quadrilateral formed by four extreme points, and then distribute the\nremaining points into several (typically four) sub regions.

The\nproposed algorithm is composed of two stages: (1) two rounds of preprocessing\nperformed on the GPU and (2) the finalization of finding the convex hull on the\nCPU. We first discard the interior points that locate inside a quadrilateral\nformed by four extreme points, sort the remaining points according to the\nangles, and then divide them into the left and the right regions. For each\nregion, we perform a second round of filtering using the proposed preprocessing\napproach to discard the interior points in further. We finally obtain the\nexpected convex hull by calculating the convex hull of the remaining points on\nthe CPU. We directly employ the parallel sorting, reduction, and partitioning\nprovided by the library Thrust for better efficiency and simplicity.\nExperimental results show that our implementation achieves 6x ~ 7x speedups\nover the Qhull implementation for 20M points.\n",

Both players can move in a\nstraight line to any point within unit distance during their turn. The pursuer\n$P$ wins by capturing the evader, meaning that their distance satisfies $d(P,\nE) \\leq 1$, while the evader wins by eluding capture forever. Both players have\na map of the environment, but they have different sensing capabilities. The\nevader $E$ always knows the location of $P$. Meanwhile, $P$ only has\nline-of-sight visibility: $P$ observes the evader's position only when the line\nsegment connecting them lies entirely within the polygon. Therefore $P$ must\nsearch for $E$ when the evader is hidden from view.\n  We provide a winning strategy for $P$ in two families of polygons: monotone\npolygons and scallop polygons. In both families, a straight line $L$ can be\nmoved continuously over $Q$ so that (1) $L \\cap Q$ is a line segment and (2)\nevery point on the boundary $\\partial Q$ is swept exactly once. These are both\nsubfamilies of strictly sweepable polygons. The sweeping motion for a monotone\npolygon is a single translation, and the sweeping motion for a scallop polygon\nis a single rotation. Our algorithms use rook's strategy during its pursuit\nphase, rather than the well-known lion's strategy. The rook's strategy is\ncrucial for obtaining a capture time that is linear in the area of $Q$. For\nboth monotone and scallop polygons, our algorithm has a capture time of $O(n(Q)\n+ \\mbox{area}(Q))$, where $n(Q)$ is the number of polygon vertices.\n",

Here, we have a set of\npoints in the plane and we want to connect them with straight line segments,\nsuch that there is a path between each pair of points that does not make a\nlarge detour. If we achieve this, the resulting graph is called a spanner. We\nfocus our attention on $\\Theta$-graphs, which are constructed by connecting\neach point with its nearest neighbour in a fixed number of cones. Although this\nconstruction is very straight-forward, it has proven challenging to fully\ndetermine the properties of the resulting graphs. We show that if the\nconstruction uses 5 cones, the resulting graphs are still spanners. This was\nthe only number of cones for which this question remained unanswered. We also\npresent a routing strategy on the half-$\\Theta_6$-graph, a variant of the graph\nwith 6 cones. We show that our routing strategy finds a path whose length is at\nmost a constant factor from the straight-line distance between the endpoints.\nMoreover, we show that this routing strategy is optimal.\n  In the second part, we turn our attention to flips in triangulations. A flip\nis a simple operation that transforms one triangulation into another. It turns\nout that with enough flips, we can transform any triangulation into any other.\nBut how many flips is enough? We present an improved upper bound of $5.2n -\n33.6$ on the maximum flip distance between any pair of triangulations with n\nvertices. Along the way, we prove matching lower bounds on each step in the\ncurrent algorithm, including a tight bound of $(3n - 9)/5$ flips needed to make\na triangulation 4-connected. In addition, we prove tight $\\Theta(n \\log n)$\nbounds on the number of flips required in several settings where the edges have\nunique labels.\n",

However, such kind of algorithms may suffer\nfrom heavy simplex volume computations in numerical optimization, etc. In this\nwork, without involving any simplex volume computations, by exploiting a convex\ngeometry fact that a simplest simplex of N vertices can be defined by N\nassociated hyperplanes, we propose a fast blind HU algorithm, for which each of\nthe N hyperplanes associated with the Craig's simplex of N vertices is\nconstructed from N-1 affinely independent data pixels, together with an\nendmember identifiability analysis for its performance support.

Bend and layer complexities\nare two important aesthetics of such a drawing. The bend complexity of $\\Gamma$\nis the maximum number of bends per edge in $\\Gamma$, and the layer complexity\nof $\\Gamma$ is the minimum integer $r$ such that the set of polygonal chains in\n$\\Gamma$ can be partitioned into $r$ disjoint sets, where each set corresponds\nto a planar polyline drawing. Let $G$ be a graph of thickness $t$. By\nF\\'{a}ry's theorem, if $t=1$, then $G$ can be drawn on a single layer with bend\ncomplexity $0$. A few extensions to higher thickness are known, e.g., if $t=2$\n(resp., $t>2$), then $G$ can be drawn on $t$ layers with bend complexity 2\n(resp., $3n+O(1)$). However, allowing a higher number of layers may reduce the\nbend complexity, e.g., complete graphs require $\\Theta(n)$ layers to be drawn\nusing 0 bends per edge.\n  In this paper we present an elegant extension of F\\'{a}ry's theorem to draw\ngraphs of thickness $t>2$. We first prove that thickness-$t$ graphs can be\ndrawn on $t$ layers with $2.25n+O(1)$ bends per edge.

Previously, the bend complexity was not known to be sublinear for\n$t>2$.

The main idea is to reduce the\nproblem of counting geometric graphs to counting source-sink paths in a\ndirected acyclic graph.\n  The following new results will emerge.

Each step is a unidirectional linear morph, which means that\nevery vertex moves at constant speed along a straight line, and the lines are\nparallel although the vertex speeds may differ.

With schematic maps, however, this\nsimplification is pushed far beyond the legibility threshold and is instead\nconstrained by functional need and resemblance. Moreover, stylistic geometry is\noften used to convey the schematic nature of the map. In this paper we explore\ndiscretized approaches to computing a schematic shape $S$ for a simple polygon\n$P$. We do so by overlaying a plane graph $G$ on $P$ as the solution space for\nthe schematic shape. Topological constraints imply that $S$ should describe a\nsimple polygon. We investigate two approaches, simple map matching and\nconnected face selection, based on commonly used similarity metrics.\n  With the former, $S$ is a simple cycle $C$ in $G$ and we quantify resemblance\nvia the Fr\\'echet distance. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute a cycle that\napproximates the minimal Fr\\'echet distance over all simple cycles in a plane\ngraph $G$. This result holds even if $G$ is a partial grid graph, if area\npreservation is required and if we assume a given sequence of turns is\nspecified.\n  With the latter, $S$ is a connected face set in $G$, quantifying resemblance\nvia the symmetric difference. Though the symmetric difference seems a less\nstrict measure, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute the optimal face set.\nThis result holds even if $G$ is full grid graph or a triangular or hexagonal\ntiling, and if area preservation is required.

Notably, although the presence of the fence\nlimits searching uncertainty, the location of the fence is unknown, and in the\nworst case analysis is determined adversarially. Nevertheless, the robot has\nthe ability to move in the interior of the circle. In particular the robot can\nattempt a number of chord-jump moves if it happens to be within the fence or if\nan endpoint of the fence is discovered.\n  The optimal solution to our question can be obtained as a solution to a\ncomplicated optimization problem, which involves trigonometric functions, and\ntrigonometric equations that do not admit closed form solutions.

Due to the degrees of invariance of surfaces and that\nof freedom of joints, these operand polytopes are originally unbounded in most\nof the cases (i.e. polyhedra). Homri et al. proposed the introduction of\nvirtual boundaries (called cap half-spaces) over the unbounded displacements of\neach polyhedron to turn them into 6-polytopes. This decision was motivated by\nthe complexity that operating on polyhedra in R6 supposes. However, that\nstrategy has to face the multiplication of the number of cap half-spaces during\nthe computation of Minkowski sums. In general, the time for computing cap\nfacets is greater than for computing facets representing real limits of bounded\ndisplacements. In order to deal with that, this paper proposes the use of the\ntheory of screws to determine the set of displacements that defines the\npositioning of one surface in relation to another. This set of displacements\ndefines the subspace of R6 in which the polytopes of the respective surfaces\nhave to be projected and operated to avoid calculating facets and vertices\nalong the directions of unbounded displacements. With this new strategy it is\npossible to decrease the complexity of the Minkowski sums by reducing the\ndimension of the operands and consequently reducing the computation time. An\nexample illustrates the method and shows the time reduction during the\ncomputations.\n",

If the vertices of $G$ are ordered or partitioned\ninto ordered levels (as they are for leveled graphs), we require that the\nassignment of vertices to circles corresponds to the given ordering or\nleveling. A pair of edges $e$ and $f$ in a graph is independent if $e$ and $f$\ndo not share a vertex.\n  We show that a graph $G$ is radial planar if $G$ has a radial drawing in\nwhich every two independent edges cross an even number of times; the radial\nembedding has the same leveling as the radial drawing. In other words, we\nestablish the strong Hanani-Tutte theorem for radial planarity. This\ncharacterization yields a very simple algorithm for radial planarity testing.\n",

The classical\nmatching problem is to find a matching of maximum size in a given graph. We\nstudy this problem as well as some of its variants on geometric graphs. The\nbottleneck matching problem is to find a maximum matching that minimizes the\nlength of the longest edge. The plane matching problem is to find a maximum\nmatching so that the edges in the matching are pairwise non-crossing. A\ngeometric matching is strong with respect to a given shape $S$ if we can assign\nto each edge in the matching a scaled version of $S$ such that the shapes\nrepresenting the edges are pairwise disjoint. The strong matching problem is to\nfind a maximum strong matching with respect to a given shape. The matching\npacking problem is to pack as many edge-disjoint perfect matchings as possible\ninto a geometric graph. We study these problems and establish lower and upper\nbounds on the size of different kinds of matchings in various geometric graphs.\nWe also present algorithms for computing such matchings. Some of the presented\nbounds are tight, while the others need to be sharpened.\n",

Result (i) is nearly optimal since the size of the output\n$\\varepsilon$-kernel is $\\Theta(1/\\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ in the worst case.\n  These results are all based on an efficient decomposition of a convex body\nusing a hierarchy of Macbeath regions, and contrast to previous solutions that\ndecompose space using quadtrees and grids.

The goal is\nto locate n points (e.g., facilities or persons) in a k-dimensional polytope,\nso that they are far away from each other and from the boundary of the\npolytope. In many real-world scenarios however, the points arrive and depart at\ndifferent times, and decisions must be made without knowing future events.\nTherefore we study, for the first time in the literature, the online dispersion\nproblem in Euclidean space.\n  There are two natural objectives when time is involved: the all-time\nworst-case (ATWC) problem tries to maximize the minimum distance that ever\nappears at any time; and the cumulative distance (CD) problem tries to maximize\nthe integral of the minimum distance throughout the whole time interval.\nInterestingly, the online problems are highly non-trivial even on a segment.\nFor cumulative distance, this remains the case even when the problem is\ntime-dependent but offline, with all the arriving and departure times given in\nadvance.\n  For the online ATWC problem on a segment, we construct a deterministic\npolynomial-time algorithm which is (2ln2+epsilon)-competitive, where epsilon>0\ncan be arbitrarily small and the algorithm's running time is polynomial in\n1/epsilon. We show this algorithm is actually optimal. For the same problem in\na square, we provide a 1.591-competitive algorithm and a 1.183 lower-bound.\nFurthermore, for arbitrary k-dimensional polytopes with k>=2, we provide a\n2/(1-epsilon)-competitive algorithm and a 7/6 lower-bound. Interestingly, for\nthe offline CD problem in arbitrary k-dimensional polytopes, we provide a\npolynomial-time black-box reduction to the online ATWC problem, and the\nresulting competitive ratio increases by a factor of at most 2.\n",

The art gallery problem is a classical problem in\ncomputational geometry. Given a simple polygon $P$ and an integer $k$, the goal\nis to decide if there exists a set $G$ of $k$ guards within $P$ such that every\npoint $p\\in P$ is seen by at least one guard $g\\in G$. Each guard corresponds\nto a point in the polygon $P$, and we say that a guard $g$ sees a point $p$ if\nthe line segment $pg$ is contained in $P$.\n  The art gallery problem has stimulated extensive research in geometry and in\nalgorithms. However, the complexity status of the art gallery problem has not\nbeen resolved. It has long been known that the problem is $\\text{NP}$-hard, but\nno one has been able to show that it lies in $\\text{NP}$. Recently, the\ncomputational geometry community became more aware of the complexity class\n$\\exists \\mathbb{R}$. The class $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$ consists of problems that\ncan be reduced in polynomial time to the problem of deciding whether a system\nof polynomial equations with integer coefficients and any number of real\nvariables has a solution.

We show how to analyze this method by looking at it as an application\nof the theories of composition operators, of matrix representa- tion of\noperators on separable Hilbert spaces, and of the theory of the Finite Section\nMethod. These are three well known fruitful topics in functional analysis. When\napplied to the task of modelling of correspondences of shapes in\nthree-dimensional space, these concepts lead directly to functional maps and\nits associated functional matrices. Mathematically spoken, functional maps are\ncomposition operators between two-dimensional manifolds, and functional\nmatrices are infinite matrix representations of such maps. We present an\nintroduction into the notion and theoretical foundation of the functional\nanalytic framework of the theory of matrix repre- sentation, especially of\ncomposition operators.

And when the container is a right or obtuse triangle, any\nset of circles whose combined area does not exceed the triangle's incircle can\nbe packed.\n  These area conditions are tight, in the sense that for any larger areas,\nthere are sets of circles which cannot be packed. Similar results have long\nbeen known for squares, but to the best of our knowledge, we give the first\nresults of this type for circular objects.\n  Our proofs are constructive: We describe a versatile,\ndivide-and-conquer-based algorithm for packing circles into various container\nshapes with optimal worst-case density. It employs an elegant subdivision\nscheme that recursively splits the circles into two groups and then packs these\ninto subcontainers. We call this algorithm \"Split Packing\". It can be used as a\nconstant-factor approximation algorithm when looking for the smallest container\nin which a given set of circles can be packed, due to its polynomial runtime.\n  A browser-based, interactive visualization of the Split Packing approach and\nother related material can be found at https://morr.cc/split-packing/\n",

In the other words, in the watchman route problem we must\ncompute a shortest watchman route inside a simple polygon of $ n $ vertices\nsuch that all the points interior to the polygon and on its boundary are\nvisible to at least one point on the route. If route and polygon be orthogonal,\nit is called orthogonal watchman route problem. One of the targets of this\nproblem is finding the orthogonal path with the minimum number of bends as\npossible. We present a linear-time algorithm for the orthogonal watchman route\nproblem, in which the given polygon is monotone. Our algorithm can be used also\nfor the problem on simple orthogonal polygons $ P $ for which the dual graph\ninduced by the vertical decomposition of $ P $ is a path, which is called path\npolygon.\n",

This study proposes a novel algorithm to segment regional\nmyocardium-at-risk subtended by any potentially obstructed coronary artery.\nAssuming the geometric triangular mesh models of coronary artery and myocardium\nderived from an individual cardiac computed tomography image, the proposed\nalgorithm performs (i) computation of the medial axis of the coronary artery\nand (ii) segmentation of the coronary artery and myocardium using the medial\naxis. The algorithm provides the fused segmentation of coronary artery and\nmyocardium via the medial axis.

Though\nit is surprising that such an abstract measure of structure - counting pieces\nand holes - could be useful for real-world data, TDA lets us compare different\nsystems, and even do membership testing or change-point detection. However, TDA\nis computationally expensive and involves a number of free parameters. This\ncomplexity can be obviated by coarse-graining, using a construct called the\nwitness complex. The parametric dependence gives rise to the concept of\npersistent homology: how shape changes with scale. Its results allow us to\ndistinguish time-series data from different systems - e.g., the same note\nplayed on different musical instruments.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper, a novel technique for tight outer-approximation of the\nintersection region of a finite number of ellipses in 2-dimensional (2D) space\nis proposed. First, the vertices of a tight polygon that contains the convex\nintersection of the ellipses are found in an efficient manner. To do so, the\nintersection points of the ellipses that fall on the boundary of the\nintersection region are determined, and a set of points is generated on the\nelliptic arcs connecting every two neighbouring intersection points. By finding\nthe tangent lines to the ellipses at the extended set of points, a set of\nhalf-planes is obtained, whose intersection forms a polygon. To find the\npolygon more efficiently, the points are given an order and the intersection of\nthe half-planes corresponding to every two neighbouring points is calculated.\nIf the polygon is convex and bounded, these calculated points together with the\ninitially obtained intersection points will form its vertices. If the polygon\nis non-convex or unbounded, we can detect this situation and then generate\nadditional discrete points only on the elliptical arc segment causing the\nissue, and restart the algorithm to obtain a bounded and convex polygon.\nFinally, the smallest area ellipse that contains the vertices of the polygon is\nobtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Through numerical\nexperiments, it is illustrated that the proposed technique returns a tighter\nouter-approximation of the intersection of multiple ellipses, compared to\nconventional techniques, with only slightly higher computational cost.\n",

Recently, Chaplick et al. [GD 2016] introduced a different\nmeasure for the visual complexity, the \\emph{affine cover number}, which is the\nminimum number of lines (or planes) that together cover a crossing-free\nstraight-line drawing of a graph $G$ in 2D (3D). In this paper, we introduce\nthe \\emph{spherical cover number}, which is the minimum number of circles (or\nspheres) that together cover a crossing-free circular-arc drawing in 2D (or\n3D). It turns out that spherical covers are sometimes significantly smaller\nthan affine covers. Moreover, there are highly symmetric graphs that have\nsymmetric optimum spherical covers but apparently no symmetric optimum affine\ncover. For complete, complete bipartite, and platonic graphs, we analyze their\nspherical cover numbers and compare them to their affine cover numbers as well\nas their segment and arc numbers. We also link the spherical cover number to\nother graph parameters such as chromatic number, treewidth, and linear\narboricity.\n",

We divide each input layer\ninto a set of strata, each having a different constant color. By locally\nchanging the thickness of the stratum, we change the perceived color at a given\nlocation. By optimizing the choice of colors of each stratum, we further\nimprove quality and allow the use of different numbers of input filaments.\n  We demonstrate our results by building a functional color printer using low\ncost, off-the-shelves components.

More formally, every point in $P$ is within\ndistance $\\epsilon$ from the convex hull of $S$. Such a subset $S$ is called an\n$\\epsilon$-hull. Computing an $\\epsilon$-hull is an important problem in\ncomputational geometry, machine learning, and approximation algorithms.\n  In many real world applications, the set $P$ is too large to fit in memory.\nWe consider the streaming model where the algorithm receives the points of $P$\nsequentially and strives to use a minimal amount of memory. Existing streaming\nalgorithms for computing an $\\epsilon$-hull require $O(\\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$\nspace, which is optimal for a worst-case input. However, this ignores the\nstructure of the data. The minimal size of an $\\epsilon$-hull of $P$, which we\ndenote by $\\text{OPT}$, can be much smaller. A natural question is whether a\nstreaming algorithm can compute an $\\epsilon$-hull using only $O(\\text{OPT})$\nspace.\n  We begin with lower bounds that show that it is not possible to have a\nsingle-pass streaming algorithm that computes an $\\epsilon$-hull with\n$O(\\text{OPT})$ space. We instead propose three relaxations of the problem for\nwhich we can compute $\\epsilon$-hulls using space near-linear to the optimal\nsize.

Most standard versions of this problem are known to be NP-hard. In\n1987, Ghosh provided a deterministic $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$-approximation\nalgorithm for the case of vertex guards and edge guards in simple polygons. In\nthe same paper, Ghosh also conjectured the existence of constant ratio\napproximation algorithms for these problems. We present here three\npolynomial-time algorithms with a constant approximation ratio for guarding an\n$n$-sided simple polygon $P$ using vertex guards. (i) The first algorithm, that\nhas an approximation ratio of 18, guards all vertices of $P$ in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ time. (ii) The second algorithm, that has the same\napproximation ratio of 18, guards the entire boundary of $P$ in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ time. (iii) The third algorithm, that has an approximation\nratio of 27, guards all interior and boundary points of $P$ in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ time. Further, these algorithms can be modified to obtain\nsimilar approximation ratios while using edge guards. The significance of our\nresults lies in the fact that these results settle the conjecture by Ghosh\nregarding the existence of constant-factor approximation algorithms for this\nproblem, which has been open since 1987 despite several attempts by\nresearchers. Our approximation algorithms exploit several deep visibility\nstructures of simple polygons which are interesting in their own right.\n",

It is well known that\nthe cube has five subdivisions into 6 tetrahedra and one subdivision into 5\ntetrahedra. However, all hexahedra are not cubes and moving the vertex\npositions increases the number of subdivisions. Recent hexahedral dominant\nmeshing methods try to take these configurations into account for combining\ntetrahedra into hexahedra, but fail to enumerate them all: they use only a set\nof 10 subdivisions among the 174 we found in this article.\n  The enumeration of these 174 subdivisions of the hexahedron into tetrahedra\nis our combinatorial result. Each of the 174 subdivisions has between 5 and 15\ntetrahedra and is actually a class of 2 to 48 equivalent instances which are\nidentical up to vertex relabeling. We further show that exactly 171 of these\nsubdivisions have a geometrical realization, i.e. there exist coordinates of\nthe eight hexahedron vertices in a three-dimensional space such that the\ngeometrical tetrahedral mesh is valid. We exhibit the tetrahedral meshes for\nthese configurations and show in particular subdivisions of hexahedra with 15\ntetrahedra that have a strictly positive Jacobian.\n",

This information is called the order type of\nthe point set. In the dual, realizable order types and abstract order types are\ncombinatorial analogues of line arrangements and pseudoline arrangements. Too\noften in the literature we analyze algorithms in the real-RAM model for\nsimplicity, putting aside the fact that computers as we know them cannot handle\narbitrary real numbers without some sort of encoding. Encoding an order type by\nthe integer coordinates of some realizing point set is known to yield doubly\nexponential coordinates in some cases. Other known encodings can achieve\nquadratic space or fast orientation queries, but not both. In this\ncontribution, we give a compact encoding for abstract order types that allows\nefficient query of the orientation of any triple: the encoding uses O(n^2) bits\nand an orientation query takes O(log n) time in the word-RAM model. This\nencoding is space-optimal for abstract order types. We show how to shorten the\nencoding to O(n^2 (loglog n)^2 / log n) bits for realizable order types, giving\nthe first subquadratic encoding for those order types with fast orientation\nqueries. We further refine our encoding to attain O(log n/loglog n) query time\nwithout blowing up the space requirement. In the realizable case, we show that\nall those encodings can be computed efficiently.

We present \"All Vertex Triangle\nAlgorithm\" (AVTA), a robust and efficient algorithm for computing the subset\n$\\overline S$ of all $K$ vertices of $conv(S)$, the convex hull of $S$. If\n$\\Gamma_*$ is the minimum of the distances from each vertex to the convex hull\nof the remaining vertices, given any $\\gamma \\leq \\gamma_* = \\Gamma_*/R$, $R$\nthe diameter of $S$, $AVTA$ computes $\\overline S$ in $O(nK(m+ \\gamma^{-2}))$\noperations. If $\\gamma_*$ is unknown but $K$ is known, AVTA computes $\\overline\nS$ in $O(nK(m+ \\gamma_*^{-2})) \\log(\\gamma_*^{-1})$ operations. More generally,\ngiven $t \\in (0,1)$, AVTA computes a subset $\\overline S^t$ of $\\overline S$ in\n$O(n |\\overline S^t|(m+ t^{-2}))$ operations, where the distance between any $p\n\\in conv(S)$ to $conv(\\overline S^t)$ is at most $t R$. Next we consider AVTA\nwhere input is $S_\\varepsilon$, an $\\varepsilon$ perturbation of $S$. Assuming\na bound on $\\varepsilon$ in terms of the minimum of the distances of vertices\nof $conv(S)$ to the convex hull of the remaining point of $S$, we derive\nanalogous complexity bounds for computing $\\overline S_\\varepsilon$. We also\nanalyze AVTA under random projections of $S$ or $S_\\varepsilon$. Finally, via\nAVTA we design new practical algorithms for two popular machine learning\nproblems: topic modeling and non-negative matrix factorization.

We improve the known upper bounds on the\nnumber of edges required to guard any $n$-vertex embedded planar graph $G$:\n  1- We present a simple inductive proof for a theorem of Everett and\nRivera-Campo (1997) that $G$ can be guarded with at most $ \\frac{2n}{5}$ edges,\nthen extend this approach with a deeper analysis to yield an improved bound of\n$\\frac{3n}{8}$ edges for any plane graph.\n  2- We prove that there exists an edge guard set of $G$ with at most\n$\\frac{n}{3}+\\frac{\\alpha}{9}$ edges, where $\\alpha$ is the number of\nquadrilateral faces in $G$. This improves the previous bound of $\\frac{n}{3} +\n\\alpha$ by Bose, Kirkpatrick, and Li (2003).

We\nintroduce Self Functional Maps as a novel surface representation that satisfies\nthese properties, translating the geometric problem of surface classification\ninto an algebraic form of classifying matrices. The proposed map transforms a\ngiven surface into a universal isometry invariant form defined by a unique\nmatrix. The suggested representation is realized by applying the functional\nmaps framework to map the surface into itself. The key idea is to use two\ndifferent metric spaces of the same surface for which the functional map serves\nas a signature. Specifically, in this paper, we use the regular and the scale\ninvariant surface laplacian operators to construct two families of\neigenfunctions. The result is a matrix that encodes the interaction between the\neigenfunctions resulted from two different Riemannian manifolds of the same\nsurface. Using this representation, geometric shape similarity is converted\ninto algebraic distances between matrices.\n",

Consequently, any existing heuristic or\nalgorithm can run on the core-set to achieve a great improvement on the\nefficiency. As a new application of core-set, it needs to tackle a couple of\nchallenges particularly in theory.

We\ndevelop a static data structure for the general setting with nearly optimal O(\nn log log n ) space, the optimal O( log n + k ) query time, and expected O( n\npolylog n ) preprocessing time. The O( n log log n ) space approaches the\nlinear space, whose achievability is still unknown with the optimal query time,\nand improves the so far best O( n ( log^2 n )( log log n )^2 ) space of Bohler\net al.'s work. Our dynamic version (that allows insertions and deletions of\nsites) also reduces the space of Kaplan et al.'s work from O( n log^3 n ) to O(\nn log n ).\n  To obtain these progresses, we devise shallow cuttings of linear size for\ngeneral distance functions. Shallow cuttings are a key technique to deal with\nthe k nearest neighbors problem for point sites in the Euclidean metric.\nAgarwal et al. already designed linear-size shallow cuttings for general\ndistance functions, but their shallow cuttings could not be applied to the k\nnearest neighbors problem.

The\ntree-like shapes of neurons cannot mathematically be adequately described as\npoints in a vector space. There is therefore a need for new approaches. Methods\nfrom computational topology and geometry are naturally suited to the analysis\nof neuronal shapes. Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse Theory to\nextract tree-skeletons of individual neurons from volumetric brain image data,\nor to summarize collections of neurons labelled by localized anterograde tracer\ninjections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible to\nsummarize the collection of neurons labelled by a localized anterograde tracer\ninjection using a consensus tree-shape. The algorithmic procedure includes an\ninitial pre-processing step to extract a density field from the raw volumetric\nimage data, followed by initial skeleton extraction from the density field\nusing a discrete version of a 1-(un)stable manifold of the density field.\nHeuristically, if the density field is regarded as a mountainous landscape,\nthen the 1-(un)stable manifold follows the \"mountain ridges\" connecting the\nmaxima of the density field.

The halfspace depth of a query point $q\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to $S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ is the minimum portion of\nthe elements of $S$ which are contained in a halfspace which passes through\n$q$. For $\\beta \\geq 1$, the $\\beta$-skeleton depth of $q$ with respect to $S$\nis defined to be the total number of \\emph{$\\beta$-skeleton influence regions}\nthat contain $q$, where each of these influence regions is the intersection of\ntwo hyperballs obtained from a pair of points in $S$. The $\\beta$-skeleton\ndepth introduces a family of depth functions that contain \\emph{spherical\ndepth} and \\emph{lens depth} if $\\beta=1$ and $\\beta=2$, respectively. The main\nresults of this paper include approximating the planar halfspace depth and\n$\\beta$-skeleton depth using two different approximation methods. First, the\nhalfspace depth is approximated by the $\\beta$-skeleton depth values. For this\nmethod, two dissimilarity measures based on the concepts of \\emph{fitting\nfunction} and \\emph{Hamming distance} are defined to train the halfspace depth\nfunction by the $\\beta$-skeleton depth values obtaining from a given data set.\nThe goodness of this approximation is measured by a function of error values.\nSecondly, computing the planar $\\beta$-skeleton depth is reduced to a\ncombination of some range counting problems.

Regarding\nthe $\\beta$-skeleton depth functions, it is also proved that this family of\ndepth functions converge when $\\beta \\to \\infty$.

Such a graph was introduced by Huemer and\nP\\'erez-Lantero in 2016, proved to be planar and Hamiltonian. In this paper we\nstudy further combinatorial properties of this graph. We prove that the\ntreewidth is at most 3, by showing an $O(n)$-time algorithm that builds a tree\ndecomposition of width at most 3, given the polygon as input. This implies that\nwe can construct the intersection graph of the side disks in $O(n)$ time. We\nfurther study the independence number of this graph, which is the maximum\nnumber of pairwise disjoint disks. The planarity condition implies that for\nevery convex $n$-gon we can select at least $\\lceil n/4 \\rceil$ pairwise\ndisjoint disks, and we prove that for every $n\\ge 3$ there exist convex\n$n$-gons in which we cannot select more than this number.

Geometric methods should be examined for each individual point in\nneighborhood data set so that similar groups would be formed. Those algorithms\nare not highly accurate for high dimension of data.

For efficient clustering, our algorithm works better with high\ndimension of data than the previous methods; it is also able to identify the\nlocal outlier data.

Interestingly, given a ER-perturbed random geometric graph, we\nshow that the edge clique number presents two fundamentally different types of\nbehaviors, depending on which \"type\" of randomness it is generated from. As an\napplication of the above results, we show that by using a filtering process\nbased on the edge clique number, we can recover the shortest-path metric of the\nrandom geometric graph $G_\\mathcal{X}^*$ within a multiplicative factor of $3$,\nfrom an ER-perturbed observed graph $\\widehat{G}(p,q)$, for a significantly\nwider range of insertion probability $q$ than in previous work.\n",

Introduced by Hart\n(1968), a consistent subset of $P$, is a set $S\\subseteq P$ such that for every\npoint $p$ in $P\\setminus S$, the closest point of $p$ in $S$ has the same color\nas $p$. The consistent subset problem is to find a consistent subset of $P$\nwith minimum cardinality. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for\ntwo-colored point sets. Since the initial presentation of this problem, aside\nfrom the hardness results, there has not been a significant progress from the\nalgorithmic point of view. In this paper we present the following algorithmic\nresults:\n  1. The first subexponential-time algorithm for the consistent subset problem.\n  2. An $O(n\\log n)$-time algorithm that finds a consistent subset of size two\nin two-colored point sets (if such a subset exists). Towards our proof of this\nrunning time we present a deterministic $O(n \\log n)$-time algorithm for\ncomputing a variant of the compact Voronoi diagram; this improves the\npreviously claimed expected running time.\n  3. An $O(n\\log^2 n)$-time algorithm that finds a minimum consistent subset in\ntwo-colored point sets where one color class contains exactly one point; this\nimproves the previous best known $O(n^2)$ running time which is due to Wilfong\n(SoCG 1991).\n  4. An $O(n)$-time algorithm for the consistent subset problem on collinear\npoints; this improves the previous best known $O(n^2)$ running time.\n  5. A non-trivial $O(n^6)$-time dynamic programming algorithm for the\nconsistent subset problem on points arranged on two parallel lines.\n  To obtain these results, we combine tools from planar separators,\nadditively-weighted Voronoi diagrams with respect to convex distance functions,\npoint location in farthest-point Voronoi diagrams, range trees, paraboloid\nlifting, minimum covering of a circle with arcs, and several geometric\ntransformations.\n",

For example in one-dimensional data sets, often certain\nquantiles are chosen as representatives instead of the median. We present a\npossible extension of the concept of quantiles to higher dimensions.

Our NP-hardness result holds even when the subsuming\nchains are restricted to have constant length and lie on the arrangement of\nlines determined by the edges of the input polygon.

In this paper, we apply\nconcepts from locality-sensitive hashing to support approximate nearest\nneighbor search in the space of persistence diagrams.

Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the\nnumber of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms\nis the existence of an orthogonal representation that allows to describe such\ndrawings purely combinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges\naround each vertex and the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any\nkind of geometric information such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths. Barth\net al. [2] have established the existence of an analogous ortho-radial\nrepresentation for ortho-radial drawings, which are embeddings into an\northo-radial grid, whose gridlines are concentric circles around the origin and\nstraight-line spokes emanating from the origin but excluding the origin itself.\nWhile any orthogonal representation admits an orthogonal drawing, it is the\ncircularity of the ortho-radial grid that makes the problem of characterizing\nvalid ortho-radial representations all the more complex and interesting. Barth\net al. prove such a characterization. However, the proof is existential and\ndoes not provide an efficient algorithm for testing whether a given\northo-radial representation is valid, let alone actually obtaining a drawing\nfrom an ortho-radial representation. In this paper we give quadratic-time\nalgorithms for both of these tasks. They are based on a suitably constrained\nleft-first DFS in planar graphs and several new insights on ortho-radial\nrepresentations. Our validity check requires quadratic time, and a naive\napplication of it would yield a quartic algorithm for constructing a drawing\nfrom a valid ortho-radial representation. Using further structural insights we\nspeed up the drawing algorithm to quadratic running time.\n",

Given an\nouterstring graph representation, the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem of\nthe underlying graph can be computed in $O(s^3)$ time, where $s$ is the number\nof segments in the representation (Keil et al., Comput. Geom., 60:19--25,\n2017). If the strings are of constant size (e.g., line segments, L-shapes,\netc.), then the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ time.\n  In this paper, we examine the fine-grained complexity of the MIS problem on\nsome well-known outerstring representations. We show that solving the MIS\nproblem on grounded segment and grounded square-L representations is at least\nas hard as solving MIS on circle graph representations.

Being axially-symmetric, their\nconfiguration space is R^3 x S^2 with 5 degrees of freedom (DOF). Correct,\ncomplete and practical path planning for such robots is a long standing\nchallenge in robotics. While the rod is one of the most widely studied spatial\nrobots in path planning, the ring seems to be new, and a rare example of a\nnon-simply-connected robot. This work provides rigorous and complete algorithms\nfor these robots with theoretical guarantees. We implemented the algorithms in\nour open-source Core Library. Experiments show that they are practical,\nachieving near real-time performance. We compared our planner to\nstate-of-the-art sampling planners in OMPL.\n  Our subdivision path planner is based on the twin foundations of\n\\epsilon-exactness and soft predicates. Correct implementation is relatively\neasy. The technical innovations include subdivision atlases for S^2,\nintroduction of \\Sigma_2 representations for footprints, and extensions of our\nfeature-based technique for \"opening up the blackbox of collision detection\".\n",

The geometrical challenges of the Nesting problem are addressed by\nfocusing on the geometric aspect of the 2D pieces and containers involved. The\nchallenges of the geometrical component are mainly derived from the complexity\nof the pieces, due to high number of vertices, which is common when dealing\nwith real world scenarios.

Each of these shape descriptors essentially defines\na cost capturing the quality of the descriptor and uses the orientation that\nminimizes the cost. This optimal orientation may be very unstable as the points\nare moving, which is undesirable in many practical scenarios. If we bound the\nspeed with which the orientation of the descriptor may change, this may lower\nthe quality of the resulting shape descriptor. In this paper we study the\ntrade-off between stability and quality of these shape descriptors. We first\nshow that there is no stateless algorithm, an algorithm that keeps no state\nover time, that both approximates the minimum cost of a shape descriptor and\nachieves continuous motion for the shape descriptor. On the other hand, if we\ncan use the previous state of the shape descriptor to compute the new state, we\ncan define \"chasing\" algorithms that attempt to follow the optimal orientation\nwith bounded speed. We show that, under mild conditions, chasing algorithms\nwith sufficient bounded speed approximate the optimal cost at all times for\noriented bounding boxes and strips. The analysis of such chasing algorithms is\nchallenging and has received little attention in literature, hence we believe\nthat our methods used in this analysis are of independent interest.\n",

In this paper we show\nhow to make the rounding process perfectly continuous in the sense that it maps\nany pair of sufficiently close measurements to the same point. We call such a\nprocess consistent rounding, and make it possible by allowing a small amount of\ninformation about the first measurement $X_1$ to be unidirectionally\ncommunicated to and used by the rounding process of $X_2$.\n  The fault tolerance of a consistent rounding scheme is defined by the maximum\ndistance between pairs of measurements which guarantees that they are always\nrounded to the same point, and our goal is to study the possible tradeoffs\nbetween the amount of information provided and the achievable fault tolerance\nfor various types of spaces.

In this problem, given two\npolygonal chains $A$ and $B$ of lengths $m$ and $n$, respectively, one needs to\nsimplify them simultaneously, such that each of the resulting simplified\nchains, $A'$ and $B'$, is of length at most $k$ and the discrete \\frechet\\\ndistance between $A'$ and $B'$ is at most $\\delta$, where $k$ and $\\delta$ are\ngiven parameters.\n  In this paper we study the complexity of CPS under the discrete \\frechet\\\ndistance (CPS-3F), i.e., where the quality of the simplifications is also\nmeasured by the discrete \\frechet\\ distance. Since CPS-3F was posed in 2008,\nits complexity has remained open. However, it was believed to be \\npc, since\nCPS under the Hausdorff distance (CPS-2H) was shown to be \\npc. We first prove\nthat the weighted version of CPS-3F is indeed weakly \\npc\\, even on the line,\nbased on a reduction from the set partition problem. Then, we prove that CPS-3F\nis actually polynomially solvable, by presenting an $O(m^2n^2\\min\\{m,n\\})$ time\nalgorithm for the corresponding minimization problem. In fact, we prove a\nstronger statement, implying, for example, that if weights are assigned to the\nvertices of only one of the chains, then the problem remains polynomially\nsolvable. We also study a few less rigid variants of CPS and present efficient\nsolutions for them.\n  Finally, we present some experimental results that suggest that (the\nminimization version of) CPS-3F is significantly better than previous\nalgorithms for the motivating biological application.\n",

In 1998, the problems of finding the minimum number of point\nguards, vertex guards, and edge guards required to guard $P$ were shown to be\nAPX-hard by Eidenbenz, Widmayer and Stamm. In 1987, Ghosh presented\napproximation algorithms for vertex guards and edge guards that achieved a\nratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$, which was improved upto $\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\log\nOPT)$ by King and Kirkpatrick in 2011.

We settle\nthe conjecture for the special class of polygons that are weakly visible from\nan edge and contain no holes by presenting a 6-approximation algorithm for\nfinding the minimum number of vertex guards that runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$\ntime. On the other hand, for weak visibility polygons with holes, we present a\nreduction from the Set Cover problem to show that there cannot exist a\npolynomial time algorithm for the vertex guard problem with an approximation\nratio better than $((1 - \\epsilon)/12)\\ln n$ for any $\\epsilon>0$, unless NP=P.\nWe also show that, for the special class of polygons without holes that are\northogonal as well as weakly visible from an edge, the approximation ratio can\nbe improved to 3.

Firstly, some pre-processing operations including\nB\\'ezier extraction and subdivision are performed on each boundary curve in\norder to generate a high-quality planar parameterization; then a robust planar\ndomain partition framework is proposed to construct high-quality patch-meshing\nresults with few singularities from the discrete boundary formed by connecting\nthe end points of the resulting boundary segments. After the topology\ninformation generation of quadrilateral decomposition, the optimal placement of\ninterior B\\'ezier curves corresponding to the interior edges of the\nquadrangulation is constructed by a global optimization method to achieve a\npatch-partition with high quality. Finally, after the imposition of\nC1=G1-continuity constraints on the interface of neighboring B\\'ezier patches\nwith respect to each quad in the quadrangulation, the high-quality B\\'ezier\npatch parameterization is obtained by a C1-constrained local optimization\nmethod to achieve uniform and orthogonal iso-parametric structures while\nkeeping the continuity conditions between patches.

Our lower bounds imply that any data structure\nin the pointer model model that achieves $Q(n) + O(k)$ query time, where $k$ is\nthe output size, has to use roughly $\\Omega\\left((n/Q(n))^2\\right)$ space in\nthe worst case, even if queries are mere points (for the discrete \\Frechet\ndistance) or line segments (for the continuous \\Frechet distance). More\nimportantly, we show that more complex queries and input curves lead to\nadditional logarithmic factors in the lower bound. Roughly speaking, the number\nof logarithmic factors added is linear in the number of edges added to the\nquery and input curve complexity.

In a first variant, the approximation is made of simplices that\nare defined in the cubes of a regular grid covering the compact set, from\nboundary points that approximate the intersection between $M$ and the edges of\nthe cubes. All the simplices defined in a cube share the barycentre of the\nboundary points located in the cube and include simplices similarly defined in\ncube facets, and so on recursively. In a second variant, the Kuhn triangulation\nis used to break the cubes into simplices and the approximation is defined in\nthese simplices from the boundary points computed on their edges, with the same\nprinciple. Both the approximation in cubes and in simplices define a separating\nsurface on the whole grid and classifying a point on one side or the other of\nthis surface requires only a small number (at most $d$) of simple tests. Under\nsome conditions on the definition of the boundary points and on the reach of\n$M$, for both variants the Hausdorff distance between $M$ and its approximation\ndecreases like $\\mathcal{O}(d n_G^{-2})$, where $n_G$ is the number of points\non each axis of the grid. The approximation in cubes requires computing less\nboundary points than the approximation in simplices but the latter is always a\nmanifold and is more accurate for a given value of $n_G$. The paper reports\ntests of the method when varying $n_G$ and the dimensionality of the space (up\nto 9).\n",

In a geometric context, it provides a way\nto measure the contribution of a geometric object in a set towards some\nfunction on the set. Recently, Cabello and Chan (SoCG 2019) presented\nalgorithms for computing Shapley values for a number of functions for point\nsets in the plane. More formally, a coalition game consists of a set of players\n$N$ and a characteristic function $v: 2^N \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $v(\\emptyset) =\n0$. Let $\\pi$ be a uniformly random permutation of $N$, and $P_N(\\pi, i)$ be\nthe set of players in $N$ that appear before player $i$ in the permutation\n$\\pi$. The Shapley value of the game is defined to be $\\phi(i) =\n\\mathbb{E}_\\pi[v(P_N(\\pi, i) \\cup \\{i\\}) - v(P_N(\\pi, i))]$. More intuitively,\nthe Shapley value represents the impact of player $i$'s appearance over all\ninsertion orders. We present an algorithm to compute Shapley values in 3-D,\nwhere we treat points as players and use the mean width of the convex hull as\nthe characteristic function. Our algorithm runs in $O(n^3\\log^2{n})$ time and\n$O(n)$ space. Our approach is based on a new data structure for a variant of\nthe dynamic convolution problem $(u, v, p)$, where we want to answer $u\\cdot v$\ndynamically. Our data structure supports updating $u$ at position $p$,\nincrementing and decrementing $p$ and rotating $v$ by $1$. We present a data\nstructure that supports $n$ operations in $O(n\\log^2{n})$ time and $O(n)$\nspace. Moreover, the same approach can be used to compute the Shapley values\nfor the mean volume of the convex hull projection onto a uniformly random $(d -\n2)$-subspace in $O(n^d\\log^2{n})$ time and $O(n)$ space for a point set in\n$d$-dimensional space ($d \\geq 3$).\n",

The approach is based on maintaining the edges of the Semi-Yao graph, a\nsparse graph whose edge set includes the pairs of nearest neighbors as a\nsubset.\n  Our kinetic data structure (KDS) for maintaining all the nearest neighbors is\ndeterministic. It processes $O(n^2\\beta_{2s+2}^2(n)\\log n)$ events with a total\ncost of $O(n^2\\beta_{2s+2}(n)\\log^{d+1} n)$. Here, $\\beta_s(n)$ is an extremely\nslow-growing function. The best previous KDS for all the nearest neighbors in $\n\\mathbb{R}^d$ is by Agarwal, Kaplan, and Sharir (TALG 2008). It is a randomized\nresult. Our structure and analysis are simpler than theirs. Also, we improve\ntheir result by a factor of $\\log^d n$ in the number of events and by a $\\log\nn$ factor in the total cost.\n  This paper generalizes and improves the 2013 work of Rahmati, King and\nWhitesides (SoCG 2013) on maintaining the Semi-Yao graph in $\\mathbb{R}^2$; its\nnew technique provides the first KDS for the Semi-Yao graph in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nOur KDS is local in the worst case, meaning that only a constant number of\nevents is associated with any one point at any time.\n  For maintaining all the nearest neighbors, neither our KDS nor the KDS by\nAgarwal~\\etal~is local, and furthermore, each event in our KDS and in their KDS\nis handled in polylogarithmic time in an amortized sense.\n  Finally, in this paper, we also give a KDS for maintenance of all the\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-nearest neighbors which is local and each event can be handled\nin a polylogarithmic worst-case time.\n",

More than 20 years later, the state of\nthe art algorithms for most variants still take time more than O(n^2 / log n),\nbut no matching lower bounds are known, not even under reasonable complexity\ntheoretic assumptions.\n  To obtain a conditional lower bound, in this paper we assume the Strong\nExponential Time Hypothesis or, more precisely, that there is no\nO*((2-delta)^N) algorithm for CNF-SAT for any delta > 0. Under this assumption\nwe show that the Frechet distance cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic\ntime, i.e., in time O(n^{2-delta}) for any delta > 0. This means that finding\nfaster algorithms for the Frechet distance is as hard as finding faster CNF-SAT\nalgorithms, and the existence of a strongly subquadratic algorithm can be\nconsidered unlikely.\n  Our result holds for both the continuous and the discrete Frechet distance.\nWe extend the main result in various directions.

These notions have been studied in analysis,\napproximation theory etc. since the 1940s.\n  We show that 3-monotone interpolability is very non-local: we exhibit an\narbitrarily large finite $P$ for which every proper subset is $3$-monotone\ninterpolable but $P$ itself is not. On the other hand, we prove a Ramsey-type\nresult: for every $n$ there exists $N$ such that every $N$-point $P$ with\ndistinct $x$-coordinates contains an $n$-point $Q$ such that $Q$ or its\nvertical mirror reflection are $3$-monotone interpolable. The analogs for\n$k$-monotone interpolability with $k=1$ and $k=2$ are classical theorems of\nErd\\H{o}s and Szekeres, while the cases with $k\\ge4$ remain open.\n  We also investigate the computational complexity of deciding $3$-monotone\ninterpolability of a given point set. Using a known characterization, this\ndecision problem can be stated as an instance of polynomial optimization and\nreformulated as a semidefinite program. We exhibit an example for which this\nsemidefinite program has only doubly exponentially large feasible solutions,\nand thus known algorithms cannot solve it in polynomial time. While such\nphenomena have been well known for semidefinite programming in general, ours\nseems to be the first such example in polynomial optimization, and it involves\nonly univariate quadratic polynomials.\n",

Given a set of points in the plane, a\n$\\theta$-graph partitions the plane around each vertex into $m$ disjoint cones,\neach having aperture $\\theta=2\\pi/m$, and adds an edge to the `closest' vertex\nin each cone. We show that for any integer $k \\geq 1$, $\\theta$-graphs with\n$4k+2$ cones have a spanning ratio of $1+2\\sin(\\theta/2)$ and we provide a\nmatching lower bound, showing that this spanning ratio tight.\n  Next, we show that for any integer $k \\geq 1$, $\\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$\ncones have spanning ratio at most\n$1+2\\sin(\\theta/2)/(\\cos(\\theta/2)-\\sin(\\theta/2))$. We also show that\n$\\theta$-graphs with $4k+3$ and $4k+5$ cones have spanning ratio at most\n$\\cos(\\theta/4)/(\\cos(\\theta/2)-\\sin(3\\theta/4))$. This is a significant\nimprovement on all families of $\\theta$-graphs for which exact bounds are not\nknown. For example, the spanning ratio of the $\\theta$-graph with 7 cones is\ndecreased from at most 7.5625 to at most 3.5132. These spanning proofs also\nimply improved upper bounds on the competitiveness of the $\\theta$-routing\nalgorithm.

In particular, we show that $\\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones\nhave spanning ratio at least $1+2\\tan(\\theta/2)+2\\tan^2(\\theta/2)$. This is\nsomewhat surprising since, for equal values of $k$, the spanning ratio of\n$\\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones is greater than that of $\\theta$-graphs with\n$4k+2$ cones, showing that increasing the number of cones can make the spanning\nratio worse.\n",

An $\\omega$-wedge consists\nof two rays emanating from a point called the apex of the wedge and the two\nrays forming an angle $\\omega$. To probe with an $\\omega$-wedge, we set the\ndirection that the apex of the probe has to follow, the line $\\overrightarrow\nL$, and the initial orientation of the two rays. A valid $\\omega$-probe of a\nconvex polygon $O$ contains $O$ within the $\\omega$-wedge and its outcome\nconsists of the coordinates of the apex, the orientation of both rays and the\ncoordinates of the closest (to the apex) points of contact between $O$ and each\nof the rays.\n  We present algorithms minimizing the number of probes and prove their\noptimality. In particular, we show how to reconstruct a convex $n$-gon (with\nall internal angles of size larger than $\\omega$) using $2n-2$ $\\omega$-probes;\nif $\\omega = \\pi/2$, the reconstruction uses $2n-3$ $\\omega$-probes.

Unlike in the discrete setting where a\nshortcut connects two vertices and the diameter is measured between vertices,\nwe take all points along the edges of the network into account when placing a\nshortcut and when measuring distances in the augmented network.\n  We study this network augmentation problem for paths and cycles. For paths,\nwe determine an optimal shortcut in linear time. For cycles, we show that a\nsingle shortcut never decreases the continuous diameter and that two shortcuts\nalways suffice to reduce the continuous diameter. Furthermore, we characterize\noptimal pairs of shortcuts for convex and non-convex cycles. Finally, we\ndevelop a linear time algorithm that produces an optimal pair of shortcuts for\nconvex cycles. Apart from the algorithms, our results extend to rectifiable\ncurves.\n  Our work reveals some of the underlying challenges that must be overcome when\naddressing the discrete version of this network augmentation problem, where we\nminimize the discrete diameter of a network with shortcuts that connect only\nvertices.\n",

The simplicial depth,\n$\\sigma_P(q)$ of a point $q$ is the number of $d$-simplices with vertices in\n$P$ that contain $q$ in their convex hulls. The simplicial depth is a notion of\ndata depth with many applications in robust statistics and computational\ngeometry. Computing the simplicial depth of a point is known to be a\nchallenging problem. The trivial solution requires $O(n^{d+1})$ time whereas it\nis generally believed that one cannot do better than $O(n^{d-1})$. In this\npaper, we consider approximation algorithms for computing the simplicial depth\nof a point. For $d=2$, we present a new data structure that can approximate the\nsimplicial depth in polylogarithmic time, using polylogarithmic query time. In\n3D, we can approximate the simplicial depth of a given point in near-linear\ntime, which is clearly optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. For higher\ndimensions, we consider two approximation algorithms with different worst-case\nscenarios. By combining these approaches, we compute a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the simplicial depth in time\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{d/2 + 1})$ ignoring polylogarithmic factor.

In order to not spoil or\nclutter the figure with text, the labels are often placed around the figure and\nare associated by thin connecting lines to their features, respectively. This\nlabeling technique is known as external label placement.\n  In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for external label\nplacement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions\nof the labels. While much research on external label placement aims for fast\nlabeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality\nillustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatic\nanalysis of 202 handmade anatomical drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout\nquality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance. We design a new\ngeometric label placement algorithm that is based only on the most important\ncriteria. Yet, other criteria can flexibly be included in the algorithm, either\nas hard constraints not to be violated or as soft constraints whose violation\nis penalized by a general cost function. We formally prove that our approach\nyields labelings that satisfy all hard constraints and have minimum overall\ncost. Introducing several speedup techniques, we further demonstrate how to\ndeploy our approach in practice.

The spherical depth $\\SphD(q;S)$ is\nalso defined for an arbitrary data set $S\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$. This definition is based on counting all of the closed\nhyper-balls, obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The\nsignificant advantage of using the spherical depth in multivariate data\nanalysis is related to its complexity of computation. Unlike most other data\ndepths, the time complexity of the spherical depth grows linearly rather than\nexponentially in the dimension $d$. The straightforward algorithm for computing\nthe spherical depth in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. The main result of this\npaper is an optimal algorithm that we present for computing the bivariate\nspherical depth. The algorithm takes $O(n \\log n)$ time. By reducing the\nproblem of \\textit{Element Uniqueness}, we prove that computing the spherical\ndepth requires $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ time. Some geometric properties of spherical\ndepth are also investigated in this paper. These properties indicate that\n\\emph{simplicial depth} ($\\SD$) (Liu, 1990) is linearly bounded by spherical\ndepth (in particular, $\\SphD\\geq \\frac{2}{3}SD$). To illustrate this\nrelationship between the spherical depth and the simplicial depth, some\nexperimental results are provided. The obtained experimental bound ($\\SphD\\geq\n2\\SD$) indicates that, perhaps, a stronger theoretical bound can be achieved.\n",

We show that SRTP has no finite solution if the ratio of the two\nparallel side lengths of input rectangles is irrational. So we turn to its\ncomplement denoted by SIRTP, in which case all side lengths can be assumed\nintegral. We give a polynomial time algorithm ALGSIRTP which gives a solution\nat most $q/p+O(\\sqrt{p})$ to SIRTP$(p,q)$ ($q\\geq p$), where $p$ and $q$ are\ntwo integer side lengths of input rectangles $p\\times q$ and $q\\times p$, and\nso ALGSIRTP is a $O(\\sqrt{p})$-approximation algorithm for minimum\nSIRTP$(p,q)$. On the other hand, we show that there is not constant solution to\nSIRTP$(p,q)$ for all integers $p$ and $q$ ($q>p$) even though the ratio $q/p$\nis within any constant range. We also raise a series of open questions for the\nresearch along this line.\n",

Nowadays such datasets are available over time, hence\nthere is a need for (a) treemaps that can handle time-dependent data, and (b)\ncorresponding quality criteria that cover both a treemap's visual quality and\nits stability over time. In recent years a wide variety of (stable) treemapping\nalgorithms has been proposed, with various advantages and limitations. We aim\nto provide insights to researchers and practitioners to allow them to make an\ninformed choice when selecting a treemapping algorithm for specific\napplications and data. To this end, we perform an extensive quantitative\nevaluation of rectangular treemaps for time-dependent data. As part of this\nevaluation we propose a novel classification scheme for time-dependent\ndatasets. Specifically, we observe that the performance of treemapping\nalgorithms depends on the characteristics of the datasets used. We identify\nfour potential representative features that characterize time-dependent\nhierarchical datasets and classify all datasets used in our experiments\naccordingly. We experimentally test the validity of this classification on more\nthan 2000 datasets, and analyze the relative performance of 14 state-of-the-art\nrectangular treemapping algorithms across varying features. Finally, we\nvisually summarize our results with respect to both visual quality and\nstability to aid users in making an informed choice among treemapping\nalgorithms.

In\nmechanical design, a substantial part of B-rep models being used are quadric\nmodels (composed of linear and quadric surfaces). However, push-pulling such\nmodels is not trivial due to the possible smooth face-face connections in the\nmodels. The major issue is that, during push-pull moves, it is often desirable\nto preserve these connections for functional, manufacturing, or aesthetic\nreasons, but this could cause complex inconsistencies between the geometry and\ntopology in the model and lead to robustness issues in updating the model. The\nchallenge lies in effectiveness towards detecting the instants when\ngeometry-topology inconsistencies occur during push-pull moves. This paper\nproposes a novel reverse detection method to solve the challenge and then,\nbased on it, presents a robust method for push-pull direct modeling while\npreserving smooth connections.

In the problem, the input is a graph $G$ with constant degree and a\nset of values for every vertex of $G$. The goal is to preprocess $G$ such that\nwhen given a query value $q$, and a connected subgraph $\\pi$ of $G$, we can\nfind the predecessor of $q$ in all the sets associated with the vertices of\n$\\pi$. The fundamental result of fractional cascading is that there exists a\ndata structure that uses linear space and it can answer queries in $O(\\log n +\n|\\pi|)$ time [Chazelle and Guibas, 1986]. While this technique has received\nplenty of attention in the past decades, an almost quadratic space lower bound\nfor \"2D fractional cascading\" [Chazelle and Liu, 2001] has convinced the\nresearchers that fractional cascading is fundamentally a 1D technique.\n  In 2D fractional cascading, the input includes a planar subdivision for every\nvertex of $G$ and the query is a point $q$ and a subgraph $\\pi$ and the goal is\nto locate the cell containing $q$ in all the subdivisions associated with the\nvertices of $\\pi$. In this paper, we show that it is possible to circumvent the\nlower bound of Chazelle and Liu for axis-aligned planar subdivisions. We\npresent a number of upper and lower bounds which reveal that in 2D, the problem\nhas a much richer structure. When $G$ is a tree and $\\pi$ is a path, then\nqueries can be answered in\n$O(\\log{n}+|\\pi|+\\min\\{|\\pi|\\sqrt{\\log{n}},\\alpha(n)\\sqrt{|\\pi|}\\log{n}\\})$\ntime using linear space where $\\alpha$ is an inverse Ackermann function;\nsurprisingly, we show both branches of this bound are tight, up to the inverse\nAckermann factor. When $G$ is a general graph or when $\\pi$ is a general\nsubgraph, then the query bound becomes $O(\\log n + |\\pi|\\sqrt{\\log n})$ and\nthis bound is once again tight in both cases.\n",

Real-life\nsoftware optimisation however lies in optimising at the same time speed and\nmemory usage as well as keeping code simple. This paper first presents some\nthoughts on the available algorithms in terms of memory usage leading to a very\nsimple scan-line-based algorithm aiming at answering that challenge. Although\nsub-optimal in terms of speed it is optimal if both speed and memory space are\ntaken together and is very easy to implement. For N segments and k\nintersections it uses only N additional integers and lists the intersections in\nO(N^1.26) or corrects them in O((N+k) N^0.26) at most in average, with a high\nprobability of a much lower exponent around 0.16 and even as low as 0.1. It is\ntherefore well adapted for inclusion in larger software and seems like a good\ncompromise. Worst-case is in O(N^2). Then the paper will focus on differences\nbetween available methods and the brute-force algorithm and a solution is\nproposed.

Central to\nthe local analysis is the \"funnel\" which serves as a natural parameter space\nfor the basic surfaces constituting the sweep.

Based\non the complexity of these intersections, we introduce a novel classification\nof sweeps as either decomposable or non-decomposable.

However, bit manipulation is not usually employed in geometric\nalgorithms because the standard model of computation (the real RAM) does not\nsupport it.

Under this framework we show how the use of\na bit representation for the union of triangles, in combination with\nrank-select data structures, allows us to implicitly compute the union of $n$\ntriangles with roughly $O(1)$ bits per union boundary vertex. This results in\nan algorithm that uses at most as much space as the previous one, and depending\non the input, can give a reduction of up to a factor $\\Theta(\\log n)$, while\nmaintaining the running time.\n",

It is defined as the minimal distortion of\nembedding one surface into the other, while the optimal correspondence can be\ndescribed as the map that minimizes this distortion. Solving such a\nminimization is a hard combinatorial problem that requires pre-computation and\nstoring of all pairwise geodesic distances for the matched surfaces. A popular\nway for compact representation of functions on surfaces is by projecting them\ninto the leading eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO). When\ntruncated, The basis of the LBO is known to be the optimal for representing\nfunctions with bounded gradient in a min-max sense. Methods such as\nSpectral-GMDS exploit this idea to simplify and efficiently approximate a\nminimization related to the GH distance by operating in the truncated spectral\ndomain, and obtain state of the art results for matching of nearly isometric\nshapes. However, when considering only a specific set of functions on the\nsurface, such as geodesic distances, an optimized basis could be considered as\nan even better alternative. Here, we define the geodesic distance basis, which\nis optimal for compact approximation of geodesic distances, in terms of\nFrobenius norm. We use the suggested basis to extract the Geodesic Distance\nDescriptor (GDD), which encodes the geodesic distances information as a linear\ncombination of the basis functions. We then show how these ideas can be used to\nefficiently and accurately approximate the metric spaces matching problem with\nalmost no loss of information. These observations are used to construct a very\nsimple and efficient procedure for shape correspondence. Experimental results\nshow that the GDD improves both accuracy and efficiency of state of the art\nshape matching procedures.\n",

We investigate\ntwo fundamental problems under such a stochastic setting, the closest-pair\nproblem and the nearest-neighbor search. For the former, we study the\ncomputation of the $\\ell$-threshold probability and the expectation of the\nclosest-pair distance of a realization of $S$. We propose the first algorithm\nto compute the $\\ell$-threshold probability in $O(t+n\\log n+ \\min\\{tn,n^2\\})$\ntime for any given threshold $\\ell$, which immediately results in an\n$O(t+\\min\\{tn^3,n^4\\})$-time algorithm for computing the expected closest-pair\ndistance.

Greedy drawings\nsupport a simple geometric routing scheme, in which any node that has to send a\npacket to a destination \"greedily\" forwards the packet to any neighbor that is\ncloser to the destination than itself, according to the Euclidean distance in\nthe drawing. In a greedy drawing such a neighbor always exists and hence this\nrouting scheme is guaranteed to succeed.\n  In 2004 Papadimitriou and Ratajczak stated two conjectures related to greedy\ndrawings. The $\\textit{greedy embedding conjecture}$ states that every\n$3$-connected planar graph admits a greedy drawing. The $\\textit{convex greedy\nembedding conjecture}$ asserts that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a\nplanar greedy drawing in which the faces are delimited by convex polygons.

In this paper, we\nprove that Schneiders' pyramid has no hexahedral meshes with fewer than 18\ninterior vertices and 17 hexahedra, and introduce a valid mesh with 44\nhexahedra. We also construct the smallest known mesh of the octagonal spindle,\nwith 40 hexahedra and 42 interior vertices.

The lower bound for Schneiders' pyramid\nis obtained by exhaustively listing the hexahedral meshes with up to 17\ninterior vertices and which have the same boundary as the pyramid. Our\n44-element mesh is obtained by modifying a prior solution with 88 hexahedra.\nThe number of elements was reduced using an algorithm which locally simplifies\ngroups of hexahedra. Given the boundary of such a group, our algorithm is used\nto find a mesh of its interior that has fewer elements than the initial\nsubdivision.

The problem, which\nwe call Stabbing, can be motivated by a resource allocation problem and has\napplications in geometric network design. To the best of our knowledge, only\nspecial cases of this problem have been considered so far.\n  Stabbing is a weighted geometric set cover problem, which we show to be\nNP-hard. A constrained variant of Stabbing turns out to be even APX-hard. While\nfor general set cover the best possible approximation ratio is $\\Theta(\\log\nn)$, it is an important field in geometric approximation algorithms to obtain\nbetter ratios for geometric set cover problems. Chan et al.

We say that two convex bodies $A$ and\n$B$ are equivalent if there exists a linear transformation $B'$ of $B$ such\nthat for any slope, the longest line segments with that slope contained in $A$\nand $B'$, respectively, are equally long. For a broad class of convex bodies,\nincluding all strictly convex bodies and linear transformations of regular\npolygons, we show that the contact graphs of $A$ and $B$ are the same if and\nonly if $A$ and $B$ are equivalent. We prove the same statement for unit\ndistance and intersection graphs.\n",

This problem is referred to as Corridor-MST/Corridor-TSP (CMST/CTSP)\nfor the cases when the guarding walk is a tree/closed walk, respectively. The\ncorresponding decision version of MCG is shown to be NP-Complete[1]. The\nparameterized version of CMST/CTSP referred to as k-CMST/k-CTSP, asks for an\noptimal tree/closed walk on at most k vertices, that visits all the\nline-segments. Here, vertices correspond to the endpoints and intersection\npoints of the input line-segments. We show that k-CMST/k-CTSP is\nfixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the parameter k. Next, we\npropose a variant of CTSP referred to as Minimum Link CTSP(MLC), in which the\nlink-distance of the closed walk has to be minimized. Here, link-distance\nrefers to the number of links or connected line-segments with same orientation\nin the walk. We prove that the decision version of MLC is NP-Complete, and show\nthat the parameterized version, namely b-MLC, is FPT with respect to the\nparameter b, where b corresponds to the link-distance. We also consider another\nrelated problem, the Minimum Corridor Connection (MCC). Given a rectilinear\npolygon partitioned into rectilinear components or rooms, MCC asks for a\nminimum length tree along the edges of the partitions, such that every room is\nincident to at least one vertex of the tree. The decision version of MCC is\nshown to be NP-Complete[2]. We prove the fixed parameter tractability of the\nparameterized version of MCC, namely k-MCC with respect to the parameter k,\nwhere k is the number of rooms.\n",

Starting with the\ncelebrated Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, such reductions have been studied in\ndepth for the Euclidean $(\\ell_2)$ metric, but much less for the Manhattan\n$(\\ell_1)$ metric. Our primary motivation is the approximate nearest neighbor\nproblem in $\\ell_1$. We exploit its reduction to the decision-with-witness\nversion, called approximate \\textit{near} neighbor, which incurs a roughly\nlogarithmic overhead. In 2007, Indyk and Naor, in the context of approximate\nnearest neighbors, introduced the notion of nearest neighbor-preserving\nembeddings. These are randomized embeddings between two metric spaces with\nguaranteed bounded distortion only for the distances between a query point and\na point set. Such embeddings are known to exist for both $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_1$\nmetrics, as well as for doubling subsets of $\\ell_2$. The case that remained\nopen were doubling subsets of $\\ell_1$. In this paper, we propose a dimension\nreduction by means of a \\textit{near} neighbor-preserving embedding for\ndoubling subsets of $\\ell_1$. Our approach is to represent the pointset with a\ncarefully chosen covering set, then randomly project the latter. We study two\ntypes of covering sets: $c$-approximate $r$-nets and randomly shifted grids,\nand we discuss the tradeoff between them in terms of preprocessing time and\ntarget dimension.

The\ncrucial question seems to be the following. {\\em When trying to contain a fire,\nshould one build, at maximum speed, the enclosing barrier, or does it make\nsense to spend some time on placing extra delaying barriers in the fire's way?}\nWe study the situation where the fire must be contained in the upper $L_1$\nhalf-plane by an infinite horizontal barrier to which vertical line segments\nmay be attached as delaying barriers. Surprisingly, such delaying barriers are\nhelpful when properly placed. We prove that speed $v=1.8772$ is sufficient,\nwhile $v >1.66$ is necessary.\n",

As a prerequisite, we propose an in-place construction of the\nclassic data structure the k-d tree, which was originally invented by J. L.\nBentley in 1975. Our in-place variant of the $k$-d tree for a set of n points\nin R^k supports both orthogonal range reporting and counting query using O(1)\nextra workspace, and these query time complexities are the same as the\nclassical complexities, i.e., O(n^{1-1/k}+\\mu) and O(n^{1-1/k}), respectively,\nwhere \\mu is the output size of the reporting query.

One\napproach to overcome this problem is to use the notion of data depth which\nmeasures the centrality of a point with respect to a given data set. In other\nwords, a data depth can be applied to indicate how deep a point is located with\nrespect to a given data set. Using data depth, a multivariate order can be\ndefined by ordering the data points according to their depth values. Various\nnotions of data depth have been introduced over the last decades.

In this paper, we give a robust pipeline for\nhandling those triangulations, based on the computation of a one-to-one\nparametrization for automatically selected patches of input triangles, which\nmakes each patch amenable to remeshing by standard finite element meshing\nalgorithms. Using only geometrical arguments, we prove that a discrete\nparametrization of a patch is one-to-one if (and only if) its image in the\nparameter space is such that all parametric triangles have a positive area. We\nthen derive a non-standard linear discretization scheme based on mean value\ncoordinates to compute such one-to-one parametrizations, and show that the\nscheme does not discretize a Laplacian on a structured mesh. The proposed\npipeline is implemented in the open source mesh generator Gmsh, where the\ncreation of suitable patches is based on triangulation topology and\nparametrization quality, combined with feature edge detection. Several examples\nillustrate the robustness of the resulting implementation.\n",

This construction is called the\ncanonical polygonal schema of the manifold, and is a key ingredient for many\napplications in graphics and engineering, where a parameterization between two\nshapes with same topology is often needed. The sides of the 4g-gon define on\nthe manifold a system of loops, which all intersect at a single point and are\ndisjoint elsewhere. Computing a shortest system of loops of this kind is\nNP-hard. A computationally tractable alternative consists in computing a set of\nshortest loops that are not fully disjoint in polynomial time, using the greedy\nhomotopy basis algorithm proposed by Erickson and Whittlesey, and then detach\nthem in post processing via mesh refinement. Despite this operation is\nconceptually simple, known refinement strategies do not scale well for high\ngenus shapes, triggering a mesh growth that may exceed the amount of memory\navailable in modern computers, leading to failures. In this paper we study\nvarious local refinement operators to detach cycles in a system of loops, and\nshow that there are important differences between them, both in terms of mesh\ncomplexity and preservation of the original surface. We ultimately propose two\nnovel refinement approaches: the former minimizes the number of new elements in\nthe mesh, possibly at the cost of a deviation from the input geometry. The\nlatter allows to trade mesh complexity for geometric accuracy, bounding\ndeviation from the input surface. Both strategies are trivial to implement, and\nexperiments confirm that they allow to realize canonical polygonal schemas even\nfor extremely high genus shapes where previous methods fail.\n",

The idea of partial edge drawings\n(PED) is to drop the middle part of edges and rely on the remaining edge parts\ncalled stubs. We focus on a symmetric model (SPED) that requires the two stubs\nof an edge to be of equal length. In this way, the stub at the other endpoint\nof an edge assures the viewer of the edge's existence. We also consider an\nadditional homogeneity constraint that forces the stub lengths to be a given\nfraction $\\delta$ of the edge lengths ($\\delta$-SHPED). Given length and\ndirection of a stub, this model helps to infer the position of the opposite\nstub.\n  We show that, for a fixed stub--edge length ratio $\\delta$, not all graphs\nhave a $\\delta$-SHPED. Specifically, we show that $K_{241}$ does not have a\n1/4-SHPED, while bandwidth-$k$ graphs always have a $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{k})$-SHPED.\nWe also give bounds for complete bipartite graphs. Further, we consider the\nproblem \\textsc{MaxSPED} where the task is to compute the SPED of maximum total\nstub length that a given straight-line drawing contains.

Formally, given a dataset of $n$ points $P=\\{ x_1,\\ldots, x_n\\}$ in\nhigh-dimensions, and a parameter $k$, the goal is to preprocess the dataset,\nsuch that given a query point $q$, one can compute quickly a point $x \\in P$,\nsuch that the distance of the query to the point $x$ is minimized, when\nignoring the \"optimal\" $k$ coordinates. Note, that the coordinates being\nignored are a function of both the query point and the point returned.\n  We present a general reduction from this problem to answering ANN queries,\nwhich is similar in spirit to LSH (locality sensitive hashing) [IM98].\nSpecifically, we give a sampling technique which achieves a bi-criterion\napproximation for this problem. If the distance to the nearest neighbor after\nignoring $k$ coordinates is $r$, the data-structure returns a point that is\nwithin a distance of $O(r)$ after ignoring $O(k)$ coordinates. We also present\nother applications and further extensions and refinements of the above result.\n  The new data-structures are simple and (arguably) elegant, and should be\npractical -- specifically, all bounds are polynomial in all relevant parameters\n(including the dimension of the space, and the robustness parameter $k$).\n",

In this paper, we study the problem of finding an RVR under the\nassumption that an embedding in the plane of the input graph is fixed and we\nare looking for an RVR that reflects this embedding. We show that in this case\nthe problem can be solved in polynomial time for general embedded graphs and in\nlinear time for 1-plane graphs (i.e., embedded graphs having at most one\ncrossing per edge). The linear time algorithm uses a precise list of forbidden\nconfigurations, which extends the set known for straight-line drawings of\n1-plane graphs. These forbidden configurations can be tested for in linear\ntime, and so in linear time we can test whether a 1-plane graph has an RVR and\neither compute such a representation or report a negative witness. Finally, we\ndiscuss some extensions of our study to the case when the embedding is not\nfixed but the RVR can have at most one crossing per edge.\n",

Also once you have calculated all the prime numbers\nless than n digits, it is very easy to find out if a given number having less\nthan n-digits is or is not a prime. We do this by separating all the primes\nwhich are represented by points in n-dimension space by planes. It so turns out\nthat the number of planes q, required to separate all the points represented by\nprimes less than n-digit, are very few in number. Thus we obtain a very\nefficient storage and retrieval system in n-dimensional space. In addition the\nstorage and retieval repository has the property that when new primes are added\nthere is no need to start all over, we can begin where we last left off and add\nthe new primes in the repository and add new planes that separate them as and\nwhen necessary. Also we can arrange matters such that the repository can begin\nto accept larger primes which has more digits say n' where n' > n. The\nalgorithm does not make use of any property of prime numbers or of integers in\ngeneral,except for the fact that any n-digit integer can be represented as a\npoint in n-dimension space. Therefore the method can serve to be a storage and\nretrieval repository of any set of given integers, in practical cases they can\nrepresent information.

More precisely, we give the first randomized\nEPTAS and deterministic PTAS for Maximum Clique in unit ball graphs. Our\napproximation algorithm also works on disk graphs with arbitrary radii. Almost\nthree decades ago, an elegant polynomial-time algorithm was found for Maximum\nClique on unit disk graphs [Clark, Colbourn, Johnson; Discrete Mathematics\n'90]. Since then, it has been an intriguing open question whether or not\ntractability can be extended to general disk graphs. Recently, it was shown\nthat the disjoint union of two odd cycles is never the complement of a disk\ngraph [Bonnet, Giannopoulos, Kim, Rz\\k{a}\\.{z}ewski, Sikora; SoCG '18]. This\nenabled the authors to derive a QPTAS and a subexponential algorithm for Max\nClique on disk graphs. In this paper, we improve the approximability to a\nrandomized EPTAS (and a deterministic PTAS). More precisely, we obtain a\nrandomized EPTAS for computing the independence number on graphs having no\ndisjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph, bounded VC-dimension,\nand large independence number. We then address the question of computing Max\nClique for disks in higher dimensions. We show that intersection graphs of unit\nballs, like disk graphs, do not admit the complement of two odd cycles as an\ninduced subgraph. This, in combination with the first result, straightforwardly\nyields a randomized EPTAS for Max Clique on unit ball graphs. In stark\ncontrast, we show that on ball and unit 4-dimensional disk graphs, Max Clique\nis NP-hard and does not admit an approximation scheme even in\nsubexponential-time, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.\n",

The huge\ninitial dimension of the 2D flattened structure makes fabrication difficult,\nand defeats the main purpose, namely compactness, of many origami-inspired\nengineering. In this work, we propose a novel algorithmic kirigami method that\nprovides super compaction of an arbitrary 3D shape with non-negligible surface\nthickness called \"algorithmic stacking\". Our approach computationally finds a\nway of cutting the thick surface of the shape into a strip. This strip forms a\nHamiltonian cycle that covers the entire surface and can realize transformation\nbetween two target shapes: from a super compact stacked shape to the input 3D\nshape. Depending on the surface thickness, the stacked structure takes merely\n0.001% to 6% of the original volume. This super compacted structure not only\ncan be manufactured in a workspace that is significantly smaller than the\nprovided 3D shape, but also makes packing and transportation easier for a\ndeployable application. We further demonstrate that, the proposed stackable\nstructure also provides high pluripotency and can transform into multiple 3D\ntarget shapes if these 3D shapes can be dissected in specific ways and form a\ncommon stacked structure. In contrast to many designs of origami structure that\nusually target at a particular shape, our results provide a universal platform\nfor pluripotent 3D transformable structures.\n",

We\nintroduce the concept of a Voronoi-like diagram, a relaxed version of an\nabstract Voronoi construct that has a structure similar to an ordinary Voronoi\ndiagram, without, however, being one. We formalize the concept, and prove that\nit is robust under insertion, therefore, enabling its use in incremental\nconstructions. The time-complexity analysis of the resulting simple randomized\nincremental construction is non-standard, and interesting in its own right,\nbecause the intermediate Voronoi-like structures are order-dependent. We\nfurther extend the approach to compute the following structures in expected\nlinear time: the order-(k+1) subdivision within an order-k Voronoi region, and\nthe farthest abstract Voronoi diagram after the order of its regions at\ninfinity is known.\n",

Crossing minimization in\ncircular layouts is \\NP-hard. One way to allow for fewer crossings in practice\nare two-sided layouts that draw some edges as curves in the exterior of the\ncircle. In fact, one- and two-sided circular layouts are equivalent to one-page\nand two-page book drawings, i.e., graph layouts with all vertices placed on a\nline (the spine) and edges drawn in one or two distinct half-planes (the pages)\nbounded by the spine. In this paper we study the problem of minimizing the\ncrossings for a fixed cyclic vertex order by computing an optimal $k$-plane set\nof exteriorly drawn edges for $k \\ge 1$, extending the previously studied case\n$k=0$. We show that this relates to finding bounded-degree maximum-weight\ninduced subgraphs of circle graphs, which is a graph-theoretic problem of\nindependent interest. We show \\NP-hardness for arbitrary $k$, present an\nefficient algorithm for $k=1$, and generalize it to an explicit \\XP-time\nalgorithm for any fixed $k$. For the practically interesting case $k=1$ we\nimplemented our algorithm and present experimental results that confirm the\napplicability of our algorithm.\n",

A beacon is a fixed point with\nan attraction pull that can move points within a given polygon. Points move\ngreedily towards a beacon: if unobstructed, they move along a straight line to\nthe beacon, and otherwise they slide on the edges of the polygon. The Euclidean\ndistance from a moving point to a beacon is monotonically decreasing. A given\nbeacon attracts a point if the point eventually reaches the beacon.\n  The problem of attracting all points within a polygon with a set of beacons\ncan be viewed as a variation of the art gallery problem. Unlike most\nvariations, the beacon attraction has the intriguing property of being\nasymmetric, leading to separate definitions of attraction region and inverse\nattraction region. The attraction region of a beacon is the set of points that\nit attracts. It is connected and can be computed in linear time for simple\npolygons. By contrast, it is known that the inverse attraction region of a\npoint---the set of beacon positions that attract it---could have $\\Omega(n)$\ndisjoint connected components.\n  In this paper, we prove that, in spite of this, the total complexity of the\ninverse attraction region of a point in a simple polygon is linear, and present\na $O(n \\log n)$ time algorithm to construct it. This improves upon the best\nprevious algorithm which required $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space. Furthermore\nwe prove a matching $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ lower bound for this task in the\nalgebraic computation tree model of computation, even if the polygon is\nmonotone.\n",

In this case, computing\nthe $\\beta$-skeleton depth is based on counting all of the $\\beta$-skeleton\ninfluence regions, obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The\n$\\beta$-skeleton depth introduces a family of depth functions that contains\n\\emph{spherical depth} and \\emph{lens depth} for $\\beta=1$ and $\\beta=2$,\nrespectively. The straightforward algorithm for computing the $\\beta$-skeleton\ndepth in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. This complexity of computation is a\nsignificant advantage of using the $\\beta$-skeleton depth in multivariate data\nanalysis because unlike most other data depths, the time complexity of the\n$\\beta$-skeleton depth grows linearly rather than exponentially in the\ndimension $d$. The main results of this paper include two algorithms.

As such, we also obtain a\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the problem with \"diagonal-anchored\" L-frames.\nOn the other hand, we show that the problem is APX-hard in case the input\nL-frames intersect the diagonal, or the horizontal segments of the L-frames\nintersect a vertical line.

Within this\npaper we give an alternative interpretation for the points of $P^5$ as lines of\nan Euclidean 4-space $E^4$, which are orthogonal to a fixed direction. By using\nthe quaternionic notation for lines, we study straight lines in $P^5$ which\ncorrespond in the general case to cubic 2-surfaces in $E^4$. We show that these\nsurfaces are geometrically connected with circular Darboux 2-motions in $E^4$,\nas they are basic surfaces of the underlying line-symmetric motions. Moreover\nwe extend the obtained results to line-elements of the Euclidean 3-space $E^3$,\nwhich can be represented as points of a cone over $\\Psi$ sliced along the\n2-dimensional generator space of ideal lines. We also study straight lines of\nits ambient space $P^6$ and show that they correspond to ruled surface strips\ncomposed of the mentioned 2-surfaces with circles on it. Finally we present an\napplication of this interpretation in the context of interactive design of\nruled surfaces and ruled surface strips/patches based on the algorithm of De\nCasteljau.\n",

We examine the scenario when the connecting lines\n(leaders) are drawn as axis-aligned polylines with few bends, every leader lies\nstrictly inside $R$, no two leaders cross, and the sum of the lengths of all\nthe leaders is minimized. In a $k$-sided boundary labeling problem, where $1\\le\nk\\le 4$, the label locations are located on the $k$ consecutive sides of $R$.\n  In this paper, we develop an $O(n^3\\log n)$-time algorithm for 2-sided\nboundary labeling, where the leaders are restricted to have one bend. This\nimproves the previously best known $O(n^8\\log n)$-time algorithm of Kindermann\net al. (Algorithmica, 76(1):225-258, 2016). We show the problem is\npolynomial-time solvable in more general settings such as when the ports are\nlocated on more than two sides of $R$, in the presence of obstacles, and even\nwhen the objective is to minimize the total number of bends. Our results\nimprove the previous algorithms on boundary labeling with obstacles, as well as\nprovide the first polynomial-time algorithms for minimizing the total leader\nlength and number of bends for 3- and 4-sided boundary labeling.

This\nputs a major roadblock to computing persistence and a homology basis\n(generators) for complexes embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and beyond in less than\nquadratic or even near-quadratic time. But, what about dimension three? It is\nknown that persistence for piecewise linear functions on a complex $K$ with $n$\nsimplices can be computed in $O(n\\log n)$ time and a set of generators of total\nsize $k$ can be computed in $O(n+k)$ time when $K$ is a graph or a surface\nlinearly embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

It occurs when groups of relatively simple components\nspontaneously combine to form more complex structures. While such systems have\ninspired a large amount of research into designing theoretical models of\nself-assembling systems, and even laboratory-based implementations of them,\nthese artificial models and systems often tend to be lacking in one of the\npowerful features of natural systems (e.g. the assembly and folding of\nproteins), namely the dynamic reconfigurability of structures. In this paper,\nwe present a new mathematical model of self-assembly, based on the abstract\nTile Assembly Model (aTAM), called the Flexible Tile Assembly Model (FTAM). In\nthe FTAM, the individual components are 2-dimensional square tiles as in the\naTAM, but in the FTAM, bonds between the edges of tiles can be flexible,\nallowing bonds to flex and entire structures to reconfigure, thus allowing\n2-dimensional components to form 3-dimensional structures. We analyze the\npowers and limitations of FTAM systems by (1) demonstrating how flexibility can\nbe controlled to carefully build desired structures, and (2) showing how\nflexibility can be beneficially harnessed to form structures which can\n\"efficiently\" reconfigure into many different configurations and/or greatly\nvarying configurations. We also show that with such power comes a heavy burden\nin terms of computational complexity of simulation and prediction by proving\nthat, for important properties of FTAM systems, determining their existence is\nintractable, even for properties which are easily computed for systems in less\ndynamic models.\n",

Thus last year the authors introduced the\nMetric Violation Distance (MVD) problem, where the input is an undirected and\npositively-weighted complete graph, and the goal is to identify a minimum\ncardinality subset of edges whose weights can be modified such that the\nresulting graph is its own metric completion. This problem was shown to be\nAPX-hard, and moreover an $O(OPT^{1/3})$-approximation was shown, where $OPT$\nis the size of the optimal solution.\n  In this paper we introduce the Generalized Metric Violation Distance (GMVD)\nproblem, where the goal is the same, but the input graph is no longer required\nto be complete. For GMVD we prove stronger hardness results, and provide a\nsignificantly faster approximation algorithm with an improved approximation\nguarantee. In particular, we give an approximation-preserving reduction from\nthe well studied MultiCut problem, which is hard to approximate within any\nconstant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Our approximation factor\ndepends on deficit values, which for a given cycle is the largest single edge\nweight minus the sum of the weights of all its other edges.

We present an $O(t \\log n)$ time, $O(t)$\nspace preprocessing, $O((n / \\sqrt{t}) \\log ^{7/2} n)$ query time solution for\nthis problem, for any $n ^{1 + \\epsilon} \\leq t \\leq n^{2}$. For a path with\n$k$ segments, this results in $O((n k / \\sqrt{t}) \\log ^{7/2} n)$ query time,\nwhich is a significant improvement over algorithms that can be derived from\nexisting computational geometry methods when $k$ is small.\n",

A natural\ngeneralization of the RCP problem is the {colored range closest-pair} (CRCP)\nproblem in which the given data points are colored and the goal is to find the\nclosest {bichromatic} pair contained in the query range.

We first study\nthe scenario in which viewers can be all points of the polygon (such as a\nmobile robot which moves in the interior of the polygon).

Then we give an upper bound of O(log^2 n) colours on\nn-vertex weak visibility polygons, by decomposing the problem into sub-funnels.\nThis bound generalises to all simple polygons. We briefly look also at the\nsecond scenario, in which the viewers are only the vertices of the polygon. We\nshow a lower bound of 3 colours in the general case of simple polygons and\nconjecture that this is tight.

This algorithm is the first practical solution to the problem. It is\nable to compute small hexahedral meshes of quadrangulations for which the\npreviously known best solutions could only be built by hand or contained\nthousands of hexahedra. These challenging quadrangulations include the\nboundaries of transition templates that are critical for the success of general\nhexahedral meshing algorithms.\n  The algorithm proposed in this paper is dedicated to building combinatorial\nhexahedral meshes of small quadrangulations and ignores the geometrical\nproblem. The key idea of the method is to exploit the equivalence between quad\nflips in the boundary and the insertion of hexahedra glued to this boundary.\nThe tree of all sequences of flipping operations is explored, searching for a\npath that transforms the input quadrangulation Q into a new quadrangulation for\nwhich a hexahedral mesh is known. When a small hexahedral mesh exists, a\nsequence transforming Q into the boundary of a cube is found; otherwise, a set\nof pre-computed hexahedral meshes is used.\n  A novel approach to deal with the large number of problem symmetries is\nproposed. Combined with an efficient backtracking search, it allows small\nshellable hexahedral meshes to be found for all even quadrangulations with up\nto 20 quadrangles. All 54,943 such quadrangulations were meshed using no more\nthan 72 hexahedra. This algorithm is also used to find a construction to fill\narbitrary domains, thereby proving that any ball-shaped domain bounded by n\nquadrangles can be meshed with no more than 78 n hexahedra. This very\nsignificantly lowers the previous upper bound of 5396 n.\n",

Several new algorithmic\nresults are also obtained: a largest empty square among $P$ and a square\nannulus of minimum width or minimum area that encloses $P$ over all\norientations can be computed in worst-case $O(n^2 \\log n)$ time.\n",

Since for given start and target configurations,\nreconfiguration may be impossible, we translate the entire target configuration\nrigidly into a location that admits a valid sequence of moves, where each\nobject moves in turn just once, along a straight line, from its starting to its\ntarget location, so that the overall physical space required by the start, all\nintermediate, and target configurations for all the objects is minimized.\n  We investigate two variants of space-aware reconfiguration for the often\nexamined setting of $n$ unit discs in the plane, depending on whether the discs\nare distinguishable (labeled) or indistinguishable (unlabeled). For the labeled\ncase, we propose a representation of size $O(n^4)$ of the space of all feasible\ninitial rigid translations, and use it to find, in $O(n^6)$ time, a shortest\nvalid translation, or one that minimizes the enclosing disc or axis-aligned\nrectangle of both the start and target configurations.

When the ranges are composed of simplices, the problem can\nbe solved using $S(n)$ space and with $Q(n)$ query time with $S(n)Q^d(n) =\n\\tilde{O}(n^d)$ and this trade-off is almost tight.

It has been conjectured that the same could be done for\nthe fast query case but this open problem has stayed unresolved.\n  Here, we disprove this conjecture. We give the first nontrivial lower bounds\nfor semilagebraic range searching and related problems. We show that any data\nstructure for reporting the points between two concentric circles with $Q(n)$\nquery time must use $S(n)=\\Omega(n^{3-o(1)}/Q(n)^5)$ space, meaning, for\n$Q(n)=O(\\log^{O(1)}n)$, $\\Omega(n^{3-o(1)})$ space must be used.

We improve the existing\n$O((\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^3})^{\\frac 4 3}\\polylog \\frac n \\epsilon)$ time\n$(6+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm by providing a\n$(4+\\epsilon)$-approximation $O(n(\\log^2 n)(\\log^2\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})+\\frac{n}{\\epsilon})$ time algorithm, and the existing\n$O(n^2)$ time $2$-approximation algorithm improving the existing $O(n^2\\log n)$\ntime $2$-approximation algorithm.\n  Our exact $c$-packedness algorithm takes $O(n^5)$ time, which is the first\nexact algorithm for disks. We show using $\\alpha$-fat shapes instead of disks\nadds a factor $\\alpha^2$ to the approximation.\n  We also give a data-structure for computing the curve-length inside query\ndisks. It has $O(n^6\\log n)$ construction time, uses $O(n^6)$ space, and has\nquery time $O(\\log n+k)$, where $k$ is the number of intersected segments with\nthe query shape.

Trajectories provide detailed views on specific routes, but\ntypically do not capture all traffic. Loop detectors capture all traffic flow\nat specific locations instead, but provide no information on individual routes.\nGiven a set of loop-detector measurements and a set of representative\ntrajectories, our goal is to investigate how one can effectively combine these\ntwo partial data sources to create a more complete picture of the underlying\nmobility. Specifically, we want to reconstruct a realistic set of routes from\nthe loop-detector data, using the given trajectories as representatives of\ntypical behavior.\n  We model loop-detector data as a network flow that needs to be covered by the\nreconstructed routes and we capture realism of the routes via the Fr\\'echet\ndistance to the representatives. We prove that several forms of the resulting\nproblem are NP-hard. Hence we explore heuristics that decompose the flow well\nwhile following the representatives to varying degrees. First we propose the\nFr\\'echet Routes (FR) heuristic which generates candidates routes with bounded\nFr\\'echet distance. Second we describe a variant of multi-commodity min-cost\nflow (MCMCF) which is loosely coupled to the trajectories. Lastly we consider\nglobal min-cost flow (GMCF) which is essentially agnostic to the\nrepresentatives.\n  We evaluate these approaches on synthetic and real-world trajectory data with\na map-matched ground truth. We find that GMCF explains the flow best, but\nproduces a large number of routes (significantly more than the ground truth);\nthese routes are often nonsensical. MCMCF produces a large number of mostly\nrealistic routes which explain the flow reasonably well. In contrast, FR\nproduces significantly smaller sets of realistic routes that still explain the\nflow well, albeit with a higher running time.\n",

In practice, a map between two shapes is commonly\nrepresented by two meshes with same connectivity and different embedding. The\nstandard approach is to input a meshing of one of the two domains plus a\nfunction that projects its boundary to the other domain, and then solve for the\nposition of the interior vertices. Inspired by basic principles in mesh\ngeneration, in this paper we present the reader a novel point of view on mesh\nparameterization: we consider connectivity as an additional unknown, and assume\nthat our inputs are just two boundaries that enclose the domains we want to\nconnect. We compute the map by simultaneously growing the same mesh inside both\nshapes.This change in perspective allows us to recast the parameterization\nproblem as a mesh generation problem, granting access to a wide set of mature\ntools that are typically not used in this setting. Our practical outcome is a\nprovably robust yet trivial to implement algorithm that maps any planar shape\nwith simple topology to a homotopic domain that is weakly visible from an inner\nconvex kernel. Furthermore, we speculate on a possible extension of the\nproposed ideas to volumetric maps, listing the major challenges that arise.\nDifferently from prior methods, for which we show that a volumetric extension\nis not possible, our analysis leaves us reasoneable hopes that the robust\ngeneration of volumetric maps via compatible mesh generation could be obtained\nin the future.\n",

Since crystal structures are determined in a\nrigid form, their finest natural equivalence is defined by rigid motion or\nisometry, which preserves inter-point distances. Due to atomic vibrations,\nisometry classes of periodic point sets form a continuous space whose geometry\nand topology were unknown. The key new problem in Periodic Geometry is to\nunambiguously parameterize this space of isometry classes by continuous\ncoordinates that allow a complete reconstruction of any crystal. The major part\nof this manuscript reviews the recently developed isometry invariants to\nresolve the above problem: (1) density functions computed from higher order\nVoronoi zones, (2) distance-based invariants that allow ultra-fast\nvisualizations of huge crystal datasets, and (3) the complete invariant isoset\n(a DNA-type code) with a first continuous metric on all periodic crystals. The\nmain goal of Periodic Topology is to classify textiles up to periodic isotopy,\nwhich is a continuous deformation of a thickened plane without a fixed lattice\nbasis. This practical problem substantially differs from past research focused\non links in a fixed thickened torus.\n",

Given one or\nmore trajectories, the task is to split the trajectories into several parts,\nsuch that the parts have a good clustering structure. We approach this problem\nvia a new set cover formulation, which we think provides a natural\nformalization of the problem as it is studied in many applications. Given a\npolygonal curve $P$ with $n$ vertices in fixed dimension, integers $k$, $\\ell\n\\geq 1$, and a real value $\\Delta > 0$, the goal is to find $k$ center curves\nof complexity at most $\\ell$ such that every point on $P$ is covered by a\nsubtrajectory that has small Fr\\'echet distance to one of the $k$ center curves\n($\\leq \\Delta$). In many application scenarios, one is interested in finding\nclusters of small complexity, which is controlled by the parameter $\\ell$. Our\nmain result is a bicriterial approximation algorithm: if there exists a\nsolution for given parameters $k$, $\\ell$, and $\\Delta$, then our algorithm\nfinds a set of $k'$ center curves of complexity at most $\\ell$ with covering\nradius $\\Delta'$ with $k' \\in O( k \\ell^2 \\log (k \\ell))$, and $\\Delta'\\leq 19\n\\Delta$. Moreover, within these approximation bounds, we can minimize $k$ while\nkeeping the other parameters fixed. If $\\ell$ is a constant independent of $n$,\nthen, the approximation factor for the number of clusters $k$ is $O(\\log k)$\nand the approximation factor for the radius $\\Delta$ is constant.

In the\nfree-form design of discrete architectural surfaces, the Gaussian curvature\nplays an important role not only aesthetically but also in terms of stiffness\nand constructability. However, designing a surface manually with specific\nGaussian curvatures can be a time-consuming task. We propose a method to find a\ntriangulated surface with user-specified Gaussian curvatures (not limited to\nconstant Gaussian curvatures) and boundary vertex positions. In addition, the\nconformal class of the final design can be specified; that is, the user has\ncontrol over the shape (the corner angles) of each triangular panel. The panels\ncould be encouraged to form a regular tessellation or kept close to those of\nthe initial design. The controllability of the conformal class suppresses\npossible distortion of the panels, resulting in higher structural performance\nand aesthetics. Our method relies on the idea in computational conformal\ngeometry called circle packing. In this line of research, the discrete Ricci\nflow has been widely used for surface modelling. However, it is not trivial to\nincorporate constraints such as boundary locations and convexity of the spanned\nsurface, which are essential to architectural applications. We propose a\nperturbation of the discrete Ricci energy and develop a least-squares-based\noptimisation scheme to address these problems with an open-source\nimplementation available online.\n",

Specifically, if the $n$ corresponding points of a\nweighted unit-disk graph $G$ are picked from a unit square uniformly at random,\nand the connectivity radius is $r\\in (0,1)$, $A^*$ finds a shortest path in $G$\nin $O(n)$ expected time when $r=\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n/n})$, even though $G$ has\n$\\Theta((nr)^2)$ edges in expectation. In other words, the work done by the\nalgorithm is in expectation proportional to the number of vertices and not the\nnumber of edges.\n  In this paper, we break this natural barrier and show even stronger sublinear\ntime results. We propose a new heuristic approach to computing point-to-point\nexact shortest paths in unit-disk graphs. We analyze the average-case behavior\nof our heuristic using the same random graph model as used by Sedgewick and\nVitter and prove it superior to $A^*$.

(1983), for any hypercube.\n  Our results have implications on the maximum density of graphs describing\npolyhedral surfaces with convex cells: The realizability of hypercubes shows\nthat the maximum number of edges over all realizable $n$-vertex graphs is in\n$\\Omega(n \\log n)$. From the non-realizability of $K_{5,81}$, we obtain that\nany realizable $n$-vertex graph has $O(n^{9/5})$ edges. As such, these graphs\ncan be considerably denser than planar graphs, but not arbitrarily dense.\n",

The puppy runs with unbounded\nspeed along the curve as long as the Euclidean straight-line distance to the\nhuman is decreasing, so that it is always at a point on the curve where the\ndistance is locally minimal.

It enables a compact vibration damping method\nwithout adding significant mass and volumetric occupancy. Analyzing the\ndynamics of such electromechanical systems requires precise modeling tools that\nproperly consider the coupling between the piezoelectric elements and the host\nstructure. Although the concept of shunt damping has been studied extensively\nin the literature, most of the studies do not provide a formulation for\nmodeling the multiple piezoelectric patches that are scattered on the host\nstructure and shunted separately. This paper presents a methodology and a\nformulation for separately shunted piezoelectric patches for achieving higher\nperformance on vibration attenuation. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is used for\nperforming modal analysis and obtaining the frequency response functions of the\nelectro-mechanical system. The developed model includes mass and stiffness\ncontribution of the piezoelectric patches as well as the electromechanical\ncoupling effect. In this study, the piezoelectric patches are shunted via\nseparate electrical circuits and compared with the ones those are shunted via\ninterconnected electrical circuits. For verification, system-level finite\nelement simulations are performed in ANSYS software and compared with the\nanalytical model results. An experimental setup is also built to validate the\nperformance of the separately shunted piezoelectric patches. The effectiveness\nof the method is investigated for a broader range of frequencies and it was\nshown that separately shunted piezoelectric patches are more effective compared\nto connected for a wide range of frequencies.\n",

Later, stability properties of\nmultidimensional persistence have been proved to hold when topological spaces\nare filtered by continuous functions, i.e. for continuous data. This paper aims\nto provide a bridge between the continuous setting, where stability properties\nhold, and the discrete setting, where actual computations are carried out. More\nprecisely, a stability preserving method is developed to compare rank\ninvariants of vector functions obtained from discrete data. These advances\nconfirm that multidimensional persistent homology is an appropriate tool for\nshape comparison in computer vision and computer graphics applications. The\nresults are supported by numerical tests.\n",

The puzzle has been popularized of late by\nPeter Winkler \\cite{Winkler2007}. Let $P_{n}$ be a set of $n$ points, including\nthe origin, in the unit square $U = [0,1]^2$.

We would term the above\nrectangles as \\emph{anchored rectangles}. The longstanding conjecture has been\nthat at least half of $U$ can be covered when anchored rectangles are properly\nplaced.

We contribute two\nnew results to this field. First, we fully characterize when an environment\nwith a single obstacles is one-pursuer-win or two-pursuer-win.

A hyperplane $\\Hy$ is an \\emph{$m$-separator} for\n$\\D$ if each closed halfspace bounded by $\\Hy$ contains at least $m$ points\nfrom $P$. This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond\nto $n/2$-separators. The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied.\nSeparators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer\nschemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating\nhyperplane may still interact with both sides of the partition. Therefore it is\ndesirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls\nonly.

In this\npaper, we present such a straightforward and efficient preprocessing approach\nby exploiting the GPU. The basic idea behind our approach is to discard the\npoints that locate inside a convex polygon formed by 16 extreme points. Due to\nthe fact that the extreme points of a point set do not alter when all points\nare rotated in the same angle, four groups of extreme points with min or max x\nor y coordinates can be found in the original point set and three rotated point\nsets. These 16 extreme points are then used to form a convex polygon. We check\nall input points and discard the points that locate inside the convex polygon.\nWe use the remaining points to calculate the expected convex hull. Experimental\nresults show that: when employing the proposed preprocessing algorithm, it\nachieves the speedups of about 4x ~5x on average and 5x ~ 6x in the best cases\nover the cases where the proposed approach is not used.

The same bound holds for $n$ intersecting line segments,\nwhen $k\\geq n/2$.

Furthermore, we enhance the iterative\napproach to construct this diagram. All bounds are valid in the general $L_p$\nmetric, $1\\leq p\\leq \\infty$.

The difference is in the way edges are selected. Yao-Yao\ngraphs select an edge of minimum length, whereas Theta-Theta graphs select an\nedge of minimum orthogonal projection onto the cone bisector. It has been\nestablished that the Yao-Yao graphs with parameter k = 6k' have spanning ratio\n11.67, for k' >= 6.

It asks for the minimum number of guards required to\nachieve visibility coverage of a given polygon. The AGP is well-known to be\nNP-hard even in restricted cases. In this paper, we consider the Art Gallery\nProblem with Fading (AGPF): A polygonal region is to be illuminated with light\nsources such that every point is illuminated with at least a global threshold,\nlight intensity decreases over distance, and we seek to minimize the total\nenergy consumption. Choosing fading exponents of zero, one, and two are\nequivalent to the AGP, laser scanner applications, and natural light,\nrespectively. We present complexity results as well as a negative solvability\nresult. Still, we propose two practical algorithms for AGPF with fixed light\npositions (e.g. vertex guards) independent of the fading exponent, which we\ndemonstrate to work well in practice. One is based on a discrete approximation,\nthe other on non-linear programming by means of simplex-partitioning\nstrategies. The former approach yields a fully polynomial-time approximation\nscheme for AGPF with fixed light positions. The latter approach obtains better\nresults in our experimental evaluation.\n",

In 1994, Bronniman and Goodrich\nmade an important connection of this problem to the size of fundamental\ncombinatorial structures called $\\epsilon$-nets, showing that small-sized\n$\\epsilon$-nets imply approximation algorithms with correspondingly small\napproximation ratios. Very recently, Agarwal and Pan showed that their scheme\ncan be implemented in near-linear time for disks in the plane. Altogether this\ngives $O(1)$-factor approximation algorithms in $\\tilde{O}(n)$ time for hitting\nsets for disks in the plane.\n  This constant factor depends on the sizes of $\\epsilon$-nets for disks;\nunfortunately, the current state-of-the-art bounds are large -- at least\n$24/\\epsilon$ and most likely larger than $40/\\epsilon$. Thus the approximation\nfactor of the Agarwal and Pan algorithm ends up being more than $40$. The best\nlower-bound is $2/\\epsilon$, which follows from the Pach-Woeginger construction\nfor halfspaces in two dimensions. Thus there is a large gap between the\nbest-known upper and lower bounds. Besides being of independent interest,\nfinding precise bounds is important since this immediately implies an improved\nlinear-time algorithm for the hitting-set problem.\n  The main goal of this paper is to improve the upper-bound to $13.4/\\epsilon$\nfor disks in the plane. The proof is constructive, giving a simple algorithm\nthat uses only Delaunay triangulations. We have implemented the algorithm,\nwhich is available as a public open-source module. Experimental results show\nthat the sizes of $\\epsilon$-nets for a variety of data-sets is lower, around\n$9/\\epsilon$.\n",

When cutting away a region from a solid piece\nof material -- such as steel, wood, ceramics, or plastic -- using a rough tool\nin a milling machine, sharp convex corners of the region cannot be done\nproperly, but have to be left for finer tools that are more expensive to use.\nWe want to determine a toolpath that maximizes the use of the rough tool. In\norder to formulate the problem in mathematical terms, we introduce the notion\nof bounded convex curvature. A region of points in the plane $Q$ has\n\\emph{bounded convex curvature} if for any point $x\\in\\partial Q$, there is a\nunit disk $U$ and $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $x\\in \\partial U$ and all points in\n$U$ within distance $\\varepsilon$ from $x$ are in $Q$.

For the second problem, for a given set of points\nand objects {in a plane}, the objective is to choose {a} minimum number of\nobjects to cover all the points.

This drawing style is\nmotivated by greedy geometric routing in wireless sensor networks.\n  A Christmas cactus is a connected graph in which every two simple cycles have\nat most one vertex in common and in which every cutvertex is part of at most\ntwo biconnected blocks. It has been proved that Christmas cactus graphs have an\nEuclidean greedy embedding. This fact has played a crucial role in proving that\nevery 3-connected planar graph has an Euclidean greedy embedding. The proofs\nconstruct greedy embeddings of Christmas cactuses of exponential size, and it\nhas been an open question whether exponential area is necessary in the worst\ncase for greedy embeddings of Christmas cactuses. We prove that this is indeed\nthe case.\n",

This incredibly challenging problem has been studied for\nmore than four decades and has been only recently shown to be NP-Hard. In this\npaper we present a novel polynomial-time algorithm that computes a\n$14$-approximation of the minimum weight triangulation -- a constant that is\nsignificantly smaller than what has been previously known.\n  In our algorithm, we use grids to partition the edges into levels where\nshorter edges appear at smaller levels and edges with similar lengths appear at\nthe same level. We then triangulate the point set incrementally by introducing\nedges in increasing order of their levels. We introduce the edges of any level\n$i+1$ in two steps. In the first step, we add edges using a variant of the\nwell-known ring heuristic to generate a partial triangulation\n$\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$. In the second step, we greedily add non-intersecting\nlevel $i+1$ edges to $\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$ in increasing order of their length\nand obtain a partial triangulation $\\mathcal{A}_{ i+1}$. The ring heuristic is\nknown to yield only an $O(\\log n)$-approximation even for a convex polygon and\nthe greedy heuristic achieves only a $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$-approximation.\nTherefore, it is surprising that their combination leads to an improved\napproximation ratio of $14$.\n  For the proof, we identify several useful properties of $\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$\nand combine it with a new Euler characteristic based technique to show that\n$\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$ has more edges than $\\mathcal{T}_i$; here $\\mathcal{T}_i$\nis the partial triangulation consisting of level $\\le i$ edges of some minimum\nweight triangulation.

To address this problem we study distortion of the\nprobabilistic embedding that results from projecting the curves to a randomly\nchosen line. Such an embedding could be used in combination with, e.g.\nlocality-sensitive hashing. We show that in the worst case and under reasonable\nassumptions, the discrete Fr\\'echet distance between two polygonal curves of\ncomplexity $t$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d\\in\\lbrace 2,3,4,5\\rbrace$, degrades\nby a factor linear in $t$ with constant probability. We show upper and lower\nbounds on the distortion. We also evaluate our findings empirically on a\nbenchmark data set. The preliminary experimental results stand in stark\ncontrast with our lower bounds. They indicate that highly distorted projections\nhappen very rarely in practice, and only for strongly conditioned input curves.\n  Keywords: Fr\\'echet distance, metric embeddings, random projections\n",

The basic idea is to\nadd objects in a random order and show that this approach yields\nefficient/optimal bounds on {\\bf expected} running time. Even quicksort can be\nviewed as a special case of this paradigm. However, unlike quicksort, for most\nof these problems, attempts to obtain sharper tail estimates on the running\ntime had proved inconclusive. Barring some results by\n\\cite{MSW93,CMS92,Seidel91a}, the general question remains unresolved.\n  In this paper we present some general techniques to obtain tail estimates for\n  RIC and and provide applications to some fundamental problems like Delaunay\ntriangulations and construction of Visibility maps of intersecting line\nsegments. The main result of the paper centers around a new and careful\napplication of Freedman's \\cite{Fre75} inequality for Martingale concentration\nthat overcomes the bottleneck of the better known Azuma-Hoeffding inequality.\nFurther, we show instances where an RIC based algorithm may not have inverse\npolynomial tail estimates. In particular, we show that the RIC time bounds for\ntrapezoidal map can encounter a running time of $\\Omega (n\\log n\\log\\log n )$\nwith probability exceeding $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.

Questions of this type have been studied in the past, with\ncomplexity and approximation results as well as open problems dating back to\nwork by Arkin et al. in 2001. A wide spectrum of practical applications have\nrenewed the interest in these questions, and spawned variants: for full\ncoverage, every point has to be covered, for subset coverage, specific points\nhave to be covered, and for penalty coverage, points may be left uncovered by\nincurring an individual penalty.\n  We make a number of contributions. We first show that finding a minimum-turn\n(full) cycle cover is NP-hard even in 2-dimensional grid graphs, solving the\nlong-standing open Problem 53 in The Open Problems Project edited by Demaine,\nMitchell and O'Rourke. We also prove NP-hardness of finding a subset cycle\ncover of minimum turn cost in thin grid graphs, for which Arkin et al. gave a\npolynomial-time algorithm for full coverage; this shows that their boundary\ntechniques cannot be applied to compute exact solutions for subset and penalty\nvariants.\n  On the positive side, we establish the first constant-factor approximation\nalgorithms for all considered subset and penalty problem variants, making use\nof LP/IP techniques. For full coverage in more general grid graphs (e.g.,\nhexagonal grids), our approximation factors are better than the combinatorial\nones of Arkin et al.

Such models can be found at the core of many\ncomputer vision applications such as face reconstruction, recognition and\nauthentication to name just a few.\n  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great promise in imitating\nhigh dimensional data distributions.

This alignment process allows for efficient processing of\ndigitally scanned geometric data via image processing tools.\n  Using this methodology, we propose a novel face synthesis model for\ngeneration of realistic facial textures together with their corresponding\ngeometry.

This is similar to\ncharacterizations for other classes of bipartite intersection graphs.\n  We present an algorithm to test whether given orderings of $A$ and $B$ permit\na Stick representation respecting those orderings, and to find such a\nrepresentation if it exists. The algorithm runs in time linear in the size of\nthe adjacency matrix. For the case when only the ordering of $A$ is given, we\npresent an $O(|A|^3|B|^3)$-time algorithm.

        "summary": "  Given a set of $n$ disks of radius $R$ in the Euclidean plane, the Traveling\nSalesman Problem With Neighborhoods (TSPN) on uniform disks asks for the\nshortest tour that visits all of the disks. The problem is a generalization of\nthe classical Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) on points and has been widely\nstudied in the literature. For the case of disjoint uniform disks of radius\n$R$, Dumitrescu and Mitchell[2001] show that the optimal TSP tour on the\ncenters of the disks is a $3.547$-approximation to the TSPN version. The core\nof their analysis is based on bounding the detour that the optimal TSPN tour\nhas to make in order to visit the centers of each disk and shows that it is at\nmost $2Rn$ in the worst case. H\\\"{a}me, Hyyti\\\"{a} and Hakula[2011] asked\nwhether this bound is tight when $R$ is small and conjectured that it is at\nmost $\\sqrt{3}Rn$.\n  We further investigate this question and derive structural properties of the\noptimal TSPN tour to describe the cases in which the bound is smaller than\n$2Rn$. Specifically, we show that if the optimal TSPN tour is not a straight\nline, at least one of the following is guaranteed to be true: the bound is\nsmaller than $1.999Rn$ or the $TSP$ on the centers is a $2$-approximation. The\nlatter bound of $2$ is the best that we can get in general. Our framework is\nbased on using the optimality of the TSPN tour to identify local structures for\nwhich the detour is large and then using their geometry to derive better lower\nbounds on the length of the TSPN tour. This leads to an improved approximation\nfactor of $3.53$ for disjoint uniform disks and $6.728$ for the general case.\nWe further show that the H\\\"{a}me, Hyyti\\\"{a} and Hakula conjecture is true for\nthe case of three disks and discuss the method used to obtain it. Along the\nway, we will uncover one way in which the TSPN problem is structurally\ndifferent from the classical TSP.\n",

Miniam [DCG (2012)], and to compute the PH of an\ninduced sequence of reduced simplicial complexes that has the same PH as the\ninitial one. Our approach has several salient features that distinguishes it\nfrom previous work. It is not limited to filtrations (i.e. sequences of nested\nsimplicial subcomplexes) but works for other types of sequences like towers and\nzigzags. To strong collapse a simplicial complex, we only need to store the\nmaximal simplices of the complex, not the full set of all its simplices, which\nsaves a lot of space and time. Moreover, the complexes in the sequence can be\nstrong collapsed independently and in parallel. Finally, we can compromize\nbetween precision and time by choosing the number of simplicial complexes of\nthe sequence we strong collapse. As a result and as demonstrated by numerous\nexperiments on publicly available data sets, our approach is extremely fast and\nmemory efficient in practice.\n",

However, there has been only limited algorithmic\ndevelopment to compute or approximate this distance. We focus on computing the\nGromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric trees. Roughly speaking, a metric\ntree is a metric space that can be realized by the shortest path metric on a\ntree. Previously, Agarwal et al. showed that even for trees with unit edge\nlength, it is NP hard to approximate the GH distance between them within a\nfactor of 3. In this paper, we present a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)\nalgorithm that can approximate the GH distance between two general metric trees\nwithin a factor of 14.\n  Interestingly, the development of our algorithm is made possible by a\nconnection between the GH distance for metric trees and the interleaving\ndistance for the so-called merge trees. The merge trees arise in practice\nnaturally as a simple yet meaningful topological summary, and are of\nindependent interest. It turns out that an exact or approximation algorithm for\nthe interleaving distance leads to an approximation algorithm for the\nGromov-Hausdorff distance. One of the key contributions of our work is that we\nre-define the interleaving distance in a way that makes it easier to develop\ndynamic programming approaches to compute it. We then present a FPT algorithm\nto compute the interleaving distance between two merge trees exactly, which\nultimately leads to an FPT-algorithm to approximate the GH distance between two\nmetric trees. This exact FPT-algorithm to compute the interleaving distance\nbetween merge trees is of interest itself, as it is known that it is NP-hard to\napproximate it within a factor of 3, and previously the best known algorithm\nhas an approximation factor of $O(\\sqrt{n})$ even for trees with unit edge\nlength.\n",

The major issue for push-pull direct\nmodeling is the possible inconsistency between the altered geometry of the\nmodel and its unchanged topology. The challenge of resolving the\ngeometry-topology inconsistency lies in ensuring that the resulting model\nremains as a valid solid model and that the model shape follows a continuous\nchange pattern. Although push-pull direct modeling has been implemented in\nseveral CAD software packages, robustness towards generating valid modeling\nresults and continuous shape changes still remains an open issue. This paper\nproposes a systematic method to handle the resolution of any possible\ninconsistent situation. The method formulates the continuous shape change\nrequirement as successive Boolean operations on the model volume, thereby\nguaranteeing valid solid models and continuous shape changes. Further, this\nformulation allows for an easy implementation of push-pull direct modeling\nusing existing CAD research and engineering results. In order to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, a software prototype is developed and the\nmodeling results are compared with those of five leading CAD software packages.\n",

The agent navigates in the\nterrain, avoiding obstacles, and finds the treasure when there is a segment of\nlength at most 1 between them, unobstructed by the boundary of the terrain or\nby the obstacles. The cost of finding the treasure is the length of the\ntrajectory of the agent. We investigate the amount of information that the\nagent needs a priori in order to find the treasure at cost $O(L)$, where $L$ is\nthe length of the shortest path in the terrain from the initial position of the\nagent to the treasure, avoiding obstacles. Following the paradigm of algorithms\nwith advice, this information is given to the agent in advance as a binary\nstring, by an oracle cooperating with the agent and knowing the whole\nenvironment: the terrain, the position of the treasure and the initial position\nof the agent. Advice complexity of treasure hunt is the minimum length of the\nadvice string (up to multiplicative constants) that enables the agent to find\nthe treasure at cost $O(L)$.\n  We first consider treasure hunt in regular terrains which are defined as\nconvex polygons with convex $c$-fat obstacles, for some constant $c>1$.

We utilise medial\naxis technology to robustly partition the near-field into blocks which can be\nmeshed coarsely with a linear swept mesher. A high-order mesh of the near-field\nis then generated and split using an isoparametric approach which allows us to\nobtain highly stretched elements aligned with the flow field. Special treatment\nof the partition is performed on the wing root juntion and the trailing edge\n--- into the wake --- to obtain an H-type mesh configuration with anisotropic\nhexahedra ideal for the strong shear of high Reynolds number simulations. We\nthen proceed to discretise the far-field using traditional robust tetrahedral\nmeshing tools. This workflow is made possible by two sets of tools: CADfix,\nfocused on CAD system, the block partitioning of the near-field and the\ngeneration of a linear mesh; and NekMesh, focused on the curving of the\nhigh-order mesh and the generation of highly-stretched boundary layer elements.\nWe demonstrate this approach on a NACA0012 wing attached to a wall and show\nthat a gap between the wake partition and the wall can be inserted to remove\nthe dependency of the partitioning procedure on the local geometry.\n",

Numerous applications require to visualise an overall shape of a\nnoisy cloud of points sampled from a non-linear object that is more complicated\nthan a union of disjoint clusters. The skeletonisation problem in its hardest\nform is to find a 1-dimensional skeleton that correctly represents a shape of\nthe cloud. This paper compares several algorithms that solve the above\nskeletonisation problem for any point cloud and guarantee a successful\nreconstruction. For example, given a highly noisy point sample of an unknown\nunderlying graph, a reconstructed skeleton should be geometrically close and\nhomotopy equivalent to (has the same number of independent cycles as) the\nunderlying graph. One of these algorithm produces a Homologically Persistent\nSkeleton (HoPeS) for any cloud without extra parameters. This universal\nskeleton contains sub-graphs that provably represent the 1-dimensional shape of\nthe cloud at any scale. Other subgraphs of HoPeS reconstruct an unknown graph\nfrom its noisy point sample with a correct homotopy type and within a small\noffset of the sample. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real data\nreveal for the first time the maximum level of noise that allows successful\ngraph reconstructions.\n",

        "summary": "  Tverberg's theorem states that for any $k \\ge 2$ and any set $P \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^d$ of at least $(d + 1)(k - 1) + 1$ points in $d$ dimensions, we can\npartition $P$ into $k$ subsets whose convex hulls have a non-empty\nintersection. The associated search problem of finding the partition lies in\nthe complexity class $\\text{CLS} = \\text{PPAD} \\cap \\text{PLS}$, but no\nhardness results are known. In the colorful Tverberg theorem, the points in $P$\nhave colors, and under certain conditions, $P$ can be partitioned into colorful\nsets, in which each color appears exactly once and whose convex hulls\nintersect. To date, the complexity of the associated search problem is\nunresolved. Recently, Adiprasito, Barany, and Mustafa gave a no-dimensional\nTverberg theorem, in which the convex hulls may intersect in an approximate\nfashion. This relaxes the requirement on the cardinality of $P$. The argument\nis constructive, but does not result in a polynomial-time algorithm.\n  We present a deterministic algorithm that finds for any $n$-point set $P\n\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ and any $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$ in $O(nd \\lceil{\\log\nk}\\rceil)$ time a $k$-partition of $P$ such that there is a ball of radius\n$O\\left((k/\\sqrt{n})\\mathrm{diam(P)}\\right)$ that intersects the convex hull of\neach set. Given that this problem is not known to be solvable exactly in\npolynomial time, our result provides a remarkably efficient and simple new\nnotion of approximation.\n  Our main contribution is to generalize Sarkaria's method to reduce the\nTverberg problem to the Colorful Caratheodory problem (in the simplified tensor\nproduct interpretation of Barany and Onn) and to apply it algorithmically. It\nturns out that this not only leads to an alternative algorithmic proof of a\nno-dimensional Tverberg theorem, but it also generalizes to other settings such\nas the colorful variant of the problem.\n",

We design\ndata structures in an \\emph{asymmetric} setting where the input is a curve (or\na set of $n$ curves) each of complexity $m$ and the queries are with curves of\ncomplexity $k\\ll m$. We show that there exist approximate data structures that\nare independent of the input size $N = d \\cdot n \\cdot m$ and we study how to\nmaintain them dynamically if the input is given in the stream.\n  Concretely, we study two types of data structures: (i) distance oracles,\nwhere the task is to store a compressed version of the input curve, which can\nbe used to answer queries for the distance of a query curve to the input curve,\nand (ii) nearest-neighbor data structures, where the task is to preprocess a\nset of input curves to answer queries for the input curve closest to the query\ncurve. In both cases we are interested in approximation. For curves embedded in\nEuclidean $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with constant $d$, our distance oracle uses space in\n$\\mathcal{O}((k \\log(\\epsilon^{-1}) \\epsilon^{-d})^k)$ ($\\epsilon$ is the\nprecision parameter). The oracle performs $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate queries in\ntime in $\\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ and is deterministic. We show how to maintain this\ndistance oracle in the stream using polylogarithmic additional memory. In the\nstream, we can dynamically answer distance queries to the portion of the stream\nseen so far in $\\mathcal{O}(k^4 \\log^2 m)$ time. We apply our techniques to the\nsecond problem, approximate near neighbor (ANN) data structures, and achieve an\nexponential improvement in the dependency on the complexity of the input curves\ncompared to the state of the art.\n",

While previous work within this model of assembly has\nfocused on designing a specific board configuration for the assembly of a\nspecific given shape, we propose the problem of designing universal\nconfigurations that are capable of constructing a large class of shapes and\npatterns. In particular, for given integers $h,w$, we show that there exists a\nstrongly universal configuration (no excess particles) with $\\mathcal{O}(hw)$\n$1 \\times 1$ slidable particles that can be reconfigured to build any $h \\times\nw$ patterned rectangle. We then expand this result to show that there exists a\nweakly universal configuration that can build any $h \\times w$-bounded size\nconnected shape. Following these results, we go on to show the existence of a\nstrongly universal configuration which can assemble any shape within a\npreviously studied ``drop'' class, while using quadratically less space than\nprevious results.\n  Finally, we include a study of the complexity of motion planning in this\nmodel. We consider the problems of deciding if a board location can be occupied\nby any particle (occupancy problem), deciding if a specific particle may be\nrelocated to another position (relocation problem), and deciding if a given\nconfiguration of particles may be transformed into a second given configuration\n(reconfiguration problem). We show all of these problems to be PSPACE-complete\nwith the allowance of a single $2\\times 2$ polyomino in addition to $1\\times 1$\ntiles. We further show that relocation and occupancy remain PSPACE-complete\neven when the board geometry is a simple rectangle if domino polyominoes are\nincluded.\n",

Given a set of persistence diagrams ${\\cal\nP}_1,...,{\\cal P}_m$, for the data reduction purpose, one way to summarize\ntheir topological features is to compute the {\\em center} ${\\cal C}$ of them\nfirst under the bottleneck distance. We consider two discrete versions and one\ncontinuous version. For technical reasons, we first focus on the case when\n$|P_i|$'s are all the same (i.e., all have the same size $n$), and the problem\nis to compute a center point set $C$ under the bottleneck matching distance. We\nshow, by a non-trivial reduction from the Planar 3D-Matching problem, that this\nproblem is NP-hard even when $m=3$ diagrams are given. This implies that the\ngeneral center problem for persistence diagrams under the bottleneck distance,\nwhen $P_i$'s possibly have different sizes, is also NP-hard when $m\\geq 3$. On\nthe positive side, we show that this problem is polynomially solvable when\n$m=2$ and admits a factor-2 approximation for $m\\geq 3$. These positive results\nhold for any $L_p$ metric when $P_i$'s are point sets of the same size, and\nalso hold for the case when $P_i$'s have different sizes in the $L_\\infty$\nmetric (i.e., for the Center Persistence Diagram problem). This is the best\npossible in polynomial time for the Center Persistence Diagram under the\nbottleneck distance unless P = NP. All these results hold for both of the\ndiscrete versions as well as the continuous version; in fact, the NP-hardness\nand approximation results also hold under the Wasserstein distance for the\ncontinuous version.\n",

We expand upon a series of prior results which showed that (1)\nthe abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is intrinsically universal (IU) [FOCS\n2012], and (2) the class of directed aTAM systems is not IU [FOCS 2016]. IU for\na model (or class of systems within a model) means that there is a universal\ntile set which can be used to simulate an arbitrary system within that model\n(or class). Furthermore, the simulation must not only produce the same\nresultant structures, it must also maintain the full dynamics of the systems\nbeing simulated modulo only a scale factor. While the FOCS 2012 result showed\nthe standard, two-dimensional (2D) aTAM is IU, here we show this is also the\ncase for the 3D version. Conversely, the FOCS 2016 result showed the class of\naTAM systems which are directed (a.k.a. deterministic, or confluent) is not IU,\nimplying that nondeterminism is fundamentally required for such simulations.\nHere, however, we show that in 3D the class of directed aTAM systems is\nactually IU, i.e. there is a universal directed simulator for them. We then\nconsider the influence of more rigid notions of dimensionality. Namely, we\nintroduce the Planar aTAM, where tiles are not only restricted to binding in\nthe plane, but also to traveling in the plane, and prove that the Planar aTAM\nis not IU, and that the class of directed systems within the Planar aTAM also\nis not IU. Finally, analogous to the Planar aTAM, we introduce the Spatial\naTAM, its 3D counterpart, and prove that it is IU.\n  To prove our positive results we have not only designed, but also implemented\nwhat we believe to be the first IU tile set ever implemented and simulated in\nany tile assembly model.

We present an efficient algorithm for finding all the vertices of the\narrangement $A(L)$ of maximum level, where the level of a vertex $v$ is the\nnumber of lines of $L$ that pass strictly below $v$. The problem, posed in\nExercise~8.13 in de Berg etal [BCKO08], appears to be much harder than it\nseems, as this vertex might not be on the upper envelope of the lines.\n  We first assume that all the lines of $L$ are distinct, and distinguish\nbetween two cases, depending on whether or not the upper envelope of $L$\ncontains a bounded edge. In the former case, we show that the number of lines\nof $L$ that pass above any maximum level vertex $v_0$ is only $O(\\log n)$. In\nthe latter case, we establish a similar property that holds after we remove\nsome of the lines that are incident to the single vertex of the upper envelope.\nWe present algorithms that run, in both cases, in optimal $O(n\\log n)$ time.\n  We then consider the case where the lines of $L$ are not necessarily\ndistinct. This setup is more challenging, and the best we have is an algorithm\nthat computes all the maximum-level vertices in time $O(n^{4/3}\\log^{3}n)$.\n  Finally, we consider a related combinatorial question for degenerate\narrangements, where many lines may intersect in a single point, but all the\nlines are distinct: We bound the complexity of the weighted $k$-level in such\nan arrangement, where the weight of a vertex is the number of lines that pass\nthrough the vertex. We show that the bound in this case is $O(n^{4/3})$, which\nmatches the corresponding bound for non-degenerate arrangements, and we use\nthis bound in the analysis of one of our algorithms.\n",

The latter\nare plane curves which are the image of the boundary of an immersed disk. Our\nfirst contribution is to prove new sufficient combinatorial conditions for a\ncurve to be self-overlapping. We show that a curve $\\gamma$ with Whitney index\n1 and without any self-overlapping subcurves is self-overlapping. As a\ncorollary, we obtain sufficient conditions for self-overlappingness solely in\nterms of the Whitney index of the curve and its subcurves. These results follow\nfrom our second contribution, which shows that any plane curve $\\gamma$, modulo\na basepoint condition, is transformed into an interior boundary by wrapping\naround $\\gamma$ with Jordan curves. Equivalently, the minimum homotopy area of\n$\\gamma$ is reduced to the minimal possible threshold, namely the winding area,\nthrough wrapping. In fact, we show that $n+1$ wraps suffice, where $\\gamma$ has\n$n$ vertices. Our third contribution is to prove the equivalence of various\ndefinitions of self-overlapping curves and interior boundaries, often implicit\nin the literature. We also introduce and characterize zero-obstinance curves,\nfurther generalizations of interior boundaries defined by optimality in minimum\nhomotopy area.\n",

The\nconnection is not as clear for (geometric) terrains. It is known that the\nvisibility graph of any terrain $T$ is persistent, but it has been unclear\nwhether every persistent graph $G$ has a terrain $T$ such that $G$ is the\nvisibility graph of $T$. There actually have been several papers that claim\nthis to be the case (although no formal proof has ever been published), and\nrecent works made steps towards building a terrain reconstruction algorithm for\nany persistent graph. In this paper, we show that there exists a persistent\ngraph $G$ that is not the visibility graph for any terrain $T$.

In the regime of $\\Delta \\ll 2^{1/\\epsilon}$, this provides an\nimprovement over the lightness bound of Le and Solomon [FOCS 2019]; this regime\nof parameters is of practical interest, as point sets arising in real-life\napplications (e.g., for various random distributions) have polynomially bounded\nspread, while in spanner applications $\\epsilon$ often controls the precision,\nand it sometimes needs to be much smaller than $O(1/\\log n)$. Moreover, for\nspread polynomially bounded in $1/\\epsilon$, this upper bound provides a\nquadratic improvement over the non-Steiner bound of Le and Solomon [FOCS 2019],\nWe then demonstrate that such a light spanner can be constructed in\n$O_{\\epsilon}(n)$ time for polynomially bounded spread, where $O_{\\epsilon}$\nhides a factor of $\\mathrm{poly}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$.

The PIP\nalgorithms get direct or indirect geometric definition of a polygonal entity,\nand validate its containment of a given point. The PIP algorithms, which are\nworking directly on the geometric entities, derive linear boundary definitions\nfor the edges of the polygons. Moreover, almost all direct test methods rely on\nthe two-point form of the line equation to partition the space into\nhalf-spaces. Voronoi tessellations use an alternate approach for half-space\npartitioning. Instead of line equation, distance comparison between generator\npoints is used to accomplish the same task. Voronoi tessellations consist of\nconvex polygons, which are defined between generator points. Therefore, Voronoi\ntessellations have become an inspiration for us to develop a new approach of\nthe PIP testing, specialized for convex polygons. The equations, essential to\nthe conversion of a convex polygon to a Voronoi polygon, are derived. As a\nreference, a very standard convex PIP testing algorithm, \\textit{the sign of\noffset}, is selected for comparison. For generalization of the comparisons,\n\\textit{the ray crossing} algorithm is used as another reference. All\nalgorithms are implemented as vector and matrix operations without any\nbranching. This enabled us to benefit from the CPU optimizations of the\nunderlying linear algebra libraries. Experimentation showed that, our proposed\nalgorithm can have comparable performance characteristics with the reference\nalgorithms.

Classical results show that, when the dimension\n$d\\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\varepsilon>0$ are constant, every set $S$ of $n$ points\nin $d$-space admits an $(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanners with $O(n)$ edges and weight\nproportional to that of the Euclidean MST of $S$. Tight bounds on the\ndependence on $\\varepsilon>0$ for constant $d\\in \\mathbb{N}$ have been\nestablished only recently. Le and Solomon (FOCS 2019) showed that Steiner\npoints can substantially improve the lightness and sparsity of a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner.

We exploit efficient linear algebra algorithms and\nimplementations to address the aforemen-tioned computations in very high\ndimension.

It is not known whether or not these problems are NP-hard.\nWe present approximation algorithms with better approximation ratios for both\nproblems. The improved ratios are obtained mainly by employing the Steiner\nratio, which has not been used in this context earlier.\n  (i) Longest noncrossing spanning tree: Given a set of points in the plane,\nthe goal is to find a maximum-length noncrossing spanning tree. Alon,\nRajagopalan, and Suri (SoCG 1993) studied this problem for the first time and\ngave a $0.5$-approximation algorithm. Over the years, the approximation ratio\nhas been successively improved to $0.502$, $0.503$, and to $0.512$ which is the\ncurrent best ratio, due to Cabello et al.. We revisit this problem and improve\nthe ratio further to $0.519$. The improvement is achieved by a collection of\nideas, some from previous works and some new ideas (including the use of the\nSteiner ratio), along with a more refined analysis.\n  (ii) Longest spanning tree with neighborhoods: Given a collection of regions\n(neighborhoods) in the plane, the goal is to select a point in each\nneighborhood so that the longest spanning tree on selected points has maximum\nlength. We present an algorithm with approximation ratio $0.524$ for this\nproblem. The previous best ratio, due to Chen and Dumitrescu, is $0.511$ which\nis in turn the first improvement beyond the trivial ratio $0.5$. Our algorithm\nis fairly simple, its analysis is relatively short, and it takes linear time\nafter computing a diametral pair of points. The simplicity comes from the fact\nthat our solution belongs to a set containing three stars and one double-star.\nThe shortness and the improvement come from the use of the Steiner ratio.\n",

We present a solution approach that enumerates and\nverifies these combinatorial events for feasibility in overall\n$O(n^{4+\\epsilon})$ time using $O(n^{4+\\epsilon})$ space, for any constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$. The enumeration algorithm is highly parallel, considering that\neach combinatorial event can be generated and verified for feasibility\nindependently of the others. In the process of deriving our solution, we design\nthe first data structure for addressing a special instance of circular sector\nemptiness queries among polyhedral obstacles in three dimensional space, and\nprovide a simplified data structure for the corresponding emptiness query\nproblem in two dimensions.\n",

We also present a\ncomputational framework for optimizing supporting structures and adapting\nlattice structures with prescribed density distributions.

Our algorithm has running\ntime linear in $n$, sub-quartic in $m$ and quadratic in $\\epsilon^{-1}$. With\nhigh probability it returns $\\epsilon$-coresets of size quadratic in\n$\\epsilon^{-1}$ and logarithmic in $n$ and $m$. We achieve this result by\napplying the improved $\\epsilon$-coreset framework by Langberg and Feldman to a\ngeneralized $k$-median problem over an arbitrary metric space. Later we combine\nthis result with the recent result by Driemel et al. on the VC dimension of\nmetric balls under the Fr\\'echet distance. Furthermore, our framework yields\n$\\epsilon$-coresets for any generalized $k$-median problem where the range\nspace induced by the open metric balls of the underlying space has bounded VC\ndimension, which is of independent interest. Finally, we show that our\n$\\epsilon$-coresets can be used to improve the running time of an existing\napproximation algorithm for $(1,\\ell)$-median clustering.\n",

Ours is the first such\nresult, where the size of the coreset is independent of the number of input\ncurves/point sets to be clustered (although it still depends on the maximum\ncomplexity of each input object). Specifically, the size of the coreset is\n$\\Theta\\left(\\frac{k^3lm^{\\delta}d}{\\varepsilon^2}\\log\\left(\n\\frac{kl}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right)$ for any $\\delta > 0$, where $d$ is the\nambient dimension, $m$ is the maximum number of points in an input curve/point\nset, and $l$ is the maximum number of points allowed in a cluster center. We\nformally characterize a general condition on the restricted space of cluster\ncenters -- this helps us to generalize and apply the importance sampling\nframework, that was used by Langberg and Schulman for computing coresets for\n$k$-median clustering of $d$-dimensional points on normed spaces in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, to the problem of clustering curves and point sets using the\nFr\\'{e}chet and Hausdorff metrics. Roughly, the condition places an upper bound\non the number of different combinations of metric balls that the restricted\nspace of cluster centers can hit. We also derive lower bounds on the size of\nthe coreset, given the restriction that the coreset must be a subset of the\ninput objects.\n",

Modern implementations employ floating\npoint filtering techniques to combine efficiency and robustness, and\nstate-of-the-art predicates are guaranteed to be always exact while being only\nslightly slower than corresponding (inexact) floating point implementations.\nUnfortunately, if the input to these predicates is an intermediate construction\nof an algorithm, its floating point representation may be affected by an\napproximation error, and correctness is no longer guaranteed. This paper\nintroduces the concept of indirect geometric predicate: instead of taking the\nintermediate construction as an explicit input, an indirect predicate considers\nthe primitive geometric elements which are combined to produce such a\nconstruction. This makes it possible to keep track of the floating point\napproximation, and thus to exploit efficient filters and expansion arithmetic\nto exactly resolve the predicate with minimal overhead with respect to a naive\nfloating point implementation. As a representative example, we show how to\nextend standard predicates to the case of points of intersection of linear\nelements (i.e. lines and planes) and show that, on classical problems, this\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art solutions based on lazy exact\nintermediate representations.\n",

If we identify permutations of a\nsequence as representing the same instance, this essentially states that A is\noptimal on every possible input (and not only in the worst case).\n  We design instance-optimal algorithms for the problem of reporting, given a\nbichromatic set of points in the plane S, all pairs consisting of points of\ndifferent color which span an empty axis-aligned rectangle (or reporting all\npoints which appear in such a pair). This problem has applications for\ntraining-set reduction in nearest-neighbour classifiers.

Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the\nnumber of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms\nis the existence of an orthogonal representation that describes such drawings\ncombinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges around each vertex\nand the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any kind of geometric\ninformation such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths.\n  We generalize this idea to ortho-radial representations of ortho-radial\ndrawings, which are embeddings into an ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are\nconcentric circles around the origin and straight-line spokes emanating from\nthe origin but excluding the origin itself. Unlike the orthogonal case, there\nexist ortho-radial representations that do not admit a corresponding drawing,\nfor example so-called strictly monotone cycles. An ortho-radial drawing is\ncalled valid if it does not contain a strictly monotone cycle. Our first result\nis that an ortho-radial representation admits a corresponding drawing if and\nonly if it is valid. Previously such a characterization was only known for\northo-radial drawings of paths, cycles, and theta graphs, and in the special\ncase of rectangular drawings of cubic graphs, where the contour of each face is\nrequired to be a rectangle. Further, we give a quadratic-time algorithm that\ntests for an ortho-radial representation whether it is valid, and we show how\nto draw a valid ortho-radial representation in the same running time.\n  Altogether, this reduces the problem of computing a minimum-bend ortho-radial\ndrawing to the task of computing a valid ortho-radial representation with the\nminimum number of bends, and hence establishes an ortho-radial analogue of the\ntopology-shape-metrics framework for planar orthogonal drawings by Tamassia.\n",

Such separators are used in I/O-efficient solutions to\nmany fundamental problems on planar graphs such as breadth-first search,\nfinding single-source shortest paths, topological sorting, and finding strongly\nconnected components. Our main result is an I/O-efficient sampling-based\nalgorithm that, given a Koebe-embedding of a graph with $N$ vertices and a\nparameter $r$, computes an $r$-way separator for the graph under certain\nassumptions on the size of internal memory. Computing a Koebe-embedding of a\nplanar graph is difficult in practice and no known I/O-efficient algorithm\ncurrently exists. Therefore, we show how our algorithm can be generalized and\napplied directly to Delaunay triangulations without relying on a\nKoebe-embedding. This adaptation can produce many boundary vertices in the\nworst-case, however, to our knowledge our result is the first to be implemented\nin practice due to the many non-trivial and complex techniques used in previous\nresults. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm performs well on real-world\ndata and that the number of boundary vertices is small in practice.\n  Motivated by applications in geometric information systems, we show how our\nalgorithm for Delaunay triangulations can be applied to compute the flow\naccumulation over a terrain, which models how much water flows over the\nvertices of a terrain.

In this\npaper, we investigate the effect on the persistence diagram of a particular\ncontinuous operation on Reeb graphs; namely the (truncated) smoothing\noperation. This construction arises in the context of the Reeb graph\ninterleaving distance, but separately from that viewpoint provides a\nsimplification of the Reeb graph which continuously shrinks small loops. We\nthen use this characterization to initiate the study of inverse problems for\nReeb graphs using smoothing by showing which paths in persistence diagram space\n(commonly known as vineyards) can be realized by a path in the space of Reeb\ngraphs via these simple operations. This allows us to solve the inverse problem\non a certain family of piecewise linear vineyards when fixing an initial Reeb\ngraph.\n",

Given the outline of each floor, a list of\nroom sizes, and, for each room, the unit to which it belongs, the aim is to\ncompute floor plans such that each room is placed on some floor and the total\ndistance of the rooms within each unit is minimized.\n  The problem can be formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). Commercial\nILP solvers exist, but due to the difficulty of the problem, only small to\nmedium instances can be solved to (near-) optimality. For solving larger\ninstances, we propose to split the problem into two subproblems; floor\nassignment and planning single floors. We formulate both subproblems as ILPs\nand solve realistic problem instances. Our experimental study shows that the\nproblem helps to reduce the computation time considerably.

        "summary": "  The greedy spanner in a low dimensional Euclidean space is a fundamental\ngeometric construction that has been extensively studied over three decades as\nit possesses the two most basic properties of a good spanner: constant maximum\ndegree and constant lightness. Recently, Eppstein and Khodabandeh showed that\nthe greedy spanner in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a sublinear separator in a strong\nsense: any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has\na separator of size $O(\\sqrt{k})$. Their technique is inherently planar and is\nnot extensible to higher dimensions. They left showing the existence of a small\nseparator for the greedy spanner in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ for any constant $d\\geq 3$\nas an open problem. In this paper, we resolve the problem of Eppstein and\nKhodabandeh by showing that any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(k^{1-1/d})$. We introduce a new\ntechnique that gives a simple characterization for any geometric graph to have\na sublinear separator that we dub $\\tau$-lanky: a geometric graph is\n$\\tau$-lanky if any ball of radius $r$ cuts at most $\\tau$ edges of length at\nleast $r$ in the graph. We show that any $\\tau$-lanky geometric graph of $n$\nvertices in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(\\tau n^{1-1/d})$. We then\nderive our main result by showing that the greedy spanner is $O(1)$-lanky. We\nindeed obtain a more general result that applies to unit ball graphs and point\nsets of low fractal dimensions in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our technique naturally\nextends to doubling metrics. We use the $\\tau$-lanky characterization to show\nthat there exists a $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner for doubling metrics of dimension\n$d$ with a constant maximum degree and a separator of size\n$O(n^{1-\\frac{1}{d}})$; this result resolves an open problem posed by Abam and\nHar-Peled a decade ago.\n",

        "summary": "  The Polyline Bundle Simplification (PBS) problem is a generalization of the\nclassical polyline simplification problem. Given a set of polylines, which may\nshare line segments and points, PBS asks for the smallest consistent\nsimplification of these polylines with respect to a given distance threshold.\nHere, consistent means that each point is either kept in or discarded from all\npolylines containing it. In previous work, it was proven that PBS is NP-hard to\napproximate within a factor of $n^{\\frac{1}{3}-\\varepsilon}$ for any\n$\\varepsilon > 0$ where $n$ denotes the number of points in the input. This\nhardness result holds even for two polylines. In this paper we first study the\npractically relevant setting of planar inputs. While for many combinatorial\noptimization problems the restriction to planar settings makes the problem\nsubstantially easier, we show that the inapproximability bound known for\ngeneral inputs continues to hold even for planar inputs. We proceed with the\ninteresting special case of PBS where the polylines form a rooted tree. Such\ntree bundles naturally arise in the context of movement data visualization. We\nprove that optimal simplifications of these tree bundles can be computed in\n$O(n^3)$ for the Fr\\'echet distance and in $O(n^2)$ for the Hausdorff distance\n(which both match the computation time for single polylines). Furthermore, we\npresent a greedy heuristic that allows to decompose polyline bundles into tree\nbundles in order to make our exact algorithm for trees useful on general\ninputs. The applicability of our approaches is demonstrated in an experimental\nevaluation on real-world data.\n",

Specifically, if $r_{opt}$ is the optimal\nradius for $k$ centers, then in $n^{O(1/\\varepsilon^2)}$ time we can produce a\nset of $(1+\\varepsilon)k$ centers with radius $\\leq r_{opt}$. If instead one\nconsiders the standard goal of approximating the optimal clustering radius,\nwhile keeping $k$ as a hard constraint, we show that the radius cannot be\napproximated within any factor in polynomial time unless $\\mathsf{P=NP}$, even\nwhen $\\mathscr{C}$ is a set of line segments. When $\\mathscr{C}$ is a set of\nunit disks we show the problem is hard to approximate within a factor of\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{13}-\\sqrt{3}}{2-\\sqrt{3}}\\approx 6.99$. This hardness result\ncomplements our main result, where we show that when the objects are disks, of\npossibly differing radii, there is a $(5+2\\sqrt{3})\\approx 8.46$ approximation\nalgorithm. Additionally, for unit disks we give an $O(n\\log\nk)+(k/\\varepsilon)^{O(k)}$ time $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation to the optimal\nradius, that is, an FPTAS for constant $k$ whose running time depends only\nlinearly on $n$. Finally, we show that the one dimensional version of the\nproblem, even when intersections are allowed, can be solved exactly in $O(n\\log\nn)$ time.\n",

Accurate computation of these PD distances for large\ndata sets that render large diagrams may not scale appropriately with the\nexisting methods. The main source of difficulty ensues from the size of the\nbipartite graph on which a matching needs to be computed for determining these\nPD distances. We address this problem by making several algorithmic and\ncomputational observations in order to obtain an approximation. First, taking\nadvantage of the proximity of PD points, we condense them thereby decreasing\nthe number of nodes in the graph for computation. The increase in point\nmultiplicities is addressed by reducing the matching problem to a min-cost flow\nproblem on a transshipment network. Second, we use Well Separated Pair\nDecomposition to sparsify the graph to a size that is linear in the number of\npoints. Both node and arc sparsifications contribute to the approximation\nfactor where we leverage a lower bound given by the Relaxed Word Mover's\ndistance. Third, we eliminate bottlenecks during the sparsification procedure\nby introducing parallelism. Fourth, we develop an open source software called\nPDoptFlow based on our algorithm, exploiting parallelism by GPU and multicore.\nWe perform extensive experiments and show that the actual empirical error is\nvery low.

In\norder to evaluate how well the tessellation approximates the 2-dimensional\nspace, we study three types of shortest paths: a weighted shortest path $\n\\mathit{SP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest path from $ s $ to $ t $ in the\nspace; a weighted shortest vertex path $ \\mathit{SVP_w}(s,t) $, which is an\nany-angle shortest path; and a weighted shortest grid path $\n\\mathit{SGP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest path whose edges are edges of the\ntessellation.\n  Given any arbitrary weight assignment to the faces of a triangular\ntessellation, thus extending recent results by Bailey et al. [Path-length\nanalysis for grid-based path planning. Artificial Intelligence, 301:103560,\n2021], we prove upper and lower bounds on the ratios $ \\frac{\\lVert\n\\mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert \\mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\\rVert} $, $ \\frac{\\lVert\n\\mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert \\mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\\rVert} $, $ \\frac{\\lVert\n\\mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert \\mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\\rVert} $, which provide\nestimates on the quality of the approximation.\n  It turns out, surprisingly, that our worst-case bounds are independent of any\nweight assignment. Our main result is that $ \\frac{\\lVert\n\\mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\\rVert}{\\lVert \\mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\\rVert} =\n\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.15 $ in the worst case, and this is tight.

The\ndecisions are irrevocable, and while an optimal offline solution always matches\nall the points, an online algorithm cannot match all the points in the worst\ncase, unless it is given some side information, i.e., advice. We study two\nversions of this problem -- monomchromatic (MNM) and bichromatic (BNM).\n  We show that advice complexity of solving BNM optimally on a circle (or, more\ngenerally, on inputs in a convex position) is tightly bounded by the logarithm\nof the $n^\\text{th}$ Catalan number from above and below. This result corrects\nthe previous claim of Bose et al. that the advice complexity is $\\log(n!)$.

Each polygon is built from a terminal-edge region\nsurrounded by edges that are not the longest-edge of any of the two triangles\nthat share them. The algorithm is termed Polylla and is divided into three\nphases. The first phase consists of labeling each edge of the input\ntriangulation according to its size; the second phase builds polygons (simple\nor not) from terminal-edges regions using the label system; and the third phase\ntransforms each non simple polygon into simple ones. The final mesh contains\npolygons with convex and non convex shape. Since Voronoi based meshes are\ncurrently the most used polygonal meshes, we compare some geometric properties\nof our meshes against constrained Voronoi meshes. Several experiments were run\nto compare the shape and size of polygons, the number of final mesh points and\npolygons. For the same input, Polylla meshes contain less polygons than Voronoi\nmeshes, and the algorithm is simpler and faster than the algorithm to generate\nconstrained Voronoi meshes. Finally, we have validated Polylla meshes by\nsolving the Laplace equation on an L-shaped domain using the Virtual Element\nMethod (VEM).

Furthermore, we provide positive\nanswers for special classes of point sets, namely, for wheel sets and\ngeneralized double circles (which include, e.g., double chains and double\ncircles).\n",

It is defined as a min-max formulation that considers all\ndirection-preserving continuous bijections of the two curves. Because of its\nsusceptibility to noise, Driemel and Har-Peled introduced the shortcut\nFr\\'echet distance in 2012, where one is allowed to take shortcuts along one of\nthe curves, similar to the edit distance for sequences. We analyse the\nparameterized version of this problem, where the number of shortcuts is bounded\nby a parameter $k$. The corresponding decision problem can be stated as\nfollows: Given two polygonal curves $T$ and $B$ of at most $n$ vertices, a\nparameter $k$ and a distance threshold $\\delta$, is it possible to introduce\n$k$ shortcuts along $B$ such that the Fr\\'echet distance of the resulting curve\nand the curve $T$ is at most $\\delta$? We study this problem for polygonal\ncurves in the plane. We provide a complexity analysis for this problem with the\nfollowing results: (i) assuming the exponential-time-hypothesis (ETH), there\nexists no algorithm with running time bounded by $n^{o(k)}$; (ii) there exists\na decision algorithm with running time in $O(kn^{2k+2}\\log n)$. In contrast, we\nalso show that efficient approximate decider algorithms are possible, even when\n$k$ is large. We present a $(3+\\varepsilon)$-approximate decider algorithm with\nrunning time in $O(k n^2 \\log^2 n)$ for fixed $\\varepsilon$. In addition, we\ncan show that, if $k$ is a constant and the two curves are $c$-packed for some\nconstant $c$, then the approximate decider algorithm runs in near-linear time.\n",

Geometric constraint solving can date back to the very first\nCAD prototype, Sketchpad, in the 1960s, but serious research studies were\ncarried out only after parametric CAD was introduced in the late 1980s. In the\nfollowing 30-year history of GCS research, two development stages may be\nidentified: (1) the first 15 years (late 1980s - mid 2000s) were primarily\ndevoted to geometric constraint decomposition for well-constrained systems or\nthose with only structural constraint dependencies; and (2) the second 15 years\n(late 2000s - now) have seen research efforts shifted towards classification\ncriteria and decomposition algorithms for general constraint systems (with and\nwithout non-structural constraint dependencies). Most existing reviews focused\non the first 15 years. The problem researched in the second 15 years is,\nhowever, equally important, considering that a manually specified constraint\nsystem usually contains under- and over-constrained parts, and that such parts\nmust be correctly detected and resolved before numerical solving can work. In\nthis regard, this review paper covers both stages and will discusses what has\nalready been made possible for handling general constraint systems, what\ndevelopments can be expected in the near future, and which areas remain\nproblematic.\n",

The diameter of a graph is the\nlargest distance realized by a pair of vertices in the graph.\n  Computing the diameter in near-quadratic time is possible in several classes\nof intersection graphs [Chan and Skrepetos 2019], but it is not at all clear if\nthese algorithms are optimal, especially since in the related class of planar\ngraphs the diameter can be computed in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{5/3})$ time\n[Cabello 2019, Gawrychowski et al. 2021].\n  In this work we (conditionally) rule out sub-quadratic algorithms in several\nclasses of intersection graphs, i.e., algorithms of running time\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\\delta})$ for some $\\delta>0$.

In a recent experimental work of Brankovic et al., it was\ndemonstrated that clustering under CDTW avoids the unwanted artifacts that\nappear when clustering under Dynamic Time Warping and under the Fr\\'echet\ndistance.

Using\nalgebraic techniques, \"near-linear space\" structures [AMS13,MP15] with almost\noptimal query time of $Q(n)=O(n^{1-1/D+o(1)})$ were obtained. For \"fast query\"\nstructures (i.e., when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}$), it was conjectured that a structure\nwith space $S(n) = O(n^{D+o(1)})$ is possible. The conjecture was refuted\nrecently by Afshani and Cheng [AC21]. In the plane, they proved that $S(n) =\n\\Omega(n^{\\Delta+1 - o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\\Delta+3)\\Delta/2})$ which shows\n$\\Omega(n^{\\Delta+1-o(1)})$ space is needed for $Q(n) = n^{o(1)}$. While this\nrefutes the conjecture, it still leaves a number of unresolved issues: the\nlower bound only works in 2D and for fast queries, and neither the exponent of\n$n$ or $Q(n)$ seem to be tight even for $D=2$, as the current upper bound is\n$S(n) = O(n^{\\boldsymbol{m}+o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\\boldsymbol{m}-1)D/(D-1)})$ where\n$\\boldsymbol{m}=\\binom{D+\\Delta}{D}-1 = \\Omega(\\Delta^D)$ is the maximum number\nof parameters to define a monic degree-$\\Delta$ $D$-variate polynomial, for any\n$D,\\Delta=O(1)$.\n  In this paper, we resolve two of the issues: we prove a lower bound in\n$D$-dimensions and show that when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}+O(k)$,\n$S(n)=\\Omega(n^{\\boldsymbol{m}-o(1)})$, which is almost tight as far as the\nexponent of $n$ is considered in the pointer machine model. When considering\nthe exponent of $Q(n)$, we show that the analysis in [AC21] is tight for $D=2$,\nby presenting matching upper bounds for uniform random point sets. This shows\neither the existing upper bounds can be improved or a new fundamentally\ndifferent input set is needed to get a better lower bound.\n",

The $2$-center problem is a special case of the $k$-center\nproblem that has been extensively studied in the recent past \\cite{CAHN,HT,SH}.\nIn this paper, we consider a generalized version of the $2$-center problem\ncalled \\textit{proximity connected} $2$-center (PCTC) problem. In this problem,\nwe are also given a parameter $\\delta\\geq 0$ and we have the additional\nconstraint that the distance between the centers of the disks should be at most\n$\\delta$. Note that when $\\delta=0$, the PCTC problem is reduced to the\n$1$-center(minimum enclosing disk) problem and when $\\delta$ tends to infinity,\nit is reduced to the $2$-center problem. The PCTC problem first appeared in the\ncontext of wireless networks in 1992 \\cite{ACN0}, but obtaining a nontrivial\ndeterministic algorithm for the problem remained open. In this paper, we\nresolve this open problem by providing a deterministic $O(n^2\\log n)$ time\nalgorithm for the problem.\n",

We study this problem in\nthe form of a set cover problem for a given polygonal curve: find the smallest\nnumber $k$ of representative curves such that any point on the input curve is\ncontained in a subcurve that has Fr\\'echet distance at most a given $\\Delta$ to\na representative curve. We focus on the case where the representative curves\nare line segments and approach this NP-hard problem with classical techniques\nfrom the area of geometric set cover: we use a variant of the multiplicative\nweights update method which was first suggested by Br\\\"onniman and Goodrich for\nset cover instances with small VC-dimension. We obtain a\nbicriteria-approximation algorithm that computes a set of $O(k\\log(k))$ line\nsegments that cover a given polygonal curve of $n$ vertices under Fr\\'echet\ndistance at most $O(\\Delta)$. We show that the algorithm runs in\n$\\widetilde{O}(k^2 n + k n^3)$ time in expectation and uses $ \\widetilde{O}(k n\n+ n^3)$ space. For two dimensional input curves that are $c$-packed, we bound\nthe expected running time by $\\widetilde{O}(k^2 c^2 n)$ and the space by $\n\\widetilde{O}(kn + c^2 n)$. In $\\mathbb{R}^d$ the dependency on $n$ instead is\nquadratic. In addition, we present a variant of the algorithm that uses\nimplicit weight updates on the candidate set and thereby achieves near-linear\nrunning time in $n$ without any assumptions on the input curve, while keeping\nthe same approximation bounds. This comes at the expense of a small\n(polylogarithmic) dependency on the relative arclength.\n",

We propose the time-window Frechet distance, which enforces the\nmaximum temporal separation between points of two trajectories that can be\npaired in the calculation of the Frechet distance, and the metric-based edit\ndistance which incorporates the underlying metric in the computation of the\ninsertion and deletion costs.

We prove that k-gather\nremains NP-hard under edit distance, metric-based edit distance and Jaccard\ndistance.

The\nfirst data structure allow us to compute a region containing exactly the\n$k$-nearest neighbors of a query point $q$, and the second data structure can\nthen report the most frequent color in such a region.

Digital line segments are particularly important as\nother digital objects depend on their definition (e.g., digital convex objects\nor digital star-shaped objects). It may be desirable for the digital line\nsegment systems to satisfy some nice properties that their Euclidean\ncounterparts also satisfy. The system is a consistent digital line segment\nsystem (CDS) if it satisfies five properties, most notably the subsegment\nproperty (the intersection of any two digital line segments should be\nconnected) and the prolongation property (any digital line segment should be\nable to be extended into a digital line). It is known that any CDS must have\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ Hausdorff distance to their Euclidean counterparts, where $n$\nis the number of grid points on a segment. In fact this lower bound even\napplies to consistent digital rays (CDR) where for a fixed $p \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2$, we consider the digital segments from $p$ to $q$ for each $q \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2$. In this paper, we consider families of weak consistent digital\nrays (WCDR) where we maintain four of the CDR properties but exclude the\nprolongation property. In this paper, we give a WCDR construction that has\noptimal Hausdorff distance to the exact constant.

For a set of $n$ points in\nconvex position (whose flip graph is the 1-skeleton of the associahedron) we\nprove that the flip cut number is $n-3$.\n",

It aims to obtain some structural information (defined by an\naggregate function $F(\\cdot)$) of the points (from a point set $P$) inside a\ngiven query range $B$. In this paper, we study the range-aggregate query\nproblem in high dimensional space for two aggregate functions: (1) $F(P \\cap\nB)$ is the farthest point in $P \\cap B$ to a query point $q$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$\nand (2) $F(P \\cap B)$ is the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) of $P \\cap B$. For\nproblem (1), called In-Range Farthest Point (IFP) Query, we develop a\nbi-criteria approximation scheme: For any $\\epsilon>0$ that specifies the\napproximation ratio of the farthest distance and any $\\gamma>0$ that measures\nthe \"fuzziness\" of the query range, we show that it is possible to pre-process\n$P$ into a data structure of size $\\tilde{O}_{\\epsilon,\\gamma}(dn^{1+\\rho})$ in\n$\\tilde{O}_{\\epsilon,\\gamma}(dn^{1+\\rho})$ time such that given any\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ query ball $B$ and query point $q$, it outputs in\n$\\tilde{O}_{\\epsilon,\\gamma}(dn^{\\rho})$ time a point $p$ that is a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation of the farthest point to $q$ among all points\nlying in a $(1+\\gamma)$-expansion $B(1+\\gamma)$ of $B$, where $0<\\rho<1$ is a\nconstant depending on $\\epsilon$ and $\\gamma$ and the hidden constants in big-O\nnotations depend only on $\\epsilon$, $\\gamma$ and $\\text{Polylog}(nd)$.

We show that the minimum weight of a Euclidean\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner for $n$ points in the unit square $[0,1]^2$ is\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-3/2}\\,\\sqrt{n})$, and this bound is the best possible.

The standard way to mitigate computational issues arising\nfrom the high dimensionality of the data is by applying some dimension\nreduction technique that preserves the structural properties of the ambient\nspace. The dissimilarity between two time series is often measured by\n``discrete'' notions of distance, e.g. the dynamic time warping or the discrete\nFr\\'echet distance. Since all these distance functions are computed directly on\nthe points of a time series, they are sensitive to different sampling rates or\ngaps.

As input, we have a set of events, each associated with\na label at a fixed position, a timestamp, and a weight. Let a time-window\nlabeling be a selection of these labels such that all corresponding timestamps\nlie in a queried time window and no two labels overlap. A solution to the\ntime-window labeling problem consists of a data structure that encodes a\ntime-window labeling for each possible time window; when a user specifies a\ntime window of interest using a slider interface, we query the data structure\nfor the corresponding labeling.\n  We define the quality of a time-window labeling solution as the sum of the\nweights of the labels in each time-window labeling, integrated over all time\nwindows. We aim at maximizing the quality under the condition that a label may\nnever disappear when the user shrinks the time window. In this paper, we\nanalyze how well a greedy heuristic approximates the maximum quality that can\nbe realized under this condition.\n  On the one hand, we present an instance with square labels of equal size and\nequal weight for which the greedy heuristic fails to find a solution of at\nleast 1/4 of the quality of an optimal solution. On the other hand, we prove\nthat the greedy heuristic does guarantee a solution with at least 1/8 of the\nquality of an optimal solution. In the case of disk-shaped labels of equal size\nand equal weight, the greedy heuristic gives a solution with at least 1/10 of\nthe quality of an optimal solution. If the labels are squares or disks of equal\nsize and the maximum weight divided by the minimum weight is at most b, then\nthe greedy heuristic has approximation ratio Theta(log b).\n",

But how hard\nis it to check if a given family of high-dimensional point sets has this\nproperty? Starting from this question, we study several algorithmic aspects of\nthe existence of transversals and separations in high-dimensions.\n  First, we give an explicit proof that $k$ point sets are well-separated if\nand only if their convex hulls admit no $(k - 2)$-transversal, i.e., if there\nexists no $(k - 2)$-dimensional flat that intersects the convex hulls of all\n$k$ sets. It follows that the task of checking well-separation lies in the\ncomplexity class coNP. Next, we show that it is NP-hard to decide whether there\nis a hyperplane-transversal (that is, a $(d - 1)$-transversal) of a family of\n$d + 1$ line segments in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is part of the input. As a\nconsequence, it follows that the general problem of testing well-separation is\ncoNP-complete. Furthermore, we show that finding a hyperplane that maximizes\nthe number of intersected sets is NP-hard, but allows for an\n$\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\log k}{k \\log \\log k}\\right)$-approximation algorithm that\nis polynomial in $d$ and $k$, when each set consists of a single point.

In this variant we are not interested in guard sets of smallest\ncardinality, but in guard sets with largest possible distances between these\nguards. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been considered\nbefore. We call it the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem. In particular, in the\ndispersive art gallery problem we are given a polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ and a real\nnumber $\\ell$, and want to decide whether $\\mathcal{P}$ has a guard set such\nthat every pair of guards in this set is at least a distance of $\\ell$ apart.\n  In this paper, we study the vertex guard variant of this problem for the\nclass of polyominoes. We consider rectangular visibility and distances as\ngeodesics in the $L_1$-metric. Our results are as follows. We give a (simple)\nthin polyomino such that every guard set has minimum pairwise distances of at\nmost $3$. On the positive side, we describe an algorithm that computes guard\nsets for simple polyominoes that match this upper bound, i.e., the algorithm\nconstructs worst-case optimal solutions. We also study the computational\ncomplexity of computing guard sets that maximize the smallest distance between\nall pairs of guards within the guard sets. We prove that deciding whether there\nexists a guard set realizing a minimum pairwise distance for all pairs of\nguards of at least $5$ in a given polyomino is NP-complete. We were also able\nto find an optimal dynamic programming approach that computes a guard set that\nmaximizes the minimum pairwise distance between guards in tree-shaped\npolyominoes, i.e., computes optimal solutions. Because the shapes constructed\nin the NP-hardness reduction are thin as well (but have holes), this result\ncompletes the case for thin polyominoes.\n",

Computational contributions to this topic range\nfrom special parametrizations to discrete-isometric mappings. However, so far a\nlocal criterion expressing developability of general quad meshes has been\nlacking. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient discrete developability\ncriterion that is applied to quad meshes equipped with vertex weights, and\nwhich is motivated by a well-known characterization in differential geometry,\nnamely a rank-deficient second fundamental form. We assign contact elements to\nthe faces of meshes and ruling vectors to the edges, which in combination yield\na developability condition per face. Using standard optimization procedures, we\nare able to perform interactive design and developable lofting. The meshes we\nemploy are combinatorial regular quad meshes with isolated singularities but\nare otherwise not required to follow any special curves on a developable\nsurface. They are thus easily embedded into a design workflow involving\nstandard operations like remeshing, trimming, and merging operations. An\nimportant feature is that we can directly derive a watertight, rational\nbi-quadratic spline surface from our meshes.

The combination of these two properties, known respectively as\nstability and discriminativity, has led to theoretical distances which are\neither thought to be or shown to be computationally complex and thus their\nimplementations have been scarce. In order to design similarity measures on\nmerge trees which are computationally feasible for more complex merge trees,\nmany researchers have elected to loosen the restrictions on at least one of\nthese two properties. The question still remains, however, if there are\npractical situations where trading these desirable properties is necessary.\nHere we construct a distance between merge trees which is designed to retain\nboth discriminativity and stability. While our approach can be expensive for\nlarge merge trees, we illustrate its use in a setting where the number of nodes\nis small. This setting can be made more practical since we also provide a proof\nthat persistence simplification increases the outputted distance by at most\nhalf of the simplified value.

Existing algorithms [Damian and Pemmaraju,\nAlgorithmica, 2004] do not allow Steiner points, which means that all corners\nof the produced pieces must also be corners of $P$.

An open problem is whether one\ncan preprocess the road network into a data structure, so that map matching\nqueries can be answered in sublinear time.\n  In this paper, we investigate map matching queries under the Fr\\'echet\ndistance. We provide a negative result for geometric planar graphs. We show\nthat, unless SETH fails, there is no data structure that can be constructed in\npolynomial time that answers map matching queries in $O((pq)^{1-\\delta})$ query\ntime for any $\\delta > 0$, where $p$ and $q$ are the complexities of the\ngeometric planar graph and the query trajectory, respectively. We provide a\npositive result for realistic input graphs, which we regard as the main result\nof this paper. We show that for $c$-packed graphs, one can construct a data\nstructure of $\\tilde O(cp)$ size that can answer $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate\nmap matching queries in $\\tilde O(c^4 q \\log^4 p)$ time, where $\\tilde\nO(\\cdot)$ hides lower-order factors and dependence on $\\varepsilon$.\n",

As a geometric optimization problem of natural practical and\ntheoretical importance, the LMP generalizes and combines several notoriously\ndifficult problems, including minimum covering by disks, the Traveling Salesman\nProblem with neighborhoods (TSPN), and the Art Gallery Problem (AGP).\n  In this paper, we conduct the first study of the Lawn Mowing Problem with a\nfocus on practical computation of near-optimal solutions. We provide new\ntheoretical insights: Optimal solutions are polygonal paths with a bounded\nnumber of vertices, allowing a restriction to straight-line solutions; on the\nother hand, there can be relatively simple instances for which optimal\nsolutions require a large class of irrational coordinates. On the practical\nside, we present a primal-dual approach with provable convergence properties\nbased on solving a special case of the TSPN restricted to witness sets. In each\niteration, this establishes both a valid solution and a valid lower bound, and\nthereby a bound on the remaining optimality gap. As we demonstrate in an\nextensive computational study, this allows us to achieve provably optimal and\nnear-optimal solutions for a large spectrum of benchmark instances with up to\n2000 vertices.\n",

Many geometric set systems enjoy improved\napproximation ratios, which have recently been shown to be tight with respect\nto the shallow cell complexity of the set system. The algorithms that exploit\nthe cell complexity, however, tend to be involved and computationally\nintensive. This paper shows that a slightly improved asymptotic approximation\nratio for the hitting set problem can be attained using a much simpler\nalgorithm: solve the linear programming relaxation, take one initial random\nsample from the set of elements with probabilities proportional to the\nLP-solution, and, while there is an unhit set, take an additional sample from\nit proportional to the LP-solution. Our algorithm is a simple generalization of\nthe elegant net-finder algorithm by Nabil Mustafa. To analyze this algorithm\nfor the hitting set problem, we generalize the classic Packing Lemma, and the\nmore recent Shallow Packing Lemma, to the setting of weighted epsilon-nets.\n",

Coverings\nhave been employed in many applications, such as approximations for diameter,\nwidth, and $\\epsilon$-kernels of point sets, approximate nearest neighbor\nsearching, polytope approximations, and approximations to the Closest Vector\nProblem (CVP).\n  It is known how to construct coverings of size $n^{O(n)} /\n\\epsilon^{(n-1)/2}$ for general convex bodies in $\\textbf{R}^n$. In special\ncases, such as when the convex body is the $\\ell_p$ unit ball, this bound has\nbeen improved to $2^{O(n)} / \\epsilon^{(n-1)/2}$. This raises the question of\nwhether such a bound generally holds.

The reconstruction is based on basis functions\nwhich are optimized to provide a good fit to the point scan while satisfying\npredefined topological constraints. We optimize the parameters of a model to\nobtain likelihood function over the reconstruction domain. The topological\nconstraints are captured by persistence diagrams which are incorporated in the\noptimization algorithm promote the correct topology. The result is a novel\ntopology-aware technique which can: 1.) weed out topological noise from point\nscans, and 2.) capture certain nuanced properties of the underlying shape which\ncould otherwise be lost while performing surface reconstruction. We showcase\nresults reconstructing shapes with multiple potential topologies, compare to\nother classical surface construction techniques, and show the completion of\nreal scan data.\n",

In\nthis paper, a new weighted ranking function is proposed by combining the\nvalence prediction function of local singularity structure, shape quality\nmetric of elements and the width of base complex sheets/chords together.\nAdaptive refinement and local optimization are also introduced to improve the\nuniformity and aspect ratio of mesh elements. Compared to thickness ranking\nmethods, our weighted ranking approach can yield a simpler singularity\nstructure with fewer base-complex components, while achieving comparable\nHausdorff distance ratio and better mesh quality.

In recent times, new levels of\nrealism have been achieved by advances in GAN training procedures and\narchitectures. These successful models, however, are tuned mostly for use with\nregularly sampled data such as images, audio and video. Despite the successful\napplication of the architecture on these types of media, applying the same\ntools to geometric data poses a far greater challenge. The study of geometric\ndeep learning is still a debated issue within the academic community as the\nlack of intrinsic parametrization inherent to geometric objects prohibits the\ndirect use of convolutional filters, a main building block of today's machine\nlearning systems. In this paper we propose a new method for generating\nrealistic human facial geometries coupled with overlayed textures. We\ncircumvent the parametrization issue by imposing a global mapping from our data\nto the unit rectangle. We further discuss how to design such a mapping to\ncontrol the mapping distortion and conserve area within the mapped image. By\nrepresenting geometric textures and geometries as images, we are able to use\nadvanced GAN methodologies to generate new geometries. We address the often\nneglected topic of relation between texture and geometry and propose to use\nthis correlation to match between generated textures and their corresponding\ngeometries. We offer a new method for training GAN models on partially\ncorrupted data.

Prior work [Radermacher et al.,\nALENEX'18] is limited to the crossing-minimization in geometric graphs with\nless than $200$ edges. The described heuristics base on the primitive operation\nof moving a single vertex $v$ to its crossing-minimal position, i.e., the\nposition in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that minimizes the number of crossings on edges\nincident to $v$.\n  In this paper, we introduce a technique to speed-up the computation by a\nfactor of $20$. This is necessary but not sufficient to cope with graphs with a\nfew thousand edges. In order to handle larger graphs, we drop the condition\nthat each vertex $v$ has to be moved to its crossing-minimal position and\ncompute a position that is only optimal with respect to a small random subset\nof the edges. In our theoretical contribution, we consider drawings that\ncontain for each edge $uv \\in E$ and each position $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ for $v$\n$o(|E|)$ crossings. In this case, we prove that with a random subset of the\nedges of size $\\Theta(k \\log k)$ the co-crossing number of a degree-$k$ vertex\n$v$, i.e., the number of edge pairs $uv \\in E, e \\in E$ that do not cross, can\nbe approximated by an arbitrary but fixed factor $\\delta$ with high\nprobability. In our experimental evaluation, we show that the randomized\napproach reduces the number of crossings in graphs with up to $13\\,000$ edges\nconsiderably. The evaluation suggests that depending on the degree-distribution\ndifferent strategies result in the fewest number of crossings.\n",

Using persistent homology,\nspecifically persistence diagrams, as inputs to machine learning techniques\nrequires some mathematical creativity. The space of persistence diagrams does\nnot have the desirable properties for machine learning, thus methods such as\nkernel methods and vectorization methods have been developed. One such\nfeaturization of persistence diagrams by Perea, Munch and Khasawneh uses\ncontinuous, compactly supported functions, referred to as \"template functions,\"\nwhich results in a stable vector representation of the persistence diagram. In\nthis paper, we provide a method of adaptively partitioning persistence diagrams\nto improve these featurizations based on localized information in the diagrams.\nAdditionally, we provide a framework to adaptively select parameters required\nfor the template functions in order to best utilize the partitioning method. We\npresent results for application to example data sets comparing classification\nresults between template function featurizations with and without partitioning,\nin addition to other methods from the literature.\n",

In the classic formulation of Art Gallery, G and C consist of all\nthe points within P. Other well-known variants restrict G and C to consist\neither of all the points on the boundary of P or of all the vertices of P.\nRecently, three new important discoveries were made: the above mentioned\nvariants of Art Gallery are all W[1]-hard with respect to k [Bonnet and\nMiltzow, ESA'16], the classic variant has an O(log k)-approximation algorithm\n[Bonnet and Miltzow, SoCG'17], and it may require irrational guards [Abrahamsen\net al., SoCG'17]. Building upon the third result, the classic variant and the\ncase where G consists only of all the points on the boundary of P were both\nshown to be \\exists R-complete~[Abrahamsen et al., STOC'18]. Even when both G\nand C consist only of all the points on the boundary of P, the problem is not\nknown to be in NP.\n  Given the first discovery, the following question was posed by Giannopoulos\n[Lorentz Center Workshop, 2016]: Is Art Gallery FPT with respect to r, the\nnumber of reflex vertices? We focus on the variant where G and C are all the\nvertices of P, called Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery. We show that Vertex-Vertex Art\nGallery is solvable in time r^{O(r^2)}n^{O(1)}. Our approach also extends to\nassert that Vertex-Boundary Art Gallery and Boundary-Vertex Art Gallery are\nboth FPT.

The topology of these\nintersections is codified within a set of (0-2)-dimensional chain complexes.\nThe target of this paper is to merge the local chains by using the equivalence\nrelations of {\\epsilon}-congruence between 0-, 1-, and 2-cells (elementary\nchains). In particular, we reduce the block-diagonal coboundary matrices\n[\\Delta_0] and [\\Delta_1], used as matrix accumulators of the local coboundary\nchains, to the global matrices [\\delta_0] and [\\delta_1], representative of\ncongruence topology, i.e., of congruence quotients between all 0-,1-,2-cells,\nvia elementary algebraic operations on their columns. This algorithm is\ncodified using the Julia porting of the SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS implementation of\nthe GraphBLAS standard, conceived to efficiently compute algorithms on large\ngraphs using linear algebra and sparse matrices [1, 2].\n",

In this\npaper we investigate representations of planar triangulations as contact graphs\nof a set of internally disjoint homothetic pentagons. Surprisingly such a\nrepresentation exists for every triangulation whose outer face is a 5-gon. We\nrelate these representations to five color forests. These combinatorial\nstructures resemble Schnyder woods and transversal structures, respectively. In\nparticular there is a bijection to certain alpha-orientations and consequently\na lattice structure on the set of five color forests of a given graph. This\nlattice structure plays a role in an algorithm that is supposed to compute a\ncontact representation with pentagons for a given graph. Based on a five color\nforest the algorithm builds a system of linear equations and solves it, if the\nsolution is non-negative, it encodes distances between corners of a pentagon\nrepresentation. In this case the representation is constructed and the\nalgorithm terminates. Otherwise negative variables guide a change of the five\ncolor forest and the procedure is restarted with the new five color forest.\nSimilar algorithms have been proposed for contact representations with\nhomothetic triangles and with squares.\n",

In\nthis paper, we study the fundamental minimum enclosing ball (MEB) with outliers\nproblem first; partly inspired by the core-set method from B\\u{a}doiu and\nClarkson, we propose a sub-linear time bi-criteria approximation algorithm\nbased on two novel techniques, the Uniform-Adaptive Sampling method and\nSandwich Lemma. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first\nsub-linear time algorithm, which has the sample size ({\\em i.e.,} the number of\nsampled points) independent of both the number of input points $n$ and\ndimensionality $d$, for MEB with outliers in high dimensions. Furthermore, we\nobserve that these two techniques can be generalized to deal with a broader\nrange of geometric optimization problems with outliers in high dimensions,\nincluding flat fitting, $k$-center clustering, and SVM with outliers, and\ntherefore achieve the sub-linear time algorithms for these problems\nrespectively.\n",

There are\ntwo such types of 3D gadgets. One is the conventional type of 3D gadgets with a\ntriangular pyramid supporting the two side faces from inside. The other is the\nnewer type of 3D gadgets presented in our previous paper, which improve the\nconventional ones in several respects: They have flat back sides above the\nambient paper and no gap between the side faces; they are less interfering with\nadjacent gadgets so that we can make the extrusion higher at one time; they are\ndownward compatible with conventional ones if constructible; they have a\nmodified flat-back gadget used for repetition which does not interfere with\nadjacent gadgets; the angles of their outgoing pleats can be changed under\ncertain conditions. However, there are cases where we can apply the\nconventional gadgets while we cannot our previous ones. The purpose of this\npaper is to improve our previous 3D gadgets to be completely downward\ncompatible with the conventional ones, in the sense that any conventional\ngadget can be replaced by our improved one with the same outgoing pleats, but\nthe converse is not always possible. To be more precise, we prove that for any\ngiven conventional 3D gadget there are an infinite number of improved 3D\ngadgets which are compatible with it, and the conventional 3D gadget can be\nreplaced with any of these 3D gadgets without affecting any other conventional\n3D gadget.

In 3DGS, the form of the\nstructure and its equilibrium of forces is represented by two polyhedral\ndiagrams that are geometrically and topologically related. The areas of the\nfaces of the force diagram represent the magnitude of the internal and external\nforces in the system. For the first time, the methods of this research allow\nthe user to control and constrain the areas and edge lengths of the faces of\ngeneral polyhedrons that can be convex, self-intersecting, or concave. As a\nresult, a designer can explicitly control the force magnitudes in the force\ndiagram and explore the equilibrium of a variety of compression and\ntension-combined funicular structural forms. In this method, a quadratic\nformulation is used to compute the area of a single face based on its edge\nlengths. The approach is applied to manipulating the face geometry with a\npredefined area and the edge lengths. Subsequently, the geometry of the\npolyhedron is updated with newly changed faces. This approach is a multi-step\nalgorithm where each step includes computing the geometry of a single face and\nupdating the polyhedral geometry. One of the unique results of this framework\nis the construction of the zero-area, self-intersecting faces, where the sum of\nthe signed areas of a self-intersecting face is zero, representing a member\nwith zero force in the form diagram. The methodology of this research can\nclarify the equilibrium of some systems that could not be previously justified\nusing reciprocal polyhedral diagrams. Therefore, it generalizes the principle\nof the equilibrium of polyhedral frames and opens a completely new horizon in\nthe design of highly-sophisticated funicular polyhedral structures beyond\ncompression-only systems.\n",

This study aims to propose a\nmanufacturing cost prediction process for 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models\nusing explainable artificial intelligence. The proposed process can visualize\nthe machining features of the 3D CAD model that are influencing the increase in\nmanufacturing costs. The proposed process consists of (1) data collection and\npre-processing, (2) 3D deep learning architecture exploration, and (3)\nvisualization to explain the prediction results. The proposed deep learning\nmodel shows high predictability of manufacturing cost for the computer\nnumerical control (CNC) machined parts. In particular, using 3D\ngradient-weighted class activation mapping proves that the proposed model not\nonly can detect the CNC machining features but also can differentiate the\nmachining difficulty for the same feature. Using the proposed process, we can\nprovide a design guidance to engineering designers in reducing manufacturing\ncosts during the conceptual design phase. We can also provide real-time\nquotations and redesign proposals to online manufacturing platform customers.\n",

In this\npaper, we present a secure two-party protocol to determine the existence of an\nintersection between entities. The protocol presented in this paper allows for\nintersection detection in three-dimensional spaces in geometry. Our approach is\nto use an intersecting plane between two spaces to determine their separation\nor intersection. For this purpose, we introduce a computational geometry\nprotocol to determine the existence of an intersecting plane. In this paper, we\nfirst use the Minkowski difference to reduce the two-space problem into\none-space. Then, the separating set is obtained and the separation of two\nshapes is determined based on the inclusion of the center point. We then secure\nthe protocol by modifying the separating set computation method as a\nprivacy-preserver and changing the Minkowski difference method to achieve this\ngoal. The proposed protocol applies to any form of convex three-dimensional\nshape. The experiments successfully found a secure protocol for intersection\ndetection between two convex hulls in geometrical shapes such as the pyramid\nand cuboid.\n",

In the literature, this is commonly referred to as\nVolume-of-Fluid (VoF) interface positioning problem. The novelty of our work is\ntwofold: firstly, by recursive application of the Gaussian divergence theorem,\nthe volume of a truncated polyhedron can be computed at high efficiency, based\non summation over quantities associated to the faces of the polyhedron. One\nobtains a very convenient piecewise parametrization (within so-called brackets)\nin terms of the signed distance s to the plane $\\Gamma$. As an implication, one\ncan restrain from the costly necessity to establish topological connectivity,\nrendering the present approach most suitable for the application to\nunstructured computational meshes. Secondly, in the vicinity of the truncation\nposition s, the volume can be expressed exactly, i.e. in terms of a cubic\npolynomial of the normal distance to the PLIC plane. The local knowledge of\nderivatives enables to construct a root-finding algorithm that pairs bracketing\nand higher-order approximation. The performance is assessed by conducting an\nextensive set of numerical experiments, considering convex and non-convex\npolyhedra of genus (i.e., number of holes) zero and one in combination with\ncarefully selected volume fractions $\\alpha$ (including $\\alpha\\approx0$ and\n$\\alpha\\approx1$) and normal orientations $\\vec{n}_\\Gamma$.

Depending on this property, we can analyse whether an\nexisting moment-based feature is invariant to motion blur. Surprisingly, we\nfind some geometric moment invariants are invariants to not only spatial\ntransform but also motion blur.

For $k=3$, our algorithm runs in $O(m^{18}n)$\ntime, faster than the previous best algorithm, but gives a 4-approximate\nresult.

We phrase our problem as search in the space of such\nextrusions permitted by the zone graph, and we train a graph neural network to\nscore potential extrusions in order to accelerate the search.

Intuitively, persistent homology maps a\npotentially complex input object (be it a graph, an image, or a point set and\nso on) to a unified type of feature summary, called the persistence diagrams.\nOne can then carry out downstream data analysis tasks using such persistence\ndiagram representations. A key problem is to compute the distance between two\npersistence diagrams efficiently. In particular, a persistence diagram is\nessentially a multiset of points in the plane, and one popular distance is the\nso-called 1-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. In this paper,\nwe present two algorithms to approximate the 1-Wasserstein distance for\npersistence diagrams in near-linear time. These algorithms primarily follow the\nsame ideas as two existing algorithms to approximate optimal transport between\ntwo finite point-sets in Euclidean spaces via randomly shifted quadtrees. We\nshow how these algorithms can be effectively adapted for the case of\npersistence diagrams. Our algorithms are much more efficient than previous\nexact and approximate algorithms, both in theory and in practice, and we\ndemonstrate its efficiency via extensive experiments.

Its output is a\nparticular decomposition of the total boundary matrix, from which the\npersistence diagrams and generating cycles are derived. Persistence diagrams\nare known to vary continuously with respect to their input, motivating the\nstudy of their computation for time-varying filtered complexes. Computing\npersistence dynamically can be reduced to maintaining a valid decomposition\nunder adjacent transpositions in the filtration order. Since there are $O(m^2)$\nsuch transpositions, this maintenance procedure exhibits limited scalability\nand is often too fine for many applications. We propose a coarser strategy for\nmaintaining the decomposition over a 1-parameter family of filtrations. By\nreduction to a particular longest common subsequence problem, we show that the\nminimal number of decomposition updates $d$ can be found in $O(m \\log \\log m)$\ntime and $O(m)$ space, and that the corresponding sequence of permutations --\nwhich we call a schedule -- can be constructed in $O(d m \\log m)$ time. We also\nshow that, in expectation, the storage needed to employ this strategy is\nactually sublinear in $m$. Exploiting this connection, we show experimentally\nthat the decrease in operations to compute diagrams across a family of\nfiltrations is proportional to the difference between the expected quadratic\nnumber of states and the proposed sublinear coarsening.

Hence, for persistent\nhomology induced from PL functions, we propose levelset persistent cycles\nconsisting of a sequence of cycles that depict the evolution of homological\nfeatures from birth to death. Our definition is based on levelset zigzag\npersistence which involves four types of persistence intervals as opposed to\nthe two types in standard persistence. For each of the four types, we present a\npolynomial-time algorithm computing an optimal sequence of levelset persistent\n$p$-cycles for the so-called weak $(p+1)$-pseudomanifolds. Given that optimal\ncycle problems for homology are NP-hard in general, our results are useful in\npractice because weak pseudomanifolds do appear in applications. Our algorithms\ndraw upon an idea of relating optimal cycles to min-cuts in a graph that we\nexploited earlier for standard persistent cycles.

I extend this algorithm to generate truly Delaunay meshes by\nensuring that every triangular element on a facet satisfies Gabriel's\ncondition, i.e., its diametral sphere is empty. On an ``apex'' vertex where\nmultiple facets intersect, Gabriel's condition is satisfied by a modified\nsplit-on-a-sphere (SOS) technique. On a line where multiple facets intersect,\nGabriel's condition is satisfied by mirroring meshes near the line of\nintersection. The SOS technique ensures that the triangles on a facet near the\napex vertex have angles that are proportional to the angular feature size\n(AFS), a term I define in the paper. All tetrahedra (except ``near'' small\ninput angles) are well graded and have a radius-edge ratio less than $\\omega^*\n> \\sqrt{2}$ for a truly Delaunay mesh. The upper bounds for the radius-edge\nratio are an improvement by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ over current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n",

If the resolution limitation is not considered when\ndesigning for Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM), difficulties can arise\nin the manufacturing process, which may require the adaptation of the\ndeposition parameters. This work incorporates the nozzle size constraint into\nTopology Optimization (TO) in order to generate optimized designs suitable to\nthe process resolution. This article proposes and compares two methods, which\nare based on existing TO techniques that enable control of minimum and maximum\nmember size, and of minimum cavity size. The first method requires the minimum\nand maximum member size to be equal to the deposition nozzle size, thus design\nfeatures of uniform width are obtained in the optimized design. The second\nmethod defines the size of the solid members sufficiently small for the\nresulting structure to resemble a structural skeleton, which can be interpreted\nas the deposition path. Through filtering and projection techniques, the thin\nstructures are thickened according to the chosen nozzle size. Thus, a topology\ntailored to the size of the deposition nozzle is obtained along with a\ndeposition proposal. The methods are demonstrated and assessed using 2D and 3D\nbenchmark problems.\n",

In a\nrecent breakthrough, Mitchell [2021] obtained the first constant-factor\napproximation algorithm for MISR. His algorithm achieves an approximation ratio\nof 10 and it is based on a dynamic program that intuitively recursively\npartitions the input plane into special polygons called corner-clipped\nrectangles (CCRs), without intersecting certain special horizontal line\nsegments called fences.\n  In this paper, we present a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for MISR\nwhich is also based on a recursive partitioning scheme. First, we use a\npartition into a class of axis-parallel polygons with constant complexity each\nthat are more general than CCRs. This allows us to provide an arguably simpler\nanalysis and at the same time already improves the approximation ratio to 6.\nThen, using a more elaborate charging scheme and a recursive partitioning into\ngeneral axis-parallel polygons with constant complexity, we improve our\napproximation ratio to $2+\\epsilon$. In particular, we construct a recursive\npartitioning based on more general fences which can be sequences of up to\n$O(1/\\epsilon)$ line segments each. This partitioning routine and our other new\nideas may be useful for future work towards a PTAS for MISR.\n",

First, we give a much simpler algorithm to\nconstruct piecewise-linear morphs between planar straight-line graphs.\nSpecifically, given isomorphic straight-line drawings $\\Gamma_0$ and $\\Gamma_1$\nof the same 3-connected planar graph $G$, with the same convex outer face, we\nconstruct a morph from $\\Gamma_0$ to $\\Gamma_1$ that consists of $O(n)$\nunidirectional morphing steps, in $O(n^{1+\\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm\nentirely avoids the classical edge-collapsing strategy dating back to Cairns;\ninstead, in each morphing step, we interpolate the pair of weights associated\nwith a single edge. Second, we describe a natural extension of barycentric\ninterpolation to geodesic graphs on the flat torus. Barycentric interpolation\ncannot be applied directly in this setting, because the linear systems defining\nintermediate vertex positions are not necessarily solvable. We describe a\nsimple scaling strategy that circumvents this issue. Computing the appropriate\nscaling requires $O(n^{\\omega/2})$ time, after which we can can compute the\ndrawing at any point in the morph in $O(n^{\\omega/2})$ time.

Three shortcomings of previous works on light\nspanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can't be\napplied broadly. (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always\nsub-optimal, and usually far from optimal. (3) These constructions are optimal\nin the standard and crude sense, but not in a refined sense that takes into\naccount a wider range of involved parameters.\n  This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified\nframework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the\nframework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light\nspanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced\nthan that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. Our framework\nis developed in two papers. The current paper is the first of the two -- it\nlays the basis of the unified framework and then applies it to design fast\nconstructions with optimal lightness for several graph classes.\n  Among various applications and implications of our framework, we highlight\nhere the following:\n  _ In low-dimensional Euclidean spaces, we present an $O(n\\log n)$-time\nconstruction of $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanners with lightness and degree both bounded\nby constants in the algebraic computation tree (ACT). Our construction resolves\na major problem in the area of geometric spanners, which was open for three\ndecades.\n  _ In general graphs, for any $k \\geq 2$, we construct a\n$(2k-1)(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with lightness $O(n^{1/k})$ in $O(m \\alpha(m,n))$\ntime.

It also contains a re-working of the GUDHI library's implementation of\nBoissonnat and Pritam's Edge Collapser, which can be used as a pre-processing\nstep to dramatically reduce overall run-times in certain scenarios. Our\ncontribution is twofold: on the one hand, we integrate existing\nstate-of-the-art ideas coherently in a single library and provide Python\nbindings to the C++ code. On the other hand, we increase parallelization\nopportunities and improve overall performance by adopting more efficient data\nstructures. Our persistent homology backend establishes a new state of the art,\nsurpassing even GPU-accelerated implementations such as Ripser++ when using as\nfew as 5-10 CPU cores. Furthermore, our implementation of Edge Collapser has\nfewer software dependencies and improved run-times relative to GUDHI's original\nimplementation.\n",

We provide a\npolynomial time algorithm to exactly compute this optimal approximation which,\ntogether with the polynomial-time computable bottleneck distance among interval\ndecomposable modules, provides a lower bound on the interleaving distance.\nNext, we leverage this result to derive a polynomial-time computable distance\nfor general multi-parameter persistence modules which enjoys similar\nstability-like property.

This gives the first\nresults for dynamic independent set in a wide variety of geometric settings,\nsuch as disks, fat polygons, and their high-dimensional equivalents.\n  Our result is obtained via a two-level approach.

Flow aggregation, namely origins and destinations\naggregated simultaneously, is one of the most common patterns, say the\naggregated origin-to-destination flows between two transport hubs may indicate\nthe great traffic demand between two sites. Developing a clustering method for\nconstrained flows is crucial for determining urban flow aggregation. Among\nexisting methods about identifying flow aggregation, L-function of flows is the\nmajor one. Nevertheless, this method depends on the aggregation scale, the key\nparameter detected by Euclidean L-function, it does not adapt to road network.\nThe extracted aggregation may be overestimated and dispersed. Therefore, we\npropose a clustering method based on L-function of Manhattan space, which\nconsists of three major steps. The first is to detect aggregation scales by\nManhattan L-function. The second is to determine core flows possessing highest\nlocal L-function values at different scales. The final step is to take the\nintersection of core flows neighbourhoods, the extent of which depends on\ncorresponding scale. By setting the number of core flows, we could concentrate\nthe aggregation and thus highlight Aggregation Artery Architecture (AAA), which\ndepicts road sections that contain the projection of key flow cluster on the\nroad networks. Experiment using taxi flows showed that AAA could clarify\nresident movement type of identified aggregated flows. Our method also helps\nselecting locations for distribution sites, thereby supporting accurate\nanalysis of urban interactions.\n",

Two variants of this problem, both originating from\nprotein conformation, are based on a given vertex order (which abstracts the\nprotein backbone). Both variants involve an element of discrete decision in the\nrealization of the next vertex in the order using $K$ preceding (already\nrealized) vertices. The difference between these variants is that one requires\nthe $K$ preceding vertices to be contiguous. The presence of this constraint\nallows one to prove, via a combinatorial counting of the number of solutions,\nthat the realization algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable. Its absence, on\nthe other hand, makes it possible to efficiently construct the vertex order\ndirectly from the graph. Deriving a combinatorial counting method without using\nthe contiguity requirement would therefore be desirable. In this paper we prove\nthat, unfortunately, such a counting method cannot be devised in general.\n",

The work is motivated by terrain covering applications in robotics, where\nthe goal is to find a set of efficient plans for a team of heterogeneous robots\nto cover a given area. Within this application, solving a polygon partitioning\nproblem is an essential stepping stone. Unlike previous work, the problem\nformulation proposed in this paper also considers a compactness metric of the\ngenerated sub-polygons, in addition to the area size constraints. Maximizing\nthe compactness of sub-polygons directly influences the optimality of any\ngenerated motion plans. Consequently, this increases the efficiency with which\nrobotic tasks can be performed within each sub-region. The proposed problem\nrepresentation is based on grid cell decomposition and a potential field model\nthat allows for the use of standard optimization techniques. A new algorithm,\nthe AreaDecompose algorithm, is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm\nincludes a number of existing and new optimization techniques combined with two\npost-processing methods. The approach has been evaluated on a set of randomly\ngenerated polygons which are then divided using different criteria and the\nresults have been compared with a state-of-the-art algorithm. Results show that\nthe proposed algorithm can efficiently divide polygon regions maximizing\ncompactness of the resulting partitions, where the sub-polygon regions are on\naverage up to 73% more compact in comparison to existing techniques.\n",

The\ntechnique used to prove the duality for non-zigzag persistence does not extend\nstraightforwardly to our case. Accordingly, taking a different route, we prove\nthe weak duality by converting a non-repetitive filtration to an up-down\nfiltration by a sequence of diamond switches.

The classical\nmultidimensional scaling (cMDS) algorithm is a widespread method to do this.\nHowever, theoretical analysis of the robustness of the algorithm and an\nin-depth analysis of its performance on non-Euclidean metrics is lacking.\n  In this paper, we derive a formula, based on the eigenvalues of a matrix\nobtained from $D$, for the Frobenius norm of the difference between $D$ and the\nmetric $D_{\\text{cmds}}$ returned by cMDS. This error analysis leads us to the\nconclusion that when the derived matrix has a significant number of negative\neigenvalues, then $\\|D-D_{\\text{cmds}}\\|_F$, after initially decreasing, will\neventually increase as we increase the dimension. Hence, counterintuitively,\nthe quality of the embedding degrades as we increase the dimension. We\nempirically verify that the Frobenius norm increases as we increase the\ndimension for a variety of non-Euclidean metrics. We also show on several\nbenchmark datasets that this degradation in the embedding results in the\nclassification accuracy of both simple (e.g., 1-nearest neighbor) and complex\n(e.g., multi-layer neural nets) classifiers decreasing as we increase the\nembedding dimension.\n  Finally, our analysis leads us to a new efficiently computable algorithm that\nreturns a matrix $D_l$ that is at least as close to the original distances as\n$D_t$ (the Euclidean metric closest in $\\ell_2$ distance). While $D_l$ is not\nmetric, when given as input to cMDS instead of $D$, it empirically results in\nsolutions whose distance to $D$ does not increase when we increase the\ndimension and the classification accuracy degrades less than the cMDS solution.\n",

Besides, we\nhave shown that the 5-colorability problem is NP-complete on visibility graphs\nof simple polygons, and 4-colorability is NP-complete on visibility graphs of\npolygons with holes.\n  Then, we move further with the notion of visibility, and define a graph class\nwhich considers the real-world limitations for the applications of visibility\ngraphs. That is, no physical object has infinite range, and two objects might\nnot be mutually visible from a certain distance although there are no obstacles\nin-between. To model this property, we introduce unit disk visibility graphs,\nand show that the 3-colorability problem is NP-complete for unit disk\nvisibility graphs of a set of line segments, and a polygon with holes.\n  After bridging the gap between the visibility and the unit disk graphs, we\nthen present our results on the recognition of unit disk graphs in a restricted\nsetting -- axes-parallel unit disk graphs. We show that the recognition of unit\ndisk graphs is NP-complete when the disks are centered on pre-given parallel\nlines.

In general rectangle stabbing problem, also known as\nhorizontal-vertical stabbing problem (HV-Stabbing), the goal is to find a set\nof rectilinear (i.e., either vertical or horizontal) line segments of minimum\ntotal length such that all rectangles are stabbed. Both variants are NP-hard.\nChan, van Dijk, Fleszar, Spoerhase, and Wolff [2018]initiated the study of\nthese problems by providing constant approximation algorithms. Recently,\nEisenbrand, Gallato, Svensson, and Venzin [2021] have presented a QPTAS and a\npolynomial-time 8-approximation algorithm for STABBING but it is was open\nwhether the problem admits a PTAS.\n  In this paper, we obtain a PTAS for STABBING, settling this question. For\nHV-Stabbing, we obtain a $(2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation. We also obtain PTASes\nfor special cases of HV-Stabbing: (i) when all rectangles are squares, (ii)\nwhen each rectangle's width is at most its height, and (iii) when all\nrectangles are $\\delta$-large, i.e., have at least one edge whose length is at\nleast $\\delta$, while all edge lengths are at most 1. Our result also implies\nimproved approximations for other problems such as generalized minimum\nManhattan network.\n",

We also introduce the concept of a\nstable approximation scheme (SAS). A SAS is an update algorithm that, for any\ngiven fixed parameter $\\varepsilon>0$, is $k(\\epsilon)$-stable and maintains a\nsolution with approximation ratio $1+\\varepsilon$, where the stability\nparameter $k(\\varepsilon)$ only depends on $\\varepsilon$ and not on the size of\n$P$. We study such trade-offs in three settings.\n  - In $\\mathbb{R}^1$, we present a SAS with $k(\\varepsilon)=O(1/\\varepsilon)$,\nwhich we show is tight in the worst case. We also present a 1-stable\n$(6+2\\sqrt{5})$-approximation algorithm, a $2$-stable 2-approximation\nalgorithm, and a $3$-stable $1.97$-approximation algorithm.\n  - In $\\mathbb{S}^1$ (where the underlying space is a circle) we prove that no\nSAS exists, even though an optimal solution can always be obtained by cutting\nthe circle at an appropriate point and solving the resulting problem in\n$\\mathbb{R}^1$.\n  - In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we also prove that no SAS exists, and we present a\n$O(1)$-stable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm.\n",

Centerline-based representation is widely used to model large\nvascular networks with small vessels, as it encodes both the geometric and\ntopological information and facilitates manual editing. In this work, we\npropose an automatic method to generate a structured hexahedral mesh suitable\nfor CFD directly from centerlines. We addressed both the modeling and meshing\ntasks. We proposed a vessel model based on penalized splines to overcome the\nlimitations inherent to the centerline representation, such as noise and\nsparsity. The bifurcations are reconstructed using a parametric model based on\nthe anatomy that we extended to planar n-furcations. Finally, we developed a\nmethod to produce a volume mesh with structured, hexahedral, and flow-oriented\ncells from the proposed vascular network model. The proposed method offers\nbetter robustness to the common defects of centerlines and increases the mesh\nquality compared to state-of-the-art methods. As it relies on centerlines\nalone, it can be applied to edit the vascular model effortlessly to study the\nimpact of vascular geometry and topology on hemodynamics. We demonstrate the\nefficiency of our method by entirely meshing a dataset of 60 cerebral vascular\nnetworks. 92% of the vessels and 83% of the bifurcations were meshed without\ndefects needing manual intervention, despite the challenging aspect of the\ninput data.

While\nbindings take effect at run time (of the Python code), the type of the C++\nobjects that are bound must be known when the bindings are generated, that is,\nwhen they are compiled. The types of the bound objects are instances\n(instantiated types) of C++ function and class templates. The number of object\ntypes that can potentially be bound, in implementation of generic\ncomputational-geometry algorithms, is enormous; thus, the generation of the\nbindings for all these types in advance is practically impossible. Often there\nare several choices to make, resulting in a prohibitively large number of\ncombinations. We present a system that rapidly generates bindings for desired\nobject types according to user prescriptions, which enables the convenient use\nof any subset of bound object types concurrently. The introduction of the\nbindings made them easily accessible to newcomers and practitioners in\nnon-computing fields, as we report in the paper.\n",

However, like the Fr\\'echet distance, the DTW distance is\nnot invariant under translations. Can we efficiently optimize the DTW distance\nof $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ under arbitrary translations, to compare the curves'\nshape irrespective of their absolute location?\n  There are surprisingly few works in this direction, which may be due to its\ncomputational intricacy: For the Euclidean norm, this problem contains as a\nspecial case the geometric median problem, which provably admits no exact\nalgebraic algorithm (that is, no algorithm using only addition, multiplication,\nand $k$-th roots). We thus investigate exact algorithms for non-Euclidean norms\nas well as approximation algorithms for the Euclidean norm:\n  - For the $L_1$ norm in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, we provide an\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^{2(d+1)})$-time algorithm, i.e., an exact polynomial-time\nalgorithm for constant $d$.

We then show how to obtain a subcubic\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2.5}/\\varepsilon^2)$ time algorithm with\nsignificant new ideas; this time comes close to the well-known quadratic time\nbarrier for computing DTW for fixed translations. Technically, the algorithm is\nobtained by speeding up repeated DTW distance estimations using a dynamic data\nstructure for maintaining shortest paths in weighted planar digraphs.\nCrucially, we show how to traverse a candidate set of translations using\nspace-filling curves in a way that incurs only few updates to the data\nstructure.\n",

However, computing zigzag\npersistence usually takes considerably more time than the standard persistence.\nWe propose an algorithm called FastZigzag which narrows this efficiency gap.\nOur main result is that an input simplex-wise zigzag filtration can be\nconverted to a cell-wise non-zigzag filtration of a $\\Delta$-complex with the\nsame length, where the cells are copies of the input simplices. This conversion\nstep in FastZigzag incurs very little cost. Furthermore, the barcode of the\noriginal filtration can be easily read from the barcode of the new cell-wise\nfiltration because the conversion embodies a series of diamond switches known\nin topological data analysis. This seemingly simple observation opens up the\nvast possibilities for improving the computation of zigzag persistence because\nany efficient algorithm/software for standard persistence can now be applied to\ncomputing zigzag persistence. Our experiment shows that this indeed achieves\nsubstantial performance gain over the existing state-of-the-art softwares.\n",

A longstanding open\nquestion in Graph Drawing, dating back over 30 years, is whether there exists a\nlinear-time algorithm to compute an orthogonal drawing of a plane 4-graph with\nthe minimum number of bends. The term \"plane\" indicates that the input graph\ncomes together with a planar embedding, which must be preserved by the drawing\n(i.e., the drawing must have the same set of faces as the input graph). In this\npaper, we positively answer the question above for the widely-studied class of\nseries-parallel graphs. Our linear-time algorithm is based on a\ncharacterization of the planar series-parallel graphs that admit an orthogonal\ndrawing without bends. This characterization is given in terms of the\northogonal spirality that each type of triconnected component of the graph can\ntake; the orthogonal spirality of a component measures how much that component\nis \"rolled-up\" in an orthogonal drawing of the graph.\n",

Uncertainty in\nentity locations due to potential motion between queries gives rise to a space\nof possible entity configurations at each moment in time, with possibly very\ndifferent congestion properties. We define different measures of what we call\nthe congestion potential of such spaces, in terms of the (dynamic) intersection\ngraph of the uncertainty regions associated with entities, to describe the\ncongestion that might actually occur.\n  Previous work [SoCG'13, EuroCG'14, SICOMP'16, SODA'19], in the same\nuncertainty model, addressed the problem of minimizing congestion potential\nusing location queries of some bounded frequency.

In their work, Niyogi, Smale, and Weinberger studied samples\nof $C^2$ manifolds with positive reach embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. We extend\ntheir results in the following ways: In the first part of our paper we consider\nboth manifolds of positive reach -- a more general setting than $C^2$ manifolds\n-- and sets of positive reach embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. The sample $P$ of\nsuch a set $\\mathcal{S}$ does not have to lie directly on it. Instead, we\nassume that the two one-sided Hausdorff distances -- $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$\n-- between $P$ and $\\mathcal{S}$ are bounded. We provide explicit bounds in\nterms of $\\varepsilon$ and $ \\delta$, that guarantee that there exists a\nparameter $r$ such that the union of balls of radius $r$ centred at the sample\n$P$ deformation-retracts to $\\mathcal{S}$.\n  In the second part of our paper we study homotopy learning in a significantly\nmore general setting -- we investigate sets of positive reach and submanifolds\nof positive reach embedded in a \\emph{Riemannian manifold with bounded\nsectional curvature}. To this end we introduce a new version of the reach in\nthe Riemannian setting inspired by the cut locus. Yet again, we provide tight\nbounds on $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$ for both cases (submanifolds as well as\nsets of positive reach), exhibiting the tightness by an explicit construction.\n",

In this work, we introduce\nsub-barcodes and show that there is a functor from the category of\nfactorizations of persistence module homomorphisms to a poset of barcodes\nordered by the sub-barcode relation. Sub-barcodes and factorizations provide a\nlooser alternative to bottleneck matchings and interleavings that can give\nstrong guarantees in a number of settings that arise naturally in topological\ndata analysis. The main use of sub-barcodes is to make strong claims about an\nunknown barcode in the absence of an interleaving. For example, given only\nupper and lower bounds $g\\geq f\\geq \\ell$ of an unknown real-valued function\n$f$, a sub-barcode associated with $f$ can be constructed from $\\ell$ and $g$\nalone. We propose a theory of sub-barcodes and observe that the subobjects in\nthe category of functors from intervals to matchings naturally correspond to\nsub-barcodes.\n",

We demonstrate significant improvements through\ncontext-dependent compression on disparate regions within a single image\n(entropy encoding for noisy and predictive encoding for the structured\nregions).

The obstacle number of a graph is the smallest number\nof obstacles in an obstacle representation of the graph in the plane such that\nall obstacles are simple polygons.

Estrada and\nRoss extended these measures to simplicial complexes to account for\nhigher-order connections. In this work, we introduce novel centrality measures\nby leveraging algebraically-computable topological signatures of cycles and\ntheir homological persistence. We apply tools from algebraic topology to\nextract multiscale signatures within cycle spaces of weighted graphs, tracking\nhomology generators persisting across a weight-induced filtration of simplicial\ncomplexes built over point clouds. This approach incorporates persistent\nsignatures and merge information of homology classes along the filtration,\nquantifying cycle importance not only by geometric and topological significance\nbut also by homological influence on other cycles. We demonstrate the stability\nof these measures under small perturbations using an appropriate metric to\nensure robustness in practical applications. Finally, we apply these measures\nto fractal-like point clouds, revealing their capability to detect information\nconsistent with, and possibly overlooked by, common topological summaries.\n",

Formulation of a meaningful\nmeasure of (dis-)similarity in both the combinatorial and geometric structures\nof two such geometric graphs is a challenging problem in pattern recognition.\nWe study two notions of distance measures for geometric graphs, called the\ngeometric edit distance (GED) and geometric graph distance (GGD). While the\nformer is based on the idea of editing one graph to transform it into the other\ngraph, the latter is inspired by inexact matching of the graphs. For decades,\nboth notions have been lending themselves well as measures of similarity\nbetween attributed graphs. If used without any modification, however, they fail\nto provide a meaningful distance measure for geometric graphs -- even cease to\nbe a metric. We have curated their associated cost functions for the context of\ngeometric graphs. Alongside studying the metric properties of GED and GGD, we\ninvestigate how the two notions compare.

Specifically, the point burning process starts with a single\nburnt point from $P$, and at each subsequent step, burns all the points in the\nplane that are within one unit distance from the currently burnt points, as\nwell as one other unburnt point of $P$ (if exists). The point burning number of\n$P$ is the smallest number of steps required to burn all the points of $P$. If\nwe allow the fire to be initiated anywhere, then the burning process is called\nan anywhere burning process, and the corresponding burning number is called\nanywhere burning number. Computing the point and anywhere burning number is\nknown to be NP-hard. In this paper we show that both these problems admit PTAS\nin one dimension. We then show that in two dimensions, point burning and\nanywhere burning are $(1.96296+\\varepsilon)$ and $(1.92188+\\varepsilon)$\napproximable, respectively, for every $\\varepsilon>0$, which improves the\npreviously known $(2+\\varepsilon)$ factor for these problems.

In\nmanufacturing, these patterns can be intentionally introduced as a design\nfeature, or they can be a byproduct of a specific process. Since surface\ntexture has significant impact on the mechanical properties and the longevity\nof the workpiece, it is important to develop tools for quantifying surface\npatterns and, when applicable, comparing them to their nominal counterparts.\nWhile existing tools may be able to indicate the existence of a pattern, they\ntypically do not provide more information about the pattern structure, or how\nmuch it deviates from a nominal pattern. Further, prior works do not provide\nautomatic or algorithmic approaches for quantifying other pattern\ncharacteristics such as depths' consistency, and variations in the pattern\nmotifs at different level sets. This paper leverages persistent homology from\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA) to derive noise-robust scores for quantifying\nmotifs' depth and roundness in a pattern. Specifically, sublevel persistence is\nused to derive scores that quantify the consistency of indentation depths at\nany level set in Piezo Vibration Striking Treatment (PVST) surfaces. Moreover,\nwe combine sublevel persistence with the distance transform to quantify the\nconsistency of the indentation radii, and to compare them with the nominal\nones.

Our main contribution is a general framework for\ndesigning efficient polynomial-time approximation schemes (EPTASes) for\nvertex-deletion problems on disk graphs, which results in EPTASes for many\nproblems including Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Small Cycle Hitting (in\nparticular, Triangle Hitting), $P_k$-Hitting for $k\\in\\{3,4,5\\}$, Path\nDeletion, Pathwidth $1$-Deletion, Component Order Connectivity, Bounded Degree\nDeletion, Pseudoforest Deletion, Finite-Type Component Deletion, etc. All\nEPTASes obtained using our framework are robust in the sense that they do not\nrequire a realization of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, prior\nto this work, the only problems known to admit (E)PTASes on disk graphs are\nMaximum Clique, Independent Set, Dominating set, and Vertex Cover, among which\nthe existing PTAS [Erlebach et al., SICOMP'05] and EPTAS [Leeuwen, SWAT'06] for\nVertex Cover require a realization of the input disk graph (while ours does\nnot).\n  The core of our framework is a reduction for a broad class of (approximation)\nvertex-deletion problems from (general) disk graphs to disk graphs of bounded\nlocal radius, which is a new invariant of disk graphs introduced in this work.\nDisk graphs of bounded local radius can be viewed as a mild generalization of\nplanar graphs, which preserves certain nice properties of planar graphs.\nSpecifically, we prove that disk graphs of bounded local radius admit the\nExcluded Grid Minor property and have locally bounded treewidth. This allows\nexisting techniques for designing approximation schemes on planar graphs (e.g.,\nbidimensionality and Baker's technique) to be directly applied to disk graphs\nof bounded local radius.\n",

We present\nextensive experimental evaluation which shows that in most cases, more than 90%\nof the edges can be removed. In turn, we demonstrate that this often leads to a\nsubstantial speedup, and reduction in the memory usage, of the computational\npipeline of multiparameter topological data analysis.\n",

The first category consists of methods that use\n$\\mathrm{SE}(3)$-convolution which generalizes classical\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution on signals over $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$. Alternatively, it\nis possible to use \\textit{steerable convolution} which achieves\n$\\mathrm{SE}(3)$-equivariance by imposing constraints on\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution of tensor fields. It is known by specialists in the\nfield that the two approaches are equivalent, with steerable convolution being\nthe Fourier transform of $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ convolution. Unfortunately, these\nresults are not widely known and moreover the exact relations between deep\nlearning architectures built upon these two approaches have not been precisely\ndescribed in the literature on equivariant deep learning. In this work we\nprovide an in-depth analysis of both methods and their equivalence and relate\nthe two constructions to multiview convolutional networks.

Specially, our algorithm also supports the\nEuclidean distance, which can handle thin-sheet models (e.g. leaf) and runs\nfaster than the traditional restricted Voronoi diagram~(RVD) algorithm.

In this work, we answer this\nquestion in the affirmative for points on a real line and for points in the\nplane with a bounded geometric spread.\n  For a set $P$ of $n$ points on a line, we show that there exists a dynamic\nalgorithm that maintains a bottleneck matching of $P$ and supports insertion\nand deletion in $O(\\log n)$ time.

Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for\n$k$-clustering of $n$ points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain\ncoresets whose size depends logarithmically in $n$. Moreover, such a dependency\nin $n$ is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in\nthe area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of $n$\n(i.e., ``small'' coresets) for special metrics, like $d$-dimensional Euclidean\nspaces, doubling metrics, metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth, or those\nexcluding a fixed minor.\n  In this paper, we provide the first constructions of small coresets for\n$k$-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs, such as\nEuclidean-weighted Unit Disk/Square Graphs. These constructions follow from a\ngeneral theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric\nsufficient for obtaining small coresets. The proof of our theorem builds on the\nrecent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which\nensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set\nof centers, called ``centroid set''. The main technical contribution of our\nwork is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for\ngraphs that satisfy the two canonical geometric properties.

This problem is computationally challenging, and\nresearchers mainly focus on small-scale instances with the number of circular\nitems n less than 320 in the literature. In this work, we aim to solve this\nproblem on large scale. Specifically, we propose a novel geometric batch\noptimization method that not only can significantly speed up the convergence\nprocess of continuous optimization but also reduce the memory requirement\nduring the program's runtime. Then we propose a heuristic search method, called\nsolution-space exploring and descent, that can discover a feasible solution\nefficiently on large scale. Besides, we propose an adaptive neighbor object\nmaintenance method to maintain the neighbor structure applied in the continuous\noptimization process. In this way, we can find high-quality solutions on large\nscale instances within reasonable computational times. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark instances sampled from n = 300 to 1,000 show that our proposed\nalgorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and performs excellently\non large scale instances. In particular, our algorithm found 10 improved\nsolutions out of the 21 well-studied moderate scale instances and 95 improved\nsolutions out of the 101 sampled large scale instances. Furthermore, our\ngeometric batch optimization, heuristic search, and adaptive maintenance\nmethods are general and can be adapted to other packing and continuous\noptimization problems.\n",

Only recently,\na conditional lower bound (without any restriction to ``combinatorial''\nalgorithms) could be shown for $d=3$ (K\\\"unnemann, FOCS'22). Can this result be\nextended to a tight lower bound for dimensions $d\\ge 4$?\n  In this paper, we formalize the technique of the tight lower bound for $d=3$\nusing a combinatorial object we call prefix covering design. We show that these\ndesigns, which are related in spirit to combinatorial designs, directly\ntranslate to conditional lower bounds for Klee's measure problem and various\nrelated problems. By devising good prefix covering designs, we give the\nfollowing lower bounds for Klee's measure problem in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the depth\nproblem for axis-parallel boxes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the\nlargest-volume/max-perimeter empty (anchored) box problem in $\\mathbb{R}^{2d}$,\nand related problems:\n  - $\\Omega(n^{1.90476})$ for $d=4$,\n  - $\\Omega(n^{2.22222})$ for $d=5$,\n  - $\\Omega(n^{d/3 + 2\\sqrt{d}/9-o(\\sqrt{d})})$ for general $d$,\n  assuming the 3-uniform hyperclique hypothesis. For Klee's measure problem and\nthe depth problem, these bounds improve previous lower bounds of\n$\\Omega(n^{1.777...}), \\Omega(n^{2.0833...})$ and $\\Omega(n^{d/3 + 1/3 +\n\\Theta(1/d)})$ respectively.\n  Our improved prefix covering designs were obtained by (1) exploiting a\ncomputer-aided search using problem-specific insights as well as SAT solvers,\nand (2) showing how to transform combinatorial covering designs known in the\nliterature to strong prefix covering designs. In contrast, we show that our\nlower bounds are close to best possible using this proof technique.\n",

We call a\nfragment happy if any shortest path on the portalgon visits it at most a\nconstant number of times. A portalgon is happy if all of its fragments are\nhappy. We present an efficient algorithm to compute shortest paths on happy\nportalgons. The number of times that a shortest path visits a fragment is\nunbounded in general. We contrast this by showing that the intrinsic Delaunay\ntriangulation of any polyhedral surface corresponds to a happy portalgon. Since\ncomputing the intrinsic Delaunay triangulation may be inefficient, we provide\nan efficient algorithm to compute happy portalgons for a restricted class of\nportalgons.\n",

In the same setting for\nhitting set, we provide a tight $O(\\log N)$-competitive algorithm, assuming\nthat all points have integral coordinates in $[0,N)^{2}$.

In a\nseminal work of Tamassia (SIAM Journal on Computing 1987), a simple\ncombinatorial characterization of angle assignments that can be realized as\nbend-free orthogonal drawings was established, thereby allowing an orthogonal\ndrawing to be described combinatorially by listing the angles of all corners.\nThe characterization reduces the need to consider certain geometric aspects,\nsuch as edge lengths and vertex coordinates, and simplifies the task of graph\ndrawing algorithm design.\n  Barth, Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2017) established an analogous\ncombinatorial characterization for ortho-radial drawings, which are a\ngeneralization of orthogonal drawings to cylindrical grids. The proof of the\ncharacterization is existential and does not result in an efficient algorithm.\nNiedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2019) later addressed this issue by\ndeveloping quadratic-time algorithms for both testing the realizability of a\ngiven angle assignment as an ortho-radial drawing without bends and\nconstructing such a drawing.\n  In this paper, we further improve the time complexity of these tasks to\nnear-linear time.

Motivated by applications in\nDNA-nanotechnology, investigations in algorithmic tile-based self-assembly have\nblossomed into a mature theory with research leveraging tools from\ncomputability theory, complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory\nto develop a wide range of models and show that many are computationally\nuniversal, while also exposing powers and limitations of each. Beyond\ncomputational universality, the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) was shown\nto be intrinsically universal (IU), a strong notion of completeness where a\nsingle tile set is capable of simulating all systems within the model; however,\nthis result required non-deterministic tile attachments. This was later\nconfirmed necessary when it was shown that the class of directed aTAM systems\nis not IU. Building on these results to further investigate the impacts of\nother dynamics, Hader et al. examined several tile-assembly models which varied\nacross (1) the numbers of dimensions used, (2) restrictions based on diffusion\nof tiles through space, and (3) whether each system is directed, and showed\nwhich models are IU. Such results have shed much light on the roles of various\naspects of the dynamics of tile-assembly and their effects on the intrinsic\nuniversality of each model. Here we provide direct comparisons of the various\nmodels by considering intrinsic simulations between models. We show that in\nsome cases one model is more powerful than another, and in others, pairs of\nmodels have mutually exclusive capabilities.

Given an input mesh and\na convex or star-shaped target domain, AFM installs a (possibly refined)\nversion of the input connectivity into the target shape, generating a\npiece-wise linear mapping between them. The algorithm is inspired by the\nadvancing front meshing paradigm, which is revisited to operate on two\nembeddings at once, thus becoming a tool for compatible mesh generation. AFM\nextends the capabilities of existing robust approaches, such as Tutte or\nProgressive Embedding, by providing the same theoretical guarantees of\ninjectivity and at the same time introducing two key advantages: support for a\nbroader set of target domains (star-shaped polygons) and local mesh refinement,\nwhich is used to automatically open the space of solutions in case a valid\nmapping to the target domain does not exist. AFM relies solely on two\ntopological operators (split and flip), and on the computation of segment\nintersections, thus permitting to compute provably injective mappings without\nsolving any numerical problem. This makes the algorithm predictable, easy to\nimplement, debug and deploy. We validated the capabilities of AFM extensively,\nexecuting more than one billion advancing front moves on 36K mapping tasks,\nproving that our theoretical guarantees nicely transition to a robust and\npractical implementation.\n",

A\nkernel range space concerns a set of points $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ and the\nspace of all queries by a fixed kernel (e.g., a Gaussian kernel $K(p,\\cdot) =\n\\exp(-\\|p-\\cdot\\|^2)$). For a point set $X$ of size $n$, a query returns a\nvector of values $R_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, where the $i$th coordinate $(R_p)_i =\nK(p,x_i)$ for $x_i \\in X$.

Therefore, the typical objective is to explore the trade-off between\nupdate time and solution size.

Interpreting each crossing as a cross-cap induces an embedding into a\nnon-orientable surface. In 2007, Mohar showed that the degenerate crossing\nnumber of a graph is at most its non-orientable genus and he conjectured that\nthese quantities are equal for every graph. He also made the stronger\nconjecture that this also holds for any loopless pseudotriangulation with a\nfixed embedding scheme.\n  In this paper, we prove a structure theorem that almost completely classifies\nthe loopless 2-vertex embedding schemes for which the degenerate crossing\nnumber equals the non-orientable genus. In particular, we provide a\ncounterexample to Mohar's stronger conjecture, but show that in the vast\nmajority of the 2-vertex cases, the conjecture does hold.\n  The reversal distance between two signed permutations is the minimum number\nof reversals that transform one permutation to the other one. If we represent\nthe trajectory of each element of a signed permutation under successive\nreversals by a simple arc, we obtain a drawing of a 2-vertex embedding scheme\nwith degenerate crossings. Our main result is proved by leveraging this\nconnection and a classical result in genome rearrangement (the\nHannenhali-Pevzner algorithm) and can also be understood as an extension of\nthis algorithm when the reversals do not necessarily happen in a monotone\norder.\n",

In the case\nof finitely presented bi-persistence modules, all the available methods to\ncompute the matching distance are based on restricting the computation to lines\nthrough pairs from a finite set of points in the plane. Some of these points\nare determined by the filtration data as they are entrance values of critical\nsimplices. However, these critical values alone are not sufficient for the\nmatching distance computation and it is necessary to add so-called switch\npoints, i.e. points such that on a line through any of them, the bottleneck\nmatching switches the matched pair.\n  This paper is devoted to the algorithmic computation of the set of switch\npoints given a set of critical values. We find conditions under which a\ncandidate switch point is erroneous or superfluous. The obtained conditions are\nturned into algorithms that have been implemented. With this, we analyze how\nthe size of the set of switch points increases as the number of critical values\nincreases, and how it varies depending on the distribution of critical values.\nExperiments are carried out on various types of bi-persistence modules.\n",

The interleaving distance, in\nturn, is a common distance for comparing merge trees. However, the interleaving\ndistance for merge trees is solely based on the hierarchical structure, and\ndisregards any other geometrical or topological properties that might be\npresent in the underlying data. Furthermore, the interleaving distance is\nNP-hard to compute. In this paper, we introduce a form of ordered merge trees\nthat can capture intrinsic order present in the data. We further define a\nnatural variant of the interleaving distance, the monotone interleaving\ndistance, which is an order-preserving distance for ordered merge trees.\nAnalogously to the regular interleaving distance for merge trees, we show that\nthe monotone variant has three equivalent definitions in terms of two maps, a\nsingle map, or a labelling. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the\nmonotone interleaving distance of ordered merge trees and the Fr\\'echet\ndistance of 1D curves. As a result, the monotone interleaving distance between\ntwo ordered merge trees can be computed exactly in near-quadratic time in their\ncomplexity. The connection between the monotone interleaving distance and the\nFr\\'echet distance builds a new bridge between the fields of topological data\nanalysis, where interleaving distances are a common tool, and computational\ngeometry, where Fr\\'echet distances are studied extensively.\n",

In general, $T$ will only be an\napproximate tiling, due to the presence of gaps and overlaps between the\nperturbed polygons in $T$. The areas of these gaps and overlaps are typically\nsmall relative to the areas of the polygons themselves.\n  Suppose that we are given the approximate tiling $T$ and we wish to recover\nthe tiling $T^*$. To address this problem, we introduce a new algorithm, called\n{\\tt smart\\_repair}, to modify the polygons in $T$ to produce a tiling\n$\\widetilde{T} = \\{\\widetilde{P}_1, \\ldots, \\widetilde{P}_N\\}$ that closely\napproximates $T^*$, with special attention given to reproducing the {\\em\nadjacency relations} between the polygons in $T^*$ as closely as possible.\n  The motivation for this algorithm comes from computational redistricting,\nwhere algorithms are used to build districts from smaller geographic units.\nBecause districts in most U.S. states are required to be contiguous, these\nalgorithms are fundamentally based on adjacency relations between units.\nUnfortunately, the best available map data for unit boundaries is often noisy,\ncontaining gaps and overlaps between units that can lead to substantial\ninaccuracies in the adjacency relations. Simple repair algorithms can\nexacerbate these inaccuracies, with the result that algorithmically drawn\ndistricts based on the ``repaired\" units may be discontiguous, and hence not\nlegally compliant.

Our method\nconstructs a spanning tree and a rotation system. Since the tree is trivially a\nplanar graph, its rotation system determines a genus zero surface with a single\nface which we proceed to incrementally refine by inserting edges to split faces\nand thus merging them. In order to raise the genus, special handles are added\nby inserting edges between different faces and thus merging them. We apply our\nmethod to a wide range of input point clouds in order to investigate its\neffectiveness, and we compare our method to several other surface\nreconstruction methods. We find that our method offers better control over\noutlier classification, i.e. which points to include in the reconstructed\nsurface, and also more control over the topology of the reconstructed surface.\n",

In this paper, we study what happens if we are allowed to\nintroduce $k$ Steiner points to reduce the spanner complexity. We study such\nSteiner spanners in simple polygons, polygonal domains, and edge-weighted\ntrees. We show that Steiner points have only limited utility.

Arrangements of pseudolines (and in particular arrangements of\nlines) are important objects appearing in many forms in discrete and\ncomputational geometry.

Let $B_n$ be the number of\nnon-isomorphic pseudoline arrangements of order $n$ and let $b_n :=\n\\log_2(B_n)$.

Both the upper and the lower bound\nhave been improved a couple of times since.

In the literature,\nsolutions exist supporting the insertion and deletion of points in\npoly-logarithmic time and various queries on the convex hull of the current set\nof points in logarithmic time. If arbitrary insertion and deletion of points\nare allowed, constant time updates and fast queries are known to be impossible.\nThis paper considers two restricted cases where worst-case constant time\nupdates and logarithmic time queries are possible. We assume all updates are\nperformed on a deque (double-ended queue) of points. The first case considers\nthe monotonic path case, where all points are sorted in a given direction, say\nhorizontally left-to-right, and only the leftmost and rightmost points can be\ninserted and deleted. The second case assumes that the points in the deque\nconstitute a simple path. Note that the monotone case is a special case of the\nsimple path case. For both cases, we present solutions supporting deque\ninsertions and deletions in worst-case constant time and standard queries on\nthe convex hull of the points in $O(\\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of\npoints in the current point set. The convex hull of the current point set can\nbe reported in $O(h+\\log n)$ time, where $h$ is the number of edges of the\nconvex hull. For the 1-sided monotone path case, where updates are only allowed\non one side, the reporting time can be reduced to $O(h)$, and queries on the\nconvex hull are supported in $O(\\log h)$ time. All our time bounds are worst\ncase. In addition, we prove lower bounds that match these time bounds, and thus\nour results are optimal. For a quick comparison, the previous best update\nbounds for the simple path problem were amortized $O(\\log n)$ time by Friedman,\nHershberger, and Snoeyink [SoCG 1989].\n",

For piecewise-linear (PL) bivariate fields, the Reeb spaces are\n$2$-dimensional polyhedrons while for PL scalar fields, the Reeb graphs (or\nReeb spaces) are of dimension $1$. Efficient algorithms have been designed for\ncomputing Reeb graphs, however, computing correct Reeb spaces for PL bivariate\nfields, is a challenging open problem. In the current paper, we propose a novel\nalgorithm for fast and correct computation of the Reeb space corresponding to a\ngeneric PL bivariate field defined on a triangulation $\\mathbb{M}$ of a\n$3$-manifold without boundary, leveraging the fast algorithms for computing\nReeb graphs in the literature.\n  Our algorithm is based on the computation of a Multi-Dimensional Reeb Graph\n(MDRG) which is first proved to be homeomorphic with the Reeb space. For the\ncorrect computation of the MDRG, we compute the Jacobi set of the PL bivariate\nfield and its projection into the Reeb space, called the Jacobi structure.\nFinally, the correct Reeb space is obtained by computing a net-like structure\nembedded in the Reeb space and then computing its $2$-sheets in the net-like\nstructure. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 +\nn(c_{int})\\log (n) + nc_L^2)$, where $n$ is the total number of simplices in\n$\\mathbb{M}$, $c_{int}$ is the number of intersections of the projections of\nthe non-adjacent Jacobi set edges on the range of the bivariate field and $c_L$\nis the upper bound on the number of simplices in the link of an edge of\n$\\mathbb{M}$. This complexity is comparable with the fastest algorithm\navailable in the literature. Moreover, we claim to provide the first algorithm\nto compute the topologically correct Reeb space without using range\nquantization.\n",

The geometric 3SUM-hard problems have\nwidely been studied in computational geometry and recently, these problems have\nbeen examined under the quantum computing model. For example, Ambainis and\nLarka [TQC'20] designed a quantum algorithm that can solve many geometric\n3SUM-hard problems in $O(n^{1+o(1)})$-time, whereas Buhrman [ITCS'22]\ninvestigated lower bounds under quantum 3SUM conjecture that claims there does\nnot exist any sublinear $O(n^{1-\\delta})$-time quantum algorithm for the 3SUM\nproblem. The main idea of Ambainis and Larka is to formulate a 3SUM-hard\nproblem as a search problem, where one needs to find a point with a certain\nproperty over a set of regions determined by a line arrangement in the plane.\nThe quantum speed-up then comes from the application of the well-known quantum\nsearch technique called Grover search over all regions.\n  This paper further generalizes the technique of Ambainis and Larka for some\n3SUM-hard problems when a solution may not necessarily correspond to a single\npoint or the search regions do not immediately correspond to the subdivision\ndetermined by a line arrangement.

Previous work showed that for any constant\n$\\epsilon\\in (0,1)$, one could construct a $(2+\\epsilon)$-spanner with\n$O(n\\log(n))$ edges (SICOMP 2019), and there is a lower bound of $\\Omega(n^2)$\nedges for any $(2-\\epsilon)$-spanner (SoCG 2015). The main open question is\nwhether a linear number of edges suffices and the stretch can be reduced to\n$2$. We resolve this problem by showing that for stretch $2$, one needs\n$\\Omega(n\\log n)$ edges, and for stretch $2+\\epsilon$ for any fixed $\\epsilon\n\\in (0,1)$, $O(n)$ edges are sufficient. Our lower bound is the first\nsuper-linear lower bound for stretch $2$.\n  En route to achieve our result, we introduce the problem of constructing\nnon-Steiner tree covers for metrics, which is a natural variant of the\nwell-known Steiner point removal problem for trees (SODA 2001). Given a tree\nand a set of terminals in the tree, our goal is to construct a collection of a\nsmall number of dominating trees such that for every two points, at least one\ntree in the collection preserves their distance within a small stretch factor.\nHere, we identify an unexpected threshold phenomenon around $2$ where a sharp\ntransition from $n$ trees to $\\Theta(\\log n)$ trees and then to $O(1)$ trees\nhappens. Specifically, (i) for stretch $ 2-\\epsilon$, one needs $\\Omega(n)$\ntrees; (ii) for stretch $2$, $\\Theta(\\log n)$ tree is necessary and sufficient;\nand (iii) for stretch $2+\\epsilon$, a constant number of trees suffice.\nFurthermore, our lower bound technique for the non-Steiner tree covers of\nstretch $2$ has further applications in proving lower bounds for two related\nconstructions in tree metrics: reliable spanners and locality-sensitive\norderings. Our lower bound for locality-sensitive orderings matches the best\nupper bound (STOC 2022).\n",

We grow the\nboxes non-uniformly and asymmetrically in different dimensions based on the\ndistribution of points. We present two approaches to handle the boxes: a point\ncover where each point is assigned its own box at start, and a pixel cover that\nworks with a pixelization of the space of the PCD. Any box cover in either\nsetting automatically gives a mapper of the PCD. We show that the persistence\ndiagrams generated by the box filtration using both point and pixel covers\nsatisfy the classical stability based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Using\nboxes also implies that the box filtration is identical for pairwise or higher\norder intersections whereas the VR and Cech filtration are not the same.\n  Growth in each dimension is computed by solving a linear program (LP) that\noptimizes a cost functional balancing the cost of expansion and benefit of\nincluding more points in the box. The box filtration algorithm runs in\n$O(m|U(0)|\\log(mn\\pi)L(q))$ time, where $m$ is number of steps of increments\nconsidered for box growth, $|U(0)|$ is the number of boxes in the initial cover\n($\\leq$ number of points), $\\pi$ is the step length for increasing each box\ndimension, each LP is solved in $O(L(q))$ time, $n$ is the PCD dimension, and\n$q = n \\times |X|$.

Slat-based self-assembly is a recent development wherein DNA forms\nlong slats that combine together in 2 layers, rather than the aTAM's square\ntiles in a plane. While tiles tend to bind to 2 neighboring tiles at a time,\nslats may bind to dozens of other slats. Large slat-based DNA constructions\nhave been implemented in the lab with incredible resilience to many of the\nerrors that plague tile-based constructions, but these come at a cost as\nslat-based systems are often more difficult to design and simulate. Also, it\nhas not been clear if slats, with their larger sizes and different geometries,\nhave the same theoretical capabilities as tiles. Here we show that slats do, at\nleast at scale. We give constructions showing that any aTAM system may be\nsimulated by a system of slats and that these can be made more efficiently,\nusing shorter slats and a smaller scale factor, when simulating simpler classes\nof systems. We consider 5 classes of aTAM systems with increasing complexity,\nfrom zig-zag systems to the full class of all aTAM systems, and show how they\ncan be converted to equivalent slat systems. Zig-zag systems can be simulated\nby slats at only a $2c \\times 2c$ scale (where $c$ is the freely chosen\ncooperativity of the slats), the full class of aTAM systems at only a $5c\n\\times 5c$ scale, and intermediate classes using scales between these.\nTogether, these results prove that slats have the full theoretical power of\naTAM tiles while providing constructions compact enough to potentially provide\ndesigns for DNA-based implementations of slat systems that are both capable of\npowerful algorithmic self-assembly and possessing the strong error resilience\nof slats.\n",

The idea is that the geometric properties of the projected\nmanifolds are helpful in the inference of graph properties. However, if the\nchoice of the embedding manifold is incorrectly performed, it can lead to\nincorrect geometric inference. In this paper, we argue that the classical\nembedding techniques cannot lead to correct geometric interpretation as they\nmiss the curvature at each point, of manifold. We advocate that for doing\ncorrect geometric interpretation the embedding of graph should be done over\nregular constant curvature manifolds. To this end, we present an embedding\napproach, the discrete Ricci flow graph embedding (dRfge) based on the discrete\nRicci flow that adapts the distance between nodes in a graph so that the graph\ncan be embedded onto a constant curvature manifold that is homogeneous and\nisotropic, i.e., all directions are equivalent and distances comparable,\nresulting in correct geometric interpretations. A major contribution of this\npaper is that for the first time, we prove the convergence of discrete Ricci\nflow to a constant curvature and stable distance metrics over the edges. A\ndrawback of using the discrete Ricci flow is the high computational complexity\nthat prevented its usage in large-scale graph analysis. Another contribution of\nthis paper is a new algorithmic solution that makes it feasible to calculate\nthe Ricci flow for graphs of up to 50k nodes, and beyond. The intuitions behind\nthe discrete Ricci flow make it possible to obtain new insights into the\nstructure of large-scale graphs.

The two most basic \"compactness'' measures of a\nEuclidean spanner $E$ are the size (number of edges) $|E|$ and the weight (sum\nof edge weights) $\\|E\\|$. In this paper, we initiate the study of instance\noptimal Euclidean spanners. Our results are two-fold.\n  We demonstrate that the greedy spanner is far from being instance optimal,\neven when allowing its stretch to grow. More concretely, we design two hard\ninstances of point sets in the plane, where the greedy $(1+x \\epsilon)$-spanner\n(for basically any parameter $x \\geq 1$) has $\\Omega_x(\\epsilon^{-1/2}) \\cdot\n|E_\\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $\\Omega_x(\\epsilon^{-1}) \\cdot\n\\|E_\\mathrm{light}\\|$, where $E_\\mathrm{spa}$ and $E_\\mathrm{light}$ denote the\nper-instance sparsest and lightest $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanners, respectively, and\nthe $\\Omega_x$ notation suppresses a polynomial dependence on $1/x$.\n  As our main contribution, we design a new construction of Euclidean spanners,\nwhich is inherently different from known constructions, achieving the following\nbounds: a stretch of $1+\\epsilon\\cdot 2^{O(\\log^*(d/\\epsilon))}$ with $O(1)\n\\cdot |E_\\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $O(1) \\cdot \\|E_\\mathrm{light}\\|$. In\nother words, we show that a slight increase to the stretch suffices for\nobtaining instance optimality up to an absolute constant for both sparsity and\nlightness. Remarkably, there is only a log-star dependence on the dimension in\nthe stretch, and there is no dependence on it whatsoever in the number of edges\nand weight.\n",

A $d$-realization of $(G,\\ell)$ is an assignment of points\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to the vertices of $G$ for which pair-wise distances between\npoints agree with $\\ell$. For $d \\leq 3$, we characterize pairs $(G,f)$, where\n$f$ is a nonedge of $G$, such that, for any squared edge-length map $\\ell$,\nthere is a single interval of attained distance values between the endpoints of\n$f$ over all $d$-realizations of $(G,\\ell)$, answering a question posed in\n\\cite{sitharam2010characterizing} a decade ago, which gave an equivalent\ncharacterization for $d\\le 2$ that does not generalize to $d\\ge 3$. Two notable\nbyproducts of this characterization are a new tool for partial $3$-tree\ncompletion, a well-studied problem, and a deeper understanding of the\nrealization space of partial $3$-tree linkages through the lens of Cayley\nrealization spaces. Although related to the minor closed class of\n$3$-flattenable graphs, the class of pairs $(G,f)$ with the above property is\nnot minor closed, has no obvious well quasi-ordering, and there are infinitely\nmany minimal graphs-nonedge pairs - w.r.t. edge contractions - in the\ncomplement class. Our characterization overcomes these obstacles, is based on\nthe forbidden minors of the class of $3$-flattenable graphs, and contributes to\nthe theory of Cayley configurations used for analyzing distance-constrained\nconfiguration spaces in a range of application domains.

An active frontier in\nrepresentation learning is understanding representations for combinatorial\nstructures which may not admit well-behaved local neighborhoods or distance\nfunctions. For example, for polygons, slightly perturbing vertex locations\nmight lead to significant changes in their combinatorial structure and may even\nlead to invalid polygons. In this paper, we investigate representations to\ncapture the underlying combinatorial structures of polygons. Specifically, we\nstudy the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph\nG, construct a polygon P whose visibility graph is G.\n  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to reconstruct a\npolygon from its given visibility graph G. Our method first estimates the\nsigned distance function (SDF) of P from G. Afterwards, it extracts ordered\nvertex locations that have the pairwise visibility relationship given by the\nedges of G. Our main insight is that going through the SDF significantly\nimproves learning for reconstruction. In order to train VisDiff, we make two\nmain contributions: (1) We design novel loss components for computing the\nvisibility in a differentiable manner and (2) create a carefully curated\ndataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 21%\nimprovement in F1-Score over standard methods. We also demonstrate effective\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution polygon types and show that learning a\ngenerative model allows us to sample the set of polygons with a given\nvisibility graph. Finally, we extend our method to the related combinatorial\nproblem of reconstruction from a triangulation.

Given a graph $G$ and\nan integer $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ as input, the goal is to determine whether we can\nperform at most $k$ operations on $G$ to transform it into a graph belonging to\na specified graph class $\\mathcal{F}$. Typical operations are combinatorial and\ninclude vertex deletions and edge deletions, insertions, and contractions.\nHowever, in many real-world scenarios, when the input graph is constrained to\nbe a geometric intersection graph, the modification of the graph is influenced\nby changes in the geometric properties of the underlying objects themselves,\nrather than by combinatorial modifications. It raises the question of whether\nvertex deletions or adjacency modifications are necessarily the most\nappropriate modification operations for studying modifications of geometric\ngraphs.\n  We propose the study of the disk intersection graph modification through the\nscaling of disks. This operation is typical in the realm of topology control\nbut has not yet been explored in the context of Parameterized Complexity. We\ndesign parameterized algorithms and kernels for modifying to the most basic\ngraph classes: edgeless, connected, and acyclic. Our technical contributions\nencompass a novel combination of linear programming, branching, and\nkernelization techniques, along with a fresh application of bidimensionality\ntheory to analyze the area covered by disks, which may have broader\napplicability.\n",

Joss and Shannon proved in 1973 that a\nsequence of flipturns eventually transforms any simple polygon into a convex\npolygon. This paper describes several new results about such flipturn\nsequences. We show that any orthogonal polygon is convexified after at most n-5\narbitrary flipturns, or at most 5(n-4)/6 well-chosen flipturns, improving the\npreviously best upper bound of (n-1)!/2. We also show that any simple polygon\ncan be convexified by at most n^2-4n+1 flipturns, generalizing earlier results\nof Ahn et al. These bounds depend critically on how degenerate cases are\nhandled; we carefully explore several possibilities. We describe how to\nmaintain both a simple polygon and its convex hull in O(log^4 n) time per\nflipturn, using a data structure of size O(n). We show that although flipturn\nsequences for the same polygon can have very different lengths, the shape and\nposition of the final convex polygon is the same for all sequences and can be\ncomputed in O(n log n) time.

        "summary": "  Starting with a similarity function between objects, it is possible to define\na distance metric on pairs of objects, and more generally on probability\ndistributions over them. These distance metrics have a deep basis in functional\nanalysis, measure theory and geometric measure theory, and have a rich\nstructure that includes an isometric embedding into a (possibly infinite\ndimensional) Hilbert space. They have recently been applied to numerous\nproblems in machine learning and shape analysis.\n  In this paper, we provide the first algorithmic analysis of these distance\nmetrics. Our main contributions are as follows: (i) We present fast\napproximation algorithms for computing the kernel distance between two point\nsets P and Q that runs in near-linear time in the size of (P cup Q) (note that\nan explicit calculation would take quadratic time). (ii) We present\npolynomial-time algorithms for approximately minimizing the kernel distance\nunder rigid transformation; they run in time O(n + poly(1/epsilon, log n)).\n(iii) We provide several general techniques for reducing complex objects to\nconvenient sparse representations (specifically to point sets or sets of points\nsets) which approximately preserve the kernel distance. In particular, this\nallows us to reduce problems of computing the kernel distance between various\ntypes of objects such as curves, surfaces, and distributions to computing the\nkernel distance between point sets. These take advantage of the reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space and a new relation linking binary range spaces to\ncontinuous range spaces with bounded fat-shattering dimension.\n",

Natural roads\nare joined road segments that perceptually constitute good continuity. This\napproach relies on the connectivity of natural roads rather than that of road\nsegments for computing routes or map directions. Because of this, the derived\nroutes posses the fewest turns. However, what we intend to achieve are the\nroutes that not only possess the fewest turns, but are also as short as\npossible. This kind of map direction is more effective and favorable by people,\nbecause they bear less cognitive burden. Furthermore, the computation of the\nroutes is more efficient, since it is based on the graph encoding the\nconnectivity of roads, which is significantly smaller than the graph of road\nsegments. We made experiments applied to eight urban street networks from North\nAmerica and Europe in order to illustrate the above stated advantages. The\nexperimental results indicate that the fewest-turn routes posses fewer turns\nand shorter distances than the simplest paths and the routes provided by Google\nMaps. For example, the fewest-turn-and-shortest routes are on average 15%\nshorter than the routes suggested by Google Maps, while the number of turns is\njust half as much. This approach is a key technology behind FromToMap.org - a\nweb mapping service using openstreetmap data.\n",

However, there is\nevidence that the special case when the ambient manifold is R^3, or more\ngenerally when the second homology is trivial, should be considerably more\ntractable.

Locally computed persistence information is then merged from\nthe components and their intersections using a spectral sequence generalizing\nthe Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence.\n  We describe the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence and give details on how to\ncompute with it. This allows us to merge local homological data into the global\npersistent homology. Furthermore, we detail how the classical topology\nconstructions inherent in the spectral sequence adapt to a persistence\nperspective, as well as describe the techniques from computational commutative\nalgebra necessary for this extension.\n  The resulting computational scheme suggests a parallelization scheme, and we\ndiscuss the communication steps involved in this scheme.

A kernel density estimate of a distribution is the convolution\nof that distribution with a fixed kernel (e.g. Gaussian kernel). Given a subset\n(i.e. a point set) of the input distribution, we can compare the kernel density\nestimates of the input distribution with that of the subset and bound the worst\ncase error. If the maximum error is eps, then this subset can be thought of as\nan eps-sample (aka an eps-approximation) of the range space defined with the\ninput distribution as the ground set and the fixed kernel representing the\nfamily of ranges. Interestingly, in this case the ranges are not binary, but\nhave a continuous range (for simplicity we focus on kernels with range of\n[0,1]); these allow for smoother notions of range spaces.\n  It turns out, the use of this smoother family of range spaces has an added\nbenefit of greatly decreasing the size required for eps-samples. For instance,\nin the plane the size is O((1/eps^{4/3}) log^{2/3}(1/eps)) for disks (based on\nVC-dimension arguments) but is only O((1/eps) sqrt{log (1/eps)}) for Gaussian\nkernels and for kernels with bounded slope that only affect a bounded domain.\nThese bounds are accomplished by studying the discrepancy of these \"kernel\"\nrange spaces, and here the improvement in bounds are even more pronounced. In\nthe plane, we show the discrepancy is O(sqrt{log n}) for these kernels, whereas\nfor balls there is a lower bound of Omega(n^{1/4}).\n",

Tokuyama introduced \"implicit computational geometry\", in which the\ngeometric objects are defined by implicit relations involving sets. An\nimportant member in this family is called \"a zone diagram\". The implicit nature\nof zone diagrams implies, as already observed in the original works, that their\ncomputation is a challenging task. In a continuous setting this task has been\naddressed (briefly) only by these authors in the Euclidean plane with point\nsites. We discuss the possibility to compute zone diagrams in a wide class of\nspaces and also shed new light on their computation in the original setting.\nThe class of spaces, which is introduced here, includes, in particular,\nEuclidean spheres and finite dimensional strictly convex normed spaces. Sites\nof a general form are allowed and it is shown that a generalization of the\niterative method suggested by Asano, Matousek and Tokuyama converges to a\ndouble zone diagram, another implicit geometric object whose existence is known\nin general. Occasionally a zone diagram can be obtained from this procedure.\nThe actual (approximate) computation of the iterations is based on a simple\nalgorithm which enables the approximate computation of Voronoi diagrams in a\ngeneral setting. Our analysis also yields a few byproducts of independent\ninterest, such as certain topological properties of Voronoi cells (e.g., that\nin the considered setting their boundaries cannot be \"fat\").\n",

Conformal mappings\nhave been widely used to obtain a diffeomorphism between shapes that minimizes\nangular distortion. Conformal registrations are beneficial since it preserves\nthe local geometry well. However, when landmark constraints are enforced,\nconformal mappings generally do not exist. This motivates us to look for a\nunique landmark matching quasi-conformal registration, which minimizes the\nconformality distortion. Under suitable condition on the landmark constraints,\na unique diffeomporphism, called the Teichm\\\"uller extremal mapping between two\nsurfaces can be obtained, which minimizes the maximal conformality distortion.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, called the\nQuasi-conformal (QC) iterations, to compute the Teichm\\\"uller mapping. The\nbasic idea is to represent the set of diffeomorphisms using Beltrami\ncoefficients (BCs), and look for an optimal BC associated to the desired\nTeichm\\\"uller mapping. The associated diffeomorphism can be efficiently\nreconstructed from the optimal BC using the Linear Beltrami Solver(LBS). Using\nBCs to represent diffeomorphisms guarantees the diffeomorphic property of the\nregistration. Using our proposed method, the Teichm\\\"uller mapping can be\naccurately and efficiently computed within 10 seconds. The obtained\nregistration is guaranteed to be bijective. The proposed algorithm can also be\nextended to compute Teichm\\\"uller mapping with soft landmark constraints. We\napplied the proposed algorithm to real applications, such as brain landmark\nmatching registration, constrained texture mapping and human face registration.\nExperimental results shows that our method is both effective and efficient in\ncomputing a non-overlap landmark matching registration with least amount of\nconformality distortion.\n",

It was observed previously that contracting edges that satisfy the so\ncalled link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional complexes, and\nhomotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation in\nall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\ncomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link\ncondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We\nprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and\n(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional\nhomology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the\n(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not\nintroduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,\nthough some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, the\nsurjection in relative homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relative\ntorsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link condition\nalone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and the\np-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology and\nrelative torsion are motivated by recent results on computing optimal\nhomologous chains, which state that such problems can be solved by linear\nprogramming if the complex has no relative torsion. Edge contractions that do\nnot introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts.\n",

In the field of\ncomputational anatomy, the framework of currents has indeed proved very\nefficient to model a wide variety of shapes. However, in such approaches,\norientation of shapes is a fundamental issue that can lead to several drawbacks\nin treating certain kind of datasets. More specifically, problems occur with\nstructures like acute pikes because of canceling effects of currents or with\ndata that consists in many disconnected pieces like fiber bundles for which\ncurrents require a consistent orientation of all pieces. As a promising\nalternative to currents, varifolds, introduced in the context of geometric\nmeasure theory by F. Almgren, allow the representation of any non-oriented\nmanifold (more generally any non-oriented rectifiable set). In particular, we\nexplain how varifolds can encode numerically non-oriented objects both from the\ndiscrete and continuous point of view. We show various ways to build a Hilbert\nspace structure on the set of varifolds based on the theory of reproducing\nkernels. We show that, unlike the currents' setting, these metrics are\nconsistent with shape volume (theorem 4.1) and we derive a formula for the\nvariation of metric with respect to the shape (theorem 4.2).

The\nproblem is known to be NP-hard, and its inherent continuous structure (with\nboth the set of points that need to be guarded and the set of points that can\nbe used for guarding being uncountably infinite) makes it difficult to apply a\nstraightforward formulation as an Integer Linear Program. We use an iterative\nprimal-dual relaxation approach for solving AGP instances to optimality. At\neach stage, a pair of LP relaxations for a finite candidate subset of primal\ncovering and dual packing constraints and variables is considered; these\ncorrespond to possible guard positions and points that are to be guarded.\n  Particularly useful are cutting planes for eliminating fractional solutions.\nWe identify two classes of facets, based on Edge Cover and Set Cover (SC)\ninequalities. Solving the separation problem for the latter is NP-complete, but\nexploiting the underlying geometric structure, we show that large subclasses of\nfractional SC solutions cannot occur for the AGP. This allows us to separate\nthe relevant subset of facets in polynomial time. We also characterize all\nfacets for finite AGP relaxations with coefficients in {0, 1, 2}.\n  Finally, we demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach. Our cutting\nplane technique yields a significant improvement in terms of speed and solution\nquality due to considerably reduced integrality gaps as compared to the\napproach by Kr\\\"oller et al.\n",

One standard method for choosing $k$ sources, which has been used\nextensively and successfully for isometry-invariant surface processing, is the\nso-called Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), which starts with a random vertex as\nthe first source, and iteratively selects the farthest vertex from the already\nselected sources.\n  In this paper, we analyze the stretch factor $\\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ of\napproximate geodesics computed using FPS, which is the maximum, over all pairs\nof distinct vertices, of their approximated distance over their geodesic\ndistance in the graph.

QCMC\ncomputes a quasi-conformal map from a multiply-connected domain $S$ onto a\npunctured disk $D_S$ associated with a given Beltrami differential. The\nBeltrami differential, which measures the conformality distortion, is a\ncomplex-valued function $\\mu:S\\to\\mathbb{C}$ with supremum norm strictly less\nthan 1. Every Beltrami differential gives a conformal structure of $S$. Hence,\nthe conformal module of $D_S$, which are the radii and centers of the inner\ncircles, can be fully determined by $\\mu$, up to a M\\\"obius transformation. In\nthis paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to simultaneously search for the\nconformal module and the optimal quasi-conformal parameterization. The key idea\nis to minimize the Beltrami energy subject to the boundary constraints. The\noptimal solution is our desired quasi-conformal parameterization onto a\npunctured disk. The parameterization of the multiply-connected domain\nsimplifies numerical computations and has important applications in various\nfields, such as in computer graphics and vision.

We focus on the case of linear programs (LPs) in dictionary form,\ngiven by $n$ equality constraints in $n+d$ variables, where the variables are\nconstrained to be nonnegative. A variable $x_r$ is called redundant, if after\nremoving $x_r \\geq 0$ the LP still has the same feasible region. The time\nneeded to solve such an LP is denoted by $LP(n,d)$.\n  It is easy to see that solving $n+d$ LPs of the above size is sufficient to\ndetect all redundancies. The currently fastest practical method is the one by\nClarkson: it solves $n+d$ linear programs, but each of them has at most $s$\nvariables, where $s$ is the number of nonredundant constraints.\n  In the first part we show that knowing all of the finitely many dictionaries\nof the LP is sufficient for the purpose of redundancy detection. A dictionary\nis a matrix that can be thought of as an enriched encoding of a vertex in the\nLP. Moreover - and this is the combinatorial aspect - it is enough to know only\nthe signs of the entries, the actual values do not matter. Concretely we show\nthat for any variable $x_r$ one can find a dictionary, such that its sign\npattern is either a redundancy or nonredundancy certificate for $x_r$.\n  In the second part we show that considering only the sign patterns of the\ndictionary, there is an output sensitive algorithm of running time\n$\\mathcal{O}(d \\cdot (n+d) \\cdot s^{d-1} \\cdot LP(s,d) + d \\cdot s^{d} \\cdot\nLP(n,d))$ to detect all redundancies.

We consider two main applications, where we obtain (weakly) total\npolynomial-time algorithms: Signed Minkowski sums of convex polytopes, where\npolytopes can be subtracted provided the signed sum is a convex polytope, and\ncomputation of secondary, resultant, and discriminant polytopes. Further\napplications include convex combinatorial optimization and convex integer\nprogramming, where we offer a new approach, thus removing the complexity's\nexponential dependence in the dimension.\n",

This task can be simplified with the\naid of a parameterization. In particular, conformal parameterizations are\nadvantageous in preserving the geometric information of the point cloud data.\nIn this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art spherical conformal\nparameterization algorithm for genus-0 closed meshes to the case of point\nclouds, using an improved approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on\ndata points. Then, we propose an iterative scheme called the North-South\nreiteration for achieving a spherical conformal parameterization.

High quality triangulations and quadrangulations can then be\nbuilt on the point clouds with the aid of the parameterizations. Also, the\nmeshes generated are guaranteed to be genus-0 closed meshes.

Given a (topologically open) polygon $C$ and a finite set $P$ of\npoints in general position in the complement of $C$, the visibility graph\n$G_C(P)$ has a vertex for each point in $P$ and an edge $pq$ for any two points\n$p$ and $q$ in $P$ that can see each other, that is, $\\overline{pq} \\cap\nC=\\emptyset$. We draw $G_C(P)$ straight-line. Given a graph $G$, we want to\ncompute an obstacle representation of $G$, that is, an obstacle $C$ and a set\nof points $P$ such that $G=G_C(P)$. The complexity of this problem is open,\neven for the case that the points are exactly the vertices of a simple polygon\nand the obstacle is the complement of the polygon-the simple-polygon visibility\ngraph problem. There are two types of obstacles; an inside obstacle lies in a\nbounded component of the complement of the visibility drawing, whereas an\noutside obstacle lies in the unbounded component.\n  We show that the class of graphs with an inside-obstacle representation is\nincomparable with the class of graphs that have an outside-obstacle\nrepresentation. We further show that any graph with at most seven vertices or\ncircumference at most 6 has an outside-obstacle representation, which does not\nhold for a specific graph with 8 vertices and circumference 8. Finally, we\nconsider the outside-obstacle graph sandwich problem: given graphs $G$ and $H$\non the same vertex set, is there a graph $K$ such that $G \\subseteq K \\subseteq\nH$ and $K$ has an outside-obstacle representation? We show that this problem is\nNP-hard even for co-bipartite graphs. With slight modifications, our proof also\nshows that the inside-obstacle graph sandwich problem, the single-obstacle\ngraph sandwich problem, and the simple-polygon visibility graph sandwich\nproblem are all NP-hard.\n",

In most of these situations, the quality of localization\ndepends on the relative angle between the target and the pair of sensors\nobserving it. In this paper, we consider placing a small number of sensors\nwhich ensure good angular $\\alpha$-coverage: given $\\alpha$ in $[0,\\pi/2]$, for\neach target location $t$, there must be at least two sensors $s_1$ and $s_2$\nsuch that the $\\angle(s_1 t s_2)$ is in the interval $[\\alpha, \\pi-\\alpha]$.\nOne of the main difficulties encountered in such problems is that since the\nconstraints depend on at least two sensors, building a solution must account\nfor the inherent dependency between selected sensors, a feature that generic\nSet Cover techniques do not account for. We introduce a general framework that\nguarantees an angular coverage that is arbitrarily close to $\\alpha$ for any\n$\\alpha <= \\pi/3$ and apply it to a variety of problems to get bi-criteria\napproximations. When the angular coverage is required to be at least a constant\nfraction of $\\alpha$, we obtain results that are strictly better than what\nstandard geometric Set Cover methods give.

An embedding $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$ of a\ngraph $G$ into a 2-manifold $M$ maps the vertices in $V(G)$ to distinct points\nand the edges in $E(G)$ to interior-disjoint Jordan arcs between the\ncorresponding vertices. In applications in clustering, cartography, and\nvisualization, nearby vertices and edges are often bundled to the same point or\noverlapping arcs, due to data compression or low resolution. This raises the\ncomputational problem of deciding whether a given map $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$\ncomes from an embedding. A map $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$ is a \\textbf{weak\nembedding} if it can be perturbed into an embedding\n$\\psi_\\varepsilon:G\\rightarrow M$ with\n$\\|\\varphi-\\psi_\\varepsilon\\|<\\varepsilon$ for every $\\varepsilon>0$, where\n$\\|.\\|$ is the unform norm. A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing weak\nembeddings has recently been found by Fulek and Kyn\\v{c}l. It reduces the\nproblem to solving a system of linear equations over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. It runs in\n$O(n^{2\\omega})\\leq O(n^{4.75})$ time, where $\\omega\\in [2,2.373)$ is the\nmatrix multiplication exponent and $n$ is the number of vertices and edges of\n$G$.

It combines local constraints\non the orientation of subgraphs directly, thereby eliminating the need for\nsolving large systems of linear equations.\n",

However, the current challenge lies in the lack of a general\nmathematical formulation that applies to objects of arbitrary shape. We propose\nthat a measure of shape complementarity can be obtained from the extent of\napproximate overlap between shape skeletons. A space-continuous implicit\ngeneralization of the skeleton, called the skeletal density function (SDF) is\ndefined over the Euclidean space that contains the individual assembly\npartners. The SDF shape descriptors capture the essential features that are\nrelevant to proper contact alignment, and are considerably more robust than the\nconventional explicit skeletal representations. We express the shape\ncomplementarity score as a convolution of the individual SDFs. The problem then\nbreaks down to a global optimization of the score over the configuration space\nof spatial relations, which can be efficiently implemented using fast Fourier\ntransforms (FFTs) on nonequispaced samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe scoring approach for several examples from 2D peg-in-hole alignment to more\ncomplex 3D examples in mechanical assembly and protein docking. We show that\nthe proposed method is reliable, inherently robust against small perturbations,\nand effective in steering gradient-based optimization.\n",

We study the problem of quantifying the interestingness of\nsubpopulations in a Mapper, which appear as long paths, flares, or loops.\nFirst, we create a weighted directed graph G using the 1-skeleton of the\nMapper. We use the average values at the vertices of a target function to\ndirect edges (from low to high). The difference between the average values at\nvertices (high-low) is set as the edge's weight. Covariation of the remaining h\nfunctions (independent variables) is captured by a h-bit binary signature\nassigned to the edge. An interesting path in G is a directed path whose edges\nall have the same signature. We define the interestingness score of such a path\nas a sum of its edge weights multiplied by a nonlinear function of their ranks\nin the path.\n  Second, we study three optimization problems on this graph G. In the problem\nMax-IP, we seek an interesting path in G with the maximum interestingness\nscore. We show that Max-IP is NP-complete. For the special case when G is a\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG), we show that Max-IP can be solved in polynomial\ntime - in O(mnd_i) where d_i is the maximum indegree of a vertex in G.\n  In the more general problem IP, the goal is to find a collection of\nedge-disjoint interesting paths such that the overall sum of their\ninterestingness scores is maximized. We also study a variant of IP termed k-IP,\nwhere the goal is to identify a collection of edge-disjoint interesting paths\neach with k edges, and their total interestingness score is maximized. While\nk-IP can be solved in polynomial time for k <= 2, we show k-IP is NP-complete\nfor k >= 3 even when G is a DAG. We develop polynomial time heuristics for IP\nand k-IP on DAGs.\n",

Problems of this type can be traced back to the classic\nwork of Schwartz and Sharir (1983), who gave a method for deciding the\nexistence of a coordinated motion for a set of disks between obstacles; their\napproach is polynomial in the complexity of the obstacles, but exponential in\nthe number of disks. Other previous work has largely focused on {\\em\nsequential} schedules, in which one robot moves at a time.\n  We provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for minimizing the\nexecution time of a coordinated, {\\em parallel} motion plan for a swarm of\nrobots in the absence of obstacles, provided some amount of separability.\n  Our algorithm achieves {\\em constant stretch factor}: If all robots are at\nmost $d$ units from their respective starting positions, the total duration of\nthe overall schedule is $O(d)$. Extensions include unlabeled robots and\ndifferent classes of robots. We also prove that finding a plan with minimal\nexecution time is NP-hard, even for a grid arrangement without any stationary\nobstacles. On the other hand, we show that for densely packed disks that cannot\nbe well separated, a stretch factor $\\Omega(N^{1/4})$ may be required.

By translating this sequence to a set of points in the plane, a\nrollercoaster can be defined as a polygonal path for which every maximal\nsub-path, with positive- or negative-slope edges, has at least three points.\nGiven a sequence of distinct real numbers, the rollercoaster problem asks for a\nmaximum-length subsequence that is a rollercoaster. It was conjectured that\nevery sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers contains a rollercoaster of length\nat least $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$ for $n>7$, while the best known lower bound is\n$\\Omega(n/\\log n)$. In this paper we prove this conjecture. Our proof is\nconstructive and implies a linear-time algorithm for computing a rollercoaster\nof this length. Extending the $O(n\\log n)$-time algorithm for computing a\nlongest increasing subsequence, we show how to compute a maximum-length\nrollercoaster within the same time bound. A maximum-length rollercoaster in a\npermutation of $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ can be computed in $O(n \\log \\log n)$ time.\n  The search for rollercoasters was motivated by orthogeodesic point-set\nembedding of caterpillars. A caterpillar is a tree such that deleting the\nleaves gives a path, called the spine. A top-view caterpillar is one of degree\n4 such that the two leaves adjacent to each vertex lie on opposite sides of the\nspine.

        "summary": "  This study starts from the counter-intuitive question of how we can render a\nconventional stiff, non-stretchable and even brittle material conformable so\nthat it can fully wrap around a curved surface, such as a sphere, without\nfailure. Here, we answer this conundrum by extending geometrical design in\ncomputational kirigami (paper cutting and folding) to paper wrapping. Our\ncomputational paper wrapping-based approach provides the more robust and\nreliable fabrication of conformal devices than paper folding approaches. This\nin turn leads to a significant increase in the applicability of computational\nkirigami to real-world fabrication. This new computer-aided design transforms\n2D-based conventional materials, such as Si and copper, into a variety of\ntargeted conformal structures that can fully wrap the desired 3D structure\nwithout plastic deformation or fracture. We further demonstrated that our novel\napproach enables a pluripotent design platform to transform conventional\nnon-stretchable 2D-based devices, such as electroluminescent lighting and a\npaper battery, into wearable and conformable 3D curved devices.\n",

IGA is performed directly by integrating over the spline spaces of\nthe volumetric spline representation of the object. Typically, tensor-product\nB-spline trivariates are used to parameterize the volumetric domain. A general\n3D object, that can be modeled in contemporary B-rep CAD tools, is typically\nrepresented using trimmed B-spline surfaces. In order to capture the generality\nof the contemporary B-rep modeling space, while supporting IGA needs, Massarwi\nand Elber (2016) proposed the use of trimmed trivariates volumetric elements.\nHowever, the use of trimmed geometry makes the integration process more\ndifficult since integration over trimmed B-spline basis functions is a highly\nchallenging task. In this work, we propose an algorithm that precisely\ndecomposes a trimmed B-spline trivariate into a set of (singular only on the\nboundary) tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that can be utilized to simplify\nthe integration process in IGA. The trimmed B-spline trivariate is first\nsubdivided into a set of trimmed B\\'ezier trivariates, at all its internal\nknots. Then, each trimmed B\\'ezier trivariate, is decomposed into a set of\nmutually exclusive tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that precisely cover\nthe entire trimmed domain. This process, denoted untrimming, can be performed\nin either the Euclidean space or the parametric space of the trivariate. We\npresent examples on complex trimmed trivariates' based geometry, and we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying IGA over the\n(untrimmed) results.\n",

Nearest-neighbor\ncondensation deals with finding a subset $R \\subseteq P$ such that for every\npoint $p \\in P$, $p$'s nearest-neighbor in $R$ has the same label as $p$.

Under this distance measure, the Reeb graph is stable\nagainst small changes of input functions. At the same time, it remains\ndiscriminative at differentiating input functions. In particular, the main\nresult is that the functional distortion distance between two Reeb graphs is\nbounded from below by (and thus more discriminative than) the bottleneck\ndistance between both the ordinary and extended persistence diagrams for\nappropriate dimensions.\n  As an application of our results, we analyze a natural simplification scheme\nfor Reeb graphs, and show that persistent features in Reeb graph remains\npersistent under simplification.

Functional shapes can be described as signal functions\nsupported on varying geometrical supports. Analysing variability of fshapes'\nensembles require the modelling and quantification of joint variations in\ngeometry and signal, which have been treated separately in previous approaches.\nInstead, building on the ideas of shape spaces for purely geometrical objects,\nwe propose the extended concept of fshape bundles and define Riemannian metrics\nfor fshape metamorphoses to model geometrico-functional transformations within\nthese bundles. We also generalize previous works on data attachment terms based\non the notion of varifolds and demonstrate the utility of these distances.\nBased on these, we propose variational formulations of the atlas estimation\nproblem on populations of fshapes and prove existence of solutions for the\ndifferent models. The second part of the article examines the numerical\nimplementation of the models by detailing discrete expressions for the metrics\nand gradients and proposing an optimization scheme for the atlas estimation\nproblem. We present a few results of the methodology on a synthetic dataset as\nwell as on a population of retinal membranes with thickness maps.\n",

We\ngive a characterisation of how these embedded surfaces intersect with the\ntetrahedra of T. This is done by characterising isotopy classes of simple\nclosed loops in the 3-punctured disk. As a direct result we obtain a new system\nof coordinates for edge colourings which allows for simpler definitions of the\ntetrahedron weights incorporated in the Turaev-Viro invariants.\n  Moreover, building on a detailed analysis of the colourings, as well as\nclassical work due to Kirby and Melvin, Matveev, and others, we show that\nconsidering a much smaller set of colourings suffices to compute Turaev-Viro\ninvariants in certain significant cases. This results in a substantial\nimprovement of running times to compute the invariants, reducing the number of\ncolourings to consider by a factor of $2^n$. In addition, we present an\nalgorithm to compute Turaev-Viro invariants of degree four -- a problem known\nto be #P-hard -- which capitalises on the combinatorial structure of the input.\n  The improved algorithms are shown to be optimal in the following sense: There\nexist triangulations admitting all colourings the algorithms consider.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our new algorithms to compute Turaev-Viro\ninvariants are able to distinguish the majority of $\\mathbb{Z}$-homology\nspheres with complexity up to $11$ in $O(2^n)$ operations in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n",

Many algorithms, for example grid-based numerical PDE\nsolvers, have to access all neighbor cells of each grid cell during a grid\ntraversal. While the array indices of neighbors can be stored in a cell, they\nstill have to be computed for initialization or when the grid is adaptively\nrefined. A fast neighbor-finding algorithm can thus significantly improve the\nruntime of computations on multidimensional grids.\n  In this thesis, we show how neighbors on many regular grids ordered by\nspace-filling curves can be found in an average-case time complexity of $O(1)$.\nIn general, this assumes that the local orientation (i.e. a variable of a\ndescribing grammar) of the SFC inside the grid cell is known in advance, which\ncan be efficiently realized during traversals. Supported SFCs include Hilbert,\nPeano and Sierpinski curves in arbitrary dimensions. We assume that integer\narithmetic operations can be performed in $O(1)$, i.e. independent of the size\nof the integer. We do not deal with the case of adaptively refined grids here.\nHowever, it appears that a generalization of the algorithm to suitable adaptive\ngrids is possible. To formulate the neighbor-finding algorithm and prove its\ncorrectness and runtime properties, a modeling framework is introduced. This\nframework extends the idea of vertex-labeling to a description using grammars\nand matrices. With the sfcpp library, we provide a C++ implementation to render\nSFCs generated by such models and automatically compute all lookup tables\nneeded for the neighbor-finding algorithm. Furthermore, optimized\nneighbor-finding implementations for various SFCs are included for which we\nprovide runtime measurements.\n",

Surface registration between simple surfaces,\nsuch as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very\nfew works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces.\nThe high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface\nregistration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into\nsimply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent\ncuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In\nthis work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between\nhigh-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to\nconformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which\nis either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space\nby minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity\nbetween the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth\nregistration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as\nmuch as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and\nbijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical\nexperiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is\neffective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching. We also\napplied the method to register anatomical structures for medical imaging, which\ndemonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.\n",

The\n\\emph{average stretch factor} of $G$ is the average stretch factor taken over\nall pairs of vertices in $G$.

We complement this upper-bound with a lower\nbound: There exist $n$-point sets in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ for which any graph with\n$O(n)$ edges has average stretch factor $1+\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

The folding is efficient: for\ntarget surfaces topologically equivalent to a sphere, the strip needs to have\nonly twice the target surface area, and the folding stacks at most two layers\nof material anywhere. These geometric results offer a new way to build\nprogrammable matter that is substantially more efficient than what is possible\nwith a square $N \\times N$ sheet of material, which can fold into all polycubes\nonly of surface area $O(N)$ and may stack $\\Theta(N^2)$ layers at one point. We\nalso show how our strip foldings can be executed by a rigid motion without\ncollisions (albeit assuming zero thickness), which is not possible in general\nwith 2D sheet folding.\n  To achieve these results, we develop new approximation algorithms for milling\nthe surface of a grid polyhedron, which simultaneously give a 2-approximation\nin tour length and an 8/3-approximation in the number of turns. Both length and\nturns consume area when folding a strip, so we build on past approximation\nalgorithms for these two objectives from 2D milling.\n",

We also derive upper\nbounds for numbers of several other types of plane graphs (such as connected\nand bi-connected plane graphs), and obtain various bounds on expected\nvertex-degrees in graphs that are uniformly chosen from the set of all\ncrossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be embedded over a specific point\nset.\n  We then show how to apply the cross-graph charging-scheme method for graphs\nthat allow certain types of crossings.

For $k=3$ and $k=4$, we prove that, for any set $S$ of $N$ points in\nthe plane, the number of graphs that have a straight-edge $k$-quasi-planar\nembedding over $S$ is only exponential in $N$.\n",

We design and implement\npractical algorithms in the exact and approximate setting, we experimentally\njuxtapose them and study the tradeoff of exactness and accuracy for speed. We\nanalyze the following methods in order of increasing generality: rejection\nsampling relying on uniformly sampling the simplex, which is the fastest\napproach, but inaccurate for small volumes; exact formulae based on the\ncomputation of integrals of probability distribution functions; an optimized\nLawrence sign decomposition method, since the polytopes at hand are shown to be\nsimple; Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms using random walks based on the\nhit-and-run paradigm generalized to nonlinear convex bodies and relying on new\nmethods for computing a ball enclosed; the latter is experimentally extended to\nnon-convex bodies with very encouraging results.

Goodey proved the\nconjecture for the intersection of the two classes. We examine these classes\nfrom the point of view of distance-two colorings. A distance-two $r$-coloring\nof a graph $G$ is an assignment of $r$ colors to the vertices of $G$ so that\nany two vertices at distance at most two have different colors. Note that a\ncubic graph needs at least four colors. The distance-two four-coloring problem\nfor cubic planar graphs is known to be NP-complete. We claim the problem\nremains NP-complete for tri-connected bipartite cubic planar graphs, which we\ncall type-one Barnette graphs, since they are the first class identified by\nBarnette. By contrast, we claim the problem is polynomial for cubic plane\ngraphs with face sizes $3, 4, 5,$ or $6$, which we call type-two Barnette\ngraphs, because of their relation to Barnette's second conjecture. We call\nGoodey graphs those type-two Barnette graphs all of whose faces have size $4$\nor $6$. We fully describe all Goodey graphs that admit a distance-two\nfour-coloring, and characterize the remaining type-two Barnette graphs that\nadmit a distance-two four-coloring according to their face size.\n  For quartic plane graphs, the analogue of type-two Barnette graphs are graphs\nwith face sizes $3$ or $4$. For this class, the distance-two four-coloring\nproblem is also polynomial; in fact, we can again fully describe all colorable\ninstances -- there are exactly two such graphs.\n",

It sometimes\ncontains additional support structure (also called scaffolding), which has to\nbe removed in post-processing. We describe an approach to automatically\ngenerate process plans for support removal using a multi-axis machining\ninstrument. The goal is to fracture the contact regions between each support\ncomponent and the part, and to do it in the most cost-effective order while\navoiding collisions with evolving near-net shape, including the remaining\nsupport components. A recursive algorithm identifies a maximal collection of\nsupport components whose connection regions to the part are accessible as well\nas the orientations at which they can be removed at a given round. For every\nsuch region, the accessible orientations appear as a 'fiber' in the\ncollision-free space of the evolving near-net shape and the tool assembly. To\norder the removal of accessible supports, the algorithm constructs a search\ngraph whose edges are weighted by the Riemannian distance between the fibers.\nThe least expensive process plan is obtained by solving a traveling salesman\nproblem (TSP) over the search graph. The sequence of configurations obtained by\nsolving TSP is used as the input to a motion planner that finds collision free\npaths to visit all accessible features. The resulting part without the support\nstructure can then be finished using traditional machining to produce the\nintended design. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through\nbenchmark examples in 3D.\n",

In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors\nsuch as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to\ncharacterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One\nof the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based\nvisualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such\ntopological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In\nthis paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and\nuse it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree\nthat minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a\nwell-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic\nstrategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not\nfully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that\nresembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and\noutputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural\nsimilarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty\ninformation for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty,\nreferred to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees.\nFinally, we demonstrate an application of our framework through merge trees\nthat arise from ensembles of scalar fields.

The key construction at the heart\nof our framework is an Euler transformation which converts a 2-dimensional cell\ncomplex K into a new 2-complex K^ such that every vertex in the 1-skeleton G^\nof K^ has even degree. Hence G^ is Eulerian, and a Eulerian tour can be\nfollowed to print all edges in a continuous fashion. We start with a mesh K of\nthe union of polygons obtained by projecting all layers to the plane. We\ncompute its Euler transformation K^. In the slicing step, we clip K^ at each\nlayer using its polygon to obtain a complex that may not necessarily be Euler.\nWe then patch this complex by adding edges such that any odd-degree nodes\ncreated by slicing are transformed to have even degrees again. We print extra\nsupport edges in place of any segments left out to ensure there are no edges\nwithout support in the next layer. These support edges maintain the Euler\nnature of the complex. Finally we describe a tree-based search algorithm that\nbuilds the continuous tool path by traversing \"concentric\" cycles in the Euler\ncomplex.
