The\nexperimental results for the - continuous domain establish that a region which\ndoes not contain any heat sources may become hotter than the regions containing\nthe thermal sources. Thus a hotspot may appear away from the active sources,\nand placing heat sinks on the active thermal sources alone may not suffice to\ntackle thermal imbalance. Power management techniques aid in obtaining a\nuniform power profile throughout the chip, but we propose an algorithm using\nminimum bipartite matching where we try to move the sources minimally (with\nminimum perturbation in the chip floor plan) near cooler points (blocks) to\nobtain a uniform power profile due to diffusion of heat from hotter point to\ncooler ones.\n",

Optical effects can cause unwanted\nillumination at masked sites that are adjacent to the sites intentionally\nexposed to light. This results in synthesis of unforeseen sequences in masked\nsites and compromises interpretation of experimental data. To reduce such\nuncertainty, one can exploit freedom in how probes are assigned to array sites.\nThe border length minimization problem (BLMP) seeks a placement of probes that\nminimizes the sum of border lengths in all masks. In this paper, we propose two\nparallel algorithms for the BLMP. The proposed parallel algorithms have the\nlocal-search paradigm at their core, and are especially developed for the BLMP.\nThe results reported show that, for small microarrays with at most 1156 probes,\nthe proposed parallel algorithms perform better than the best previous\nalgorithms.\n",

Our first result\nutilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly\nof linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in\nstandard tile assembly models. Our second system of signal-passing tiles\nsimulates any Turing machine with high fuel efficiency by using only a constant\nnumber of tiles per computation step. Our third system assembles the discrete\nSierpinski triangle, demonstrating that this pattern can be strictly\nself-assembled within the STAM. This result is of particular interest in that\nit is known that this pattern cannot self-assemble within a number of well\nstudied tile self-assembly models.

In particular, memristors are regarded as a promising solution\nfor modeling key features of biological synapses due to their nanoscale\ndimensions, their capacity to store multiple bits of information per element\nand the low energy required to write distinct states. In this paper, we first\nreview the neuro- and neuromorphic-computing approaches that can best exploit\nthe properties of memristor and-scale devices, and then propose a novel hybrid\nmemristor-CMOS neuromorphic circuit which represents a radical departure from\nconventional neuro-computing approaches, as it uses memristors to directly\nemulate the biophysics and temporal dynamics of real synapses. We point out the\ndifferences between the use of memristors in conventional neuro-computing\narchitectures and the hybrid memristor-CMOS circuit proposed, and argue how\nthis circuit represents an ideal building block for implementing brain-inspired\nprobabilistic computing paradigms that are robust to variability and\nfault-tolerant by design.\n",

This paper demonstrates that\nnetworks of optical energy transfers between quantum nanostructures mediated by\noptical near-field interactions occurring at scales far below the wavelength of\nlight could be utilized for solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP),\nthe satisfiability problem (SAT), and a decision making problem. The optical\nenergy transfer from smaller quantum dots to larger ones, which is a quantum\nstochastic process, depends on the existence of resonant energy levels between\nthe quantum dots or a state-filling effect occurring at the larger quantum\ndots. Such a spatiotemporal mechanism yields different evolutions of energy\ntransfer patterns in multi-quantum-dot systems. We numerically demonstrate that\nnetworks of optical energy transfers can be used for solution searching and\ndecision making. We consider that such an approach paves the way to a novel\nphysical informatics in which both coherent and dissipative processes are\nexploited, with low energy consumption.\n",

The Signal-passing Tile\nAssembly Model (STAM) is an extension of the 2HAM in which the tiles are\ndynamically changing components which are able to alter their binding domains\nas they bind together. For our first result, we demonstrate useful techniques\nand transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ tile set\ninto an STAM$^+$ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of\ncomplexity, in terms of the number and types of ``signals'' they can send, with\na trade off in scale factor.\n  Using these simplifications, we prove that for each temperature $\\tau>1$\nthere exists a 3D tile set in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the\nclass of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\\tau$ (where the STAM$^+$ does\nnot make use of the STAM's power of glue deactivation and assembly breaking, as\nthe tile components of the 2HAM are static and unable to change or break\nbonds). This means that there is a single tile set $U$ in the 3D 2HAM which\ncan, for an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ system $S$, be configured with a\nsingle input configuration which causes $U$ to exactly simulate $S$ at a scale\nfactor dependent upon $S$. Furthermore, this simulation uses only two planes of\nthe third dimension. This implies that there exists a 3D tile set at\ntemperature $2$ in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of\nall 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $1$.

We utilise the knowledge gained from these chemotactic assays to\nroute Physarum polycephalum at a series of junctions. By applying chemical\ninputs at a simple T-junction we were able to reproducibly control the path\ntaken by the plasmodium of P. Polycephalum. Where the chemoattractant farnesene\nwas used at one input a routed signal could be reproducibly generated i.e. P.\nPolycephalum moves towards the source of chemoattractant. Where the\nchemoattractant was applied at both inputs the signal was reproducibly split.\nIf a chemorepellent was used then the signal was reproducibly suppressed. If no\nchemical input was used in the simple circuit then a random signal was\ngenerated, whereby P. Polycephalum would move towards one output at the\njunction, but the direction was randomly selected. We extended this study to a\nmore complex series of T-junctions to explore further the potential of routing\nP. Polycephalum. Although many of the circuits were completed effectively, any\nerrors from the implementation of the simple T-junction were magnified. There\nwere also issues with cascading effects through multiple junctions. For example\nsignal splitting could be reproducibly initiated at the first junction but not\nat subsequent junctions. This work highlights the potential for exploiting\nchemotaxis to achieve complex and reliable routing of P. Polycephalum signals.\nThis may be useful in implementing computing algorithms, design of autonomous\nrobots and directed material synthesis. In additional experiments we showed\nthat the application of chemoattractant compounds at specific locations on a\nhomogeneous substrate could be used to reliably control the spatial\nconfiguration of P.

        "summary": "  Highly accurate and predictive models of resistive switching devices are\nneeded to enable future memory and logic design. Widely used is the memristive\nmodeling approach considering resistive switches as dynamical systems. Here we\nintroduce three evaluation criteria for memristor models, checking for\nplausibility of the I-V characteristics, the presence of a sufficiently\nnon-linearity of the switching kinetics, and the feasibility of predicting the\nbehavior of two anti-serially connected devices correctly. We analyzed two\nclasses of models: the first class comprises common linear memristor models and\nthe second class widely used non-linear memristive models. The linear memristor\nmodels are based on Strukovs initial memristor model extended by different\nwindow functions, while the non-linear models include Picketts physics-based\nmemristor model and models derived thereof. This study reveals lacking\npredictivity of the first class of models, independent of the applied window\nfunction. Only the physics-based model is able to fulfill most of the basic\nevaluation criteria.\n",

The\norganism forages for food by growing these tubes towards detected food stuffs,\nthis foraging behaviour is governed by simple rules of photoavoidance and\nchemotaxis. The electrical activity of the tubes oscillates, creating a\nperistaltic like action within the tubes, forcing cytoplasm along the lumen;\nthe frequency of this oscillation controls the speed and direction of growth.\nExternal stimuli such as light and food cause changes in the oscillation\nfrequency. We demonstrate that using these stimuli as logical inputs we can\napproximate logic gates using these tubes and derive combinational logic\ncircuits by cascading the gates, with software analysis providing the output of\neach gate and determining the input of the following gate. Basic gates OR, AND\nand NOT were correct 90%, 77.8% and 91.7% of the time respectively. Derived\nlogic circuits XOR, Half Adder and Full Adder were 70.8%, 65% and 58.8%\naccurate respectively. Accuracy of the combinational logic decreases as the\nnumber of gates is increased, however they are at least as accurate as previous\nlogic approximations using spatial growth of Physarum polycephalum and up to 30\ntimes as fast at computing the logical output.

Several\nreservoir computer hardware implementations have been realized recently with\nperformance comparable to digital implementations, which demonstrated the\npotential of reservoir computing for ultrahigh bandwidth signal processing\ntasks. In all these implementations however the signal pre-processing necessary\nto efficiently address the reservoir was performed digitally. Here we show how\nthis digital pre-processing can be replaced by an analog input layer. We study\nboth numerically and experimentally to what extent the pre-processing can be\nreplaced by a modulation of the input signal by either a single sine-wave or by\na sum of two sine functions, since harmonic oscillations are particularly easy\nto generate in hardware. We find that the modulation by a single sine gives\nperformance worse than state of the art. On the other hand, on many -but not\nall- tasks, the modulation by two sines gives performances comparable to the\nstate of the art. The present work thus represents an important step towards\nfully autonomous, ultrahigh bandwidth analog reservoir computers.\n",

The\nnew attack does not challenge the unconditional security of the KLJN scheme,\nbut it puts more stringent demands on the security/privacy enhancing protocol\nthan for any earlier attack. In this paper we present a simple defense protocol\nto fully eliminate this new attack by increasing the noise-temperature at the\nside of the smaller resistance value over the noise-temperature at the at the\nside with the greater resistance. It is shown that this simple protocol totally\nremoves Eve's information not only for the new attack but also for the old\nBergou-Scheuer-Yariv attack.

Systems composed of the\nunit-square tiles of the aTAM at temperature 1 are believed to be incapable of\nTuring universal computation (while cooperative systems, with temperature > 1,\nare able). As our main result, we prove that for any polyomino $P$ of size 3 or\ngreater, there exists a temperature-1 polyTAM system containing only shape-$P$\ntiles that is computationally universal. Our proof leverages the geometric\nproperties of these larger (relative to the aTAM) tiles and their abilities to\neffectively utilize geometric blocking of particular growth paths of\nassemblies, while allowing others to complete.\n  To round out our main result, we provide strong evidence that size-1 (i.e.\naTAM tiles) and size-2 polyomino systems are unlikely to be computationally\nuniversal by showing that such systems are incapable of geometric bit-reading,\nwhich is a technique common to all currently known temperature-1\ncomputationally universal systems. We further show that larger polyominoes with\na limited number of binding positions are unlikely to be computationally\nuniversal, as they are only as powerful as temperature-1 aTAM systems.

        "summary": "  Despite all the progress of semiconductor integrated circuit technology, the\nextreme complexity of the human cerebral cortex makes the hardware\nimplementation of neuromorphic networks with a comparable number of devices\nexceptionally challenging. One of the most prospective candidates to provide\ncomparable complexity, while operating much faster and with manageable power\ndissipation, are so-called CrossNets based on hybrid CMOS/memristor circuits.\nIn these circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one or several\ncrossbar layers, with adjustable two-terminal memristors at each crosspoint.\nRecently, there was a significant progress in improvement of technology of\nfabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS\ncircuits, including first demonstrations of their vertical integration.\nSeparately, there have been several demonstrations of discrete memristors as\nartificial synapses for neuromorphic networks. Very recently such experiments\nwere extended to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The\nadjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each\ncrosspoint, and hence the prospects of their scaling are less impressive than\nthose of metal-oxide memristors, whose nonlinear I-V curves enable\ntransistor-free operation. Here we report the first experimental implementation\nof a transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbar with device variability\nlowered sufficiently to demonstrate a successful operation of a simple\nintegrated neural network, a single layer-perceptron. The network could be\ntaught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta-rule algorithm to\nperform the perfect classification of 3x3-pixel black/white images into 3\nclasses. We believe that this demonstration is an important step towards the\nimplementation of much larger and more complex memristive neuromorphic\nnetworks.\n",

In order to achieve the mil- lisecond\nto second time constants required for these synaptic dynamics, analog\nsubthreshold circuits are usually employed. However, due to process variation\nand leakage problems, it is almost impossible to port these types of circuits\nto modern sub-100nm technologies.

The neuromorphic system consumes an area of 0.36 mm2 and runs at a\npower consumption of 1.9 mW.

In the first method Voronoi bisectors are rep-\nresented by deformation of a pre-existing plasmodial network by repellent\nsources acting as generating points. In the second method generating points act\nas inoculation sites for grow- ing plasmodia and Voronoi bisectors are\nrepresented by vacant regions before the plasmodia fuse. To explore the\nbehaviour of minimising networks in the presence of repulsion fields we utilise\na computational model of Physarum as a distributed virtual computing material.\nWe characterise the different types of computational behaviours elicited by\nattraction and repulsion stimuli and demonstrate the approximation Voronoi\ndiagrams using growth towards attractants, avoidance of repellents, and\ncombinations of both. Approximation of Voronoi diagrams for point data sources,\ncomplex planar shapes and circle sets is demonstrated. By altering repellent\ncon- centration we found that partition of data sources was maintained but the\ninternal network connectivity was minimised by the contractile force of the\ntransport network. To conclude, we find that the repertoire of unconventional\ncomputation methods is enhanced by the addition of stimuli presented by\nrepellent fields, suggesting novel approaches to plane-division, packing, and\nminimisation problems.\n",

It is pointed out that this type of erasure is a natural\nenergy-dissipation-free way in which information is lost in\ndouble-potential-well memories, and it may be the reason why the brain can\nforget things effortlessly. We also demonstrate a new non-volatile,\ncharge-based memory scheme wherein the erasure can be associated with even\nnegative energy dissipation; this implies that the memory's environment is\ncooled during information erasure and contradicts Landauer's principle of\nerasure dissipation. On the other hand, writing new information into the memory\nalways requires positive energy dissipation in our schemes. Finally, we show a\nsimple system where even a classical erasure process yields negative energy\ndissipation of arbitrarily large energy.\n",

Comparatively little\nattention has been given to the physical design of molecular receiver and\ntransmitter, envisioning biological synthetic cells with intrinsic molecular\nreception and transmission capabilities as the future nanomachines. However,\nthis assumption leads to a discrepancy between the envisaged applications\nrequiring complex communication interfaces and protocols, and the very limited\ncomputational capacities of the envisioned biological nanomachines. In this\npaper, we examine the feasibility of designing a molecular receiver, in a\nphysical domain other than synthetic biology, meeting the basic requirements of\nnanonetwork applications. We first review the state-of-the-art biosensing\napproaches to determine whether they can inspire a receiver design.

Severe\nlithography and material limitations seen below the 20 nm node, however, are\nchallenging the fundamental premise of affordable CMOS scaling. Just continuing\nto co-optimize leaf cell circuit and layout designs with process technology\ndoes not enable us to exploit the challenges of a sub-20 nm CMOS. For\naffordable scaling it is imperative to work past sub-20 nm technology\nimpediments while exploiting its features. To this end, we propose to broaden\nthe scope of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) to be more holistic by\nincluding micro-architecture design and CAD, along with circuits, layout and\nprocess technology. Applying such holistic DTCO to the most significant block\nin a system-on-chip (SoC), embedded memory, we can synthesize smarter and\nefficient embedded memory blocks that are customized to application needs.\n  To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed holistic DTCO process, we designed,\nfabricated and tested several design experiments in a state-of-the-art IBM\n14SOI process. DTCOed leaf cells, standard cells and SRAM bitcells were robust\nduring testing, but failed to meet node to node area scaling requirements.\nHolistic DTCO, when applied to a widely used parallel access SRAM sub-block,\nconsumed 25% less area with a 50% better performance per watt compared to a\ntraditional implementation using compiled SRAM blocks and standard cells. To\nextend the benefits of holistic DTCO to other embedded memory intensive\nsub-blocks in SoCs, we developed a readily customizable smart memory synthesis\nframework (SMSF). We believe that such an approach is important to establish an\naffordable path for sub-20 nm scaling.\n",

Here we demonstrate that single solid-state TiO2\nmemristors can exhibit associative plasticity phenomena observed in biological\ncortical synapses, and are captured by a phenomenological plasticity model\ncalled triplet rule. This rule comprises of a spike-timing dependent plasticity\nregime and a classical hebbian associative regime, and is compatible with a\nlarge amount of electrophysiology data.

The simulation results showcase that the memristor possess higher\nmemory window and lifetime ({\\tau}) in the higher voltage with lower frequency\nregion, which has been attributed to the fewer data losses in the memory\narchitecture.\n",

ALM, which is in essence an adaptive fuzzy learning method, models\na Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system with several Single-Input\nSingle-Output (SISO) subsystems. Ink Drop Spread (IDS) operator, which is the\nmain processing engine of this method, extracts useful features from the data\nwithout complicated computations and provides stability and convergence as\nwell. Despite great performance of ALM in applications such as classification,\nclustering, and modelling, an efficient hardware implementation has remained a\nchallenging problem. Large amount of memory required to store the information\nof IDS planes as well as the high computational cost of the IDS computing\nsystem are two main barriers to ALM becoming more popular. In this paper, a\nnovel learning method is proposed based on the idea of IDS, but with a novel\napproach that eliminates the computational cost of IDS operator. Unlike\ntraditional approaches, our proposed method finds functions to describe the IDS\nplane that eliminates the need for large amount of memory to a great extent.\nNarrow Path and Spread, which are two main features used in the inference\nengine of ALM, are then extracted from IDS planes with minimum amount of memory\nusage and power consumption. Our proposed algorithm is fully compatible with\nmemristor-crossbar implementation that leads to a significant decrease in the\nnumber of required memristors (from O(n^2) to O(3n)).

However, timing jitter can\nalso result in an indefinite increase in the settling time of clock recovery\ncircuits, particularly in low swing mesochronous systems. Mesochronous clock\nretiming circuits are required in repeaterless low swing on-chip interconnects.\nWe first discuss how timing jitter can result in a large increase in the\nsettling time of the clock recovery circuit. Next, the circuit is modelled as a\nMarkov chain with absorbing states. The mean time to absorption of the Markov\nchain, which represents the mean settling time of the circuit, is determined.\nThe model is validated through behavioural simulations of the circuit, the\nresults of which match well with the model predictions. We consider circuits\nwith (i) data dependent jitter, (ii) random jitter, and (iii) combination of\nboth of them. We show that a mismatch between the strengths of up and down\ncorrections of the retiming can reduce the settling time. In particular, a 10%\nmismatch can reduce the mean settling time by up to 40%. We leverage this fact\ntoward improving the settling time performance, and propose useful techniques\nbased on biased training sequences and mismatched charge pumps. We also present\na coarse+fine clock retiming circuit, which can operate in coarse first mode,\nto reduce the settling time substantially.

We showed by statistical simulations that EDFinFET reduces LER\nbased VT variability by 90% and overall variability by 59%.

The ability to engineer multiple\nSTI levels on tall fins enables different transistor widths (i.e. various W/Ls\ne.g. 1-10) in a single fin. This capability ensures that even though individual\nEDFinFET devices have ~2x larger footprints than FinFETs, EDFinFET may produce\nequal or higher circuit density for basic building blocks like inverters or\nNAND gates for W/Ls of 2 and higher.\n",

The main question this paper addresses is how to deploy these enzymes\nin an effective structure so that ISI mitigation is maximized. To find an\neffective MCvD channel environment, this study considers optimization of the\nshape of the transmitter node, the deployment location and structure, the size\nof the enzyme deployed area, and the half-lives of the enzymes.

Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method\ncan improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general\ncalibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation,\nwe propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended\nstatistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES\nmethod not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher\ncalibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES\nbased calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is\ncurrent source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify\nthis proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we\ndesigned, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design.\nThe receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving\nharmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the\nESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection\nratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a\ncurrent-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based\namplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance.\nSimulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude\nlinearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC.\n",

The problem is an exercise in the propagation and\nprocessing of information within a distributed computational medium. We explore\nwhether the Majority Problem can be approximated in a similarly simple\ndistributed computing substrate - a multi-agent model of slime mould. An\ninitial pattern of discrete voting choices is represented by spatial\narrangement of the agent population, temporarily held in-place by an attractant\nstimulus. When this stimulus is removed the model adapts its shape and size,\nmoving to form a minimal distance connecting line. The final position of this\nline is shown, in simple examples, to successfully represent the majority vote\ndecision, and also accurately reflects the size of the majority.

In this work, we link the memristive fuse concept with\nthat of the Complementary Resistive Switch (CRS), exploit that link to\nexperimentally demonstrate a practical memristive fuse using TiOx-based ReRAM\ncells and explain its basic operational principles. The fuse is stimulated by\ntrains of identical pulses where successive pulse trains feature opposite\npolarities. In response, we observe a gradual (analogue) drop in resistive\nstate followed by a gradual recovery phase regardless of input stimulus\npolarity; echoing traditional, binary CRS behaviour. This analogue switching\nproperty opens the possibility of operating the memristive fuse as a\nsingle-component step change detector. Moreover, we discover that the\ncharacteristics of the individual memristors used to demonstrate the memristive\nfuse concept in this work allow our fuse to be operated in a regime where one\nof the two constituent devices can be switched largely independently from the\nother. This property, not present in the traditional CRS, indicates that the\ninherently analogue memristive fuse architecture may support additional\noperational flexibility through e.g. allowing finer control over its resistive\nstate.\n",

In addition to multi-level nonvolatile memory, we\ndemonstrate here that nonvolatile logic gates such as NOR and NAND can be\nimplemented in a single memtranstor made of the Ni/PMN-PT/Ni heterostructure.\nAfter applying two sequent voltage pulses (X1, X2) as the logic inputs on the\nmemtranstor, the output magnetoelectric voltage can be positive high (logic\n\"1\"), positive low (logic \"0\"), or negative (logic \"0\"), depending on the\nlevels of X1 and X2. The underlying physical mechanism is related to the\ncomplete or partial reversal of ferroelectric polarization controlled by\ninputting selective voltage pulses, which determines the magnitude and sign of\nthe magnetoelectric voltage coefficient. The combined functions of both memory\nand logic could enable the memtranstor as a promising candidate for future\ncomputing systems beyond von Neumann architecture.\n",

To address this issue, this work proposes a novel\ntwo-phase scheme to implement majority logic and evaluates it on an all-spin\nlogic (ASL) majority-based logic structures. In Phase 1, the output is\ninitialized to a preset value. Next in Phase 2, the inputs are evaluated to\nswitch the output magnet to its correct value.

Using such a scheme, an n-input AND gate which\nrequires a total of (2n-1) inputs in the conventional implementation can now be\nimplemented with only (n+1) inputs. When applied to standard logic functions,\nit is demonstrated that the proposed method of designing ASL gates are 1.6-3.4X\nfaster and 1.9-6.9X more energy-efficient than the conventional method, and for\na five-magnet full adder, it is shown that the proposed ASL implementation is\n1.5X faster, 2.2X more energy-efficient, and provides a 16% improvement in\narea.\n",

The non-reciprocity of\nboth device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at\nthe input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism.

This device\nconcept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input\nmajority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin\ntransport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel\nand stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires.

We propose\nSpin-Transfer Torque Compute-in-Memory (STT-CiM), a design for in-memory\ncomputing with Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM). The unique\nproperties of spintronic memory allow multiple wordlines within an array to be\nsimultaneously enabled, opening up the possibility of directly sensing\nfunctions of the values stored in multiple rows using a single access. We\npropose modifications to STT-MRAM peripheral circuits that leverage this\nprinciple to perform logic, arithmetic, and complex vector operations. We\naddress the challenge of reliable in-memory computing under process variations\nby extending ECC schemes to detect and correct errors that occur during CiM\noperations. We also address the question of how STT-CiM should be integrated\nwithin a general-purpose computing system. To this end, we propose\narchitectural enhancements to processor instruction sets and on-chip buses that\nenable STT-CiM to be utilized as a scratchpad memory. Finally, we present data\nmapping techniques to increase the effectiveness of STT-CiM. We evaluate\nSTT-CiM using a device-to-architecture modeling framework, and integrate\ncycle-accurate models of STT-CiM with a commercial processor and on-chip bus\n(Nios II and Avalon from Intel). Our system-level evaluation shows that STT-CiM\nprovides system-level performance improvements of 3.93x on average (upto\n10.4x), and concurrently reduces memory system energy by 3.83x on average (upto\n12.4x).\n",

However, traditional nanophotonics options face\nlimitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher\nstatic power due to continuous laser operation, and an upper limit on\nachievable data rates due to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an\nemerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains\non multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter\ninteraction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC\nthat incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical\ninterconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We explore various\nopto-electronic network hybridization options by augmenting a mesh network with\nHyPPI links, and compare them with the equivalent options afforded by\nconventional nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space\nexploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a\nperformance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1.8x. To further validate our\nestimates, we conduct trace based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark\nsuite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64x, with negligible\nenergy increase. We then further carry out performance and cost projections for\nfully optical NoCs, using HyPPI as well as conventional nanophotonics. These\nfuturistic projections indicate that all-HyPPI NoCs would be two orders more\nenergy efficient than electronics, and two orders more area efficient than\nall-photonic NoCs.\n",

This paper uses individual micro\ncontrollers to emulate p-bits, and we present results for a 4-bit ripple carry\nadder with 48 p-bits and a 4-bit multiplier with 46 p-bits working in inverted\nmode as a factorizer. Our results constitute a first step towards implementing\np-bits with nano devices, like stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions.\n",

Gammaitoni (LNG) present a\nconcrete realization of the Boolean OR irreversible gate, but contrary to the\nstandard Landauer principle, with an arbitrary small dissipation of energy. A\nPopperian good falsification! In this paper we discuss a theoretical\ndescription of the LNG device which is indeed a 3in/3out self--reversible\nrealization of the involved OR gate, satisfying in this way the Landauer\nprinciple of no dispersion of energy, contrary to the LNG conclusions. The\ndifferent point of view is due to a different interpretation of the two outputs\ncorresponding to the inputs 10 and 01, which are considered by LNG\nindistinguishable so producing a non reversible realization of the standard\n2in/1out gate. On the contrary, always considering these two outputs\nindistinguishable, by a suitable normalization function of the cantilever\nangles, the experimental results obtained by the LNG device coincide with the\nOR connective obtained from the third output of the self-reversible 3in/3out CL\ngate by the Inputs-Ancilla->Garbage-Output procedure. Thus, by the\nself-reversibility this realization is without dissipation of energy according\nto the Landauer principle. Furthermore, using the self-reversible Toffoli gate\nit is possible to obtain from the LNG device the realization of the connective\nAND adopting another normalization function on the cantilever angles. Finally,\nby other suitable normalization procedures on cantilever angles it is possible\nto obtain also the other logic NOR and NAND connectives, and in a more\nsophisticated way the XOR and NXOR connectives in a self-reversible way. All\nthis leads to introduce a universal logic machine consisting of the LNG device\nplus a memory containing all the necessary angle normalization functions to\nproduce in a self-reversible way, by choosing one of these latter, the logic\nconnectives now listed.\n",

Boolean values of\nthe inputs are given by the absence (FALSE) or presence (TRUE) of a liquid\nmarble. There are three outputs: two outputs are trajectories of undisturbed\nmarbles (they only report TRUE when just one marble is present at one of the\ninputs), one output is represented by trajectories of colliding marbles (when\ntwo marbles collide they lose their horizontal momentum and fall), this output\nreports TRUE only when two marbles are present at inputs.

In this paper, we present a new design of discrete state memory\ncell consisting of subcells constructed from a memristor and its resistive\nnetwork. A memristor in the sub-cells provides the storage element, while its\nresistive network is used for programming its resistance. Several sub-cells are\nthen connected in parallel, resembling potential divider configuration. The\noutput of the memory cell is the voltage resulting from distributing the input\nvoltage among the sub-cells. Here, proposed design was programmed to obtain 10\nand 27 different output levels depending on the configuration of the combined\nresistive networks within the sub-cell. Despite the simplicity of the circuit,\nthis realization of multilevel memory provides increased number of output\nlevels compared to previous designs of memory technologies based on memristors.\nSimulation results of proposed memory are analyzed providing explicit data on\nthe issues of distinguishing discrete analog output levels and sensitivity of\nthe cell to oscillations in write signal patterns.\n",

This imposes severe constraints on the\nlength of the pulses transmitted in the network, and on the network's\nthroughput. Furthermore, most of these circuits do not decouple the currents\nflowing through memristive devices from the one stimulating the target neuron.\nThis can be a problem when using devices with high conductance values, because\nof the resulting large currents.

This phenomenon can be used in neuromorphic systems\nto compensate for slowly changing conditions or chronic shifts in the system\nconfiguration. However, to avoid interference with other adaptation or learning\nprocesses active in the neuromorphic system, it is important that the\nhomeostatic plasticity mechanism operates on time scales that are much longer\nthan conventional synaptic plasticity ones. In this paper we present an\nultra-low leakage circuit, integrated into an automatic gain control scheme,\nthat can implement the synaptic scaling homeostatic process over extremely long\ntime scales. Synaptic scaling consists in globally scaling the synaptic weights\nof all synapses impinging onto a neuron maintaining their relative differences,\nto preserve the effects of learning. The scheme we propose controls the global\ngain of analog log-domain synapse circuits to keep the neuron's average firing\nrate constant around a set operating point, over extremely long time scales. To\nvalidate the proposed scheme, we implemented the ultra-low leakage synaptic\nscaling homeostatic plasticity circuit in a standard 0.18 $\\mu$m Complementary\nMetal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process, and integrated it in an array of\ndynamic synapses connected to an adaptive integrate and fire neuron. The\ncircuit occupies a silicon area of 84 $\\mu$m x 22 $\\mu$m and consumes\napproximately 10.8 nW with a 1.8 V supply voltage. We present experimental\nresults from the homeostatic circuit and demonstrate how it can be configured\nto exhibit time scales of up to 100 kilo-seconds, thanks to a controllable\nleakage current that can be scaled down to 0.45 atto-Amperes (2.8 electrons/s).\n",

These algorithms involve several lookup-table\n(LUT) based function evaluations such as high-order polynomials and\ntranscendental functions for solving complex neuro-synaptic models, that\ntypically require additional storage. To that effect, we propose `SPARE' - an\nin-memory, distributed processing architecture built on ROM-embedded RAM\ntechnology, for accelerating SNNs. ROM-embedded RAMs allow storage of LUTs,\nembedded within a typical memory array, without additional area overhead. Our\nproposed architecture consists of a 2-D array of Processing Elements (PEs).\nSince most of the computations are done locally within each PE, unnecessary\ndata transfers are restricted, thereby alleviating the von-Neumann bottleneck.\nWe evaluate SPARE for two different ROM-Embedded RAM structures - CMOS based\nROM-Embedded SRAMs (R-SRAMs) and STT-MRAM based ROM-Embedded MRAMs (R-MRAMs).\nMoreover, we analyze trade-offs in terms of energy, area and performance, for\nusing the two technologies on a range of image classification benchmarks.\nFurthermore, we leverage the additional storage density to implement complex\nneuro-synaptic functionalities. This enhances the utility of the proposed\narchitecture by provisioning implementation of any neuron/synaptic behavior as\nnecessitated by the application. Our results show up-to 1.75x, 1.95x and 1.95x\nimprovement in energy, iso-storage area, and iso-area performance,\nrespectively, by using neural network accelerators built on ROM-embedded RAM\nprimitives.\n",

Various memristive technologies such as\noxide-based devices, spintronics and phase change materials have been explored\nto implement the core functional units of neuromorphic systems, namely the\nsynaptic network, and the neuronal functionality, in a fast and energy\nefficient manner. However, various non-idealities in the crossbar\nimplementations of the synaptic arrays can significantly degrade performance of\nneural networks and hence, impose restrictions on feasible crossbar sizes. In\nthis work, we build mathematical models of various non-idealities that occur in\ncrossbar implementations such as source resistance, neuron resistance and\nchip-to-chip device variations and analyze their impact on the classification\naccuracy of a fully connected network (FCN) and convolutional neural network\n(CNN) trained with standard training algorithm.

A computational\nmemory unit where resistive memory devices are organized in crossbar arrays can\nbe used to locally store the synaptic weights in their conductance states.

The new architecture delivers\nclassification accuracies comparable to those of floating-point implementations\nwithout being constrained by challenges associated with the non-ideal weight\nupdate characteristics of emerging resistive memories.

Due to this demand, new solutions for\nstoring data are needed, and one promising media is the DNA. This storage\nsolution provides numerous advantages, which includes the ability to store\ndense information while achieving long-term stability. However, the question as\nhow the data can be retrieved from a DNA-based archive, still remains. In this\npaper, we aim to address this question by proposing a new storage solution that\nrelies upon molecular communication, and in particular bacterial nanonetworks.\nOur solution allows digitally encoded information to be stored into non-motile\nbacteria, which compose an archival architecture of clusters, and to be later\nretrieved by engineered motile bacteria, whenever reading operations are\nneeded. We conducted extensive simulations, in order to determine the\nreliability of data retrieval from non-motile storage clusters, placed at\ndifferent locations. Aiming to assess the feasibility of our solution, we have\nalso conducted wet lab experiments that show how bacteria nanonetworks can\neffectively retrieve a simple message, such as \"Hello World\", by conjugation\nwith non-motile bacteria, and finally mobilize towards a final point.\n",

It also has other highly desirable features such as high density, low\npower operation and excellent scalability. Hence the memristor crossbar\ntechnology can potentially be utilized for developing low-complexity and\nhigh-scalability solution frameworks for solving a large class of convex\noptimization problems, which involve extensive matrix operations and have\ncritical applications in multiple disciplines. This paper, as the first attempt\ntowards this direction, proposes a novel memristor crossbar-based framework for\nsolving two important convex optimization problems, i.e., second-order cone\nprogramming (SOCP) and homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic\nprogramming (QCQP) problems. In this paper, the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) is adopted. It splits the SOCP and homogeneous QCQP problems\ninto sub-problems that involve the solution of linear systems, which could be\neffectively solved using the memristor crossbar in O(1) time complexity. The\nproposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that iterates a constant number of\ntimes. Therefore, algorithms to solve SOCP and homogeneous QCQP problems have\npseudo-O(N) complexity, which is a significant reduction compared to the\nstate-of-the-art software solvers (O(N^3.5) - O(N^4)).\n",

The distribution of these MMs for a\nfully covering receiver is analyzed in two parts: angular and radial\ndimensions.

The model was intentionally developed to\nabstract away not only the notion of time, but also the constraints of\ngeometry. Collections of monomers with binding domains which allow them to form\npolymers via complementary bonds are analyzed to determine their final, stable\nconfigurations, which are those which maximize the number of bonds formed (i.e.\nenthalpy) and the number of independent components (i.e. entropy). In this\npaper, we first develop a definition of what it means for a TBN to perform a\ncomputation, and then present a set of constructions which are capable of\nperforming computations by simulating the behaviors of space-bounded Turing\nmachines and boolean circuits. In contrast to previous TBN results, these\nconstructions are robust to great variability in the counts of monomers\nexisting in the systems and the numbers of polymers that form in parallel.\nAlthough the Turing machine simulating TBNs are inefficient in terms of the\nnumbers of unique monomer types required, as compared to algorithmic\nself-assembling systems in the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), we then\nshow that a general strategy of porting those aTAM system designs to TBNs\nproduces TBNs which incorrectly simulate computations. Finally, we present a\nrefinement of the TBN model which we call the Geometric Thermodynamic Binding\nNetworks (GTBN) model in which monomers are defined with rigid geometries and\nform rigid bonds.

Various approaches\naimed towards bypassing the von-Neumann bottleneck are being extensively\nexplored in the literature. Emerging non-volatile memristive technologies have\nbeen shown to be very efficient in computing analog dot products in an in-situ\nfashion. The memristive analog computation of the dot product results in much\nfaster operation as opposed to digital vector in-memory bit-wise Boolean\ncomputations. However, challenges with respect to large scale manufacturing\ncoupled with the limited endurance of memristors have hindered rapid\ncommercialization of memristive based computing solutions.

By applying\nappropriate analog voltages to the read-ports of the 8T SRAM array, and sensing\nthe output current, an approximate analog-digital dot-product engine can be\nimplemented.

Capacitively driven wire has\nrecently been shown to be effective in improving the performance of global\ninterconnects. Such techniques can reduce the signal swing in the interconnect\nby using a capacitive divider network and does not require an additional\nvoltage supply. However, the large reduction in signal swing makes it necessary\nto use differential signaling and amplification for successful regeneration at\nthe receiver, which add area and static power. ME effect induced magnetization\nreversal has recently been proposed which shows the possibility of using a low\nvoltage to switch a nanomagnet adjacent to a multi-ferroic oxide. Here, we\npropose an ME effect based receiver that uses the low voltage at the receiving\nend of the global wire to switch a nanomagnet. The nanomagnet is also used as\nthe free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the resistance of which is\ntuned through the ME effect. This change in MTJ resistance is converted to full\nswing binary signals by using simple digital components. This process allows\ncapacitive low swing interconnection without differential signaling or\namplification, which leads to significant energy efficiency. Our simulation\nresults indicate that for 5-10 mm long global wires in IBM 45 nm technology,\ncapacitive ME design consumes 3x lower energy compared to full-swing CMOS\ndesign and 2x lower energy compared to differential amplifier based low-swing\ncapacitive CMOS design.\n",

        "summary": "  Although many exciting applications of molecular communication (MC) systems\nare envisioned to be at microscale, the available MC testbeds reported in the\nliterature so far are mostly at macroscale. This may partially be due to the\nfact that controlling an MC system at microscale is quite challenging. To link\nthe macroworld to the microworld, we propose a biological signal conversion\ninterface that can also be seen as a microscale modulator. This interface\ntranslates an optical signal, which can be easily controlled using a\nlight-emitting diode (LED), into a chemical signal by changing the pH of the\nenvironment. The modulator is realized using \\textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria\nthat express the light-driven proton pump gloeorhodopsin from\n\\textit{Gloeobacter violaceus}. Upon inducing external light stimuli, these\nbacteria can locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting protons\ninto the environment. Based on measurement data from a testbed, we develop an\nanalytical model for the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied\noptical signal. Finally, using a pH sensor as detector, we show for an example\nscenario that the proposed setup is able to successfully convert an optical\nsignal representing a sequence of binary symbols into a chemical signal with a\nbit rate of $1$~bit/min.\n",

Symbol synchronization among chemical\nsensors and nanomachines is one of the critical challenges to manage complex\ntasks in the nanonetworks with molecular communication (MC). As in\ndiffusion-based MC, most of the molecules arrive at the receptor closer to the\nstart of the symbol duration, the wrong estimation of the start of the symbol\ninterval leads to a high symbol detection error. By utilizing two types of\nmolecules with different diffusion coefficients we propose a synchronization\ntechnique for MCvD.

An overall concept is described in the following.\nCollision-based cytoskeleton computers implement logical gates via interactions\nbetween travelling localisation (voltage solitons on AF/MT chains and AF/MT\npolymerisation wave fronts). Cytoskeleton networks are grown via programmable\npolymerisation. Data are fed into the AF/MT computing networks via electrical\nand optical means. Data signals are travelling localisations (solitons,\nconformational defects) at the network terminals. The computation is\nimplemented via collisions between the localisations at structural gates\n(branching sites) of the AF/MT network. The results of the computation are\nrecorded electrically and/or optically at the output terminals of the protein\nnetworks. As additional options, optical I/O elements are envisaged via direct\nexcitation of the protein network and by coupling to fluorescent molecules.\n",

This broad inclusion of systems has led to many new physical substrates\nfor RC. Properties essential for reservoirs to compute are tuned through\nreconfiguration of the substrate, such as change in virtual topology or\nphysical morphology. As a result, each substrate possesses a unique `quality'\n-- obtained through reconfiguration -- to realise different reservoirs for\ndifferent tasks. Here we describe an experimental framework to characterise the\nquality of potentially any substrate for RC. Our framework reveals that a\ndefinition of quality is not only useful to compare substrates, but can help\nmap the non-trivial relationship between properties and task performance. In\nthe wider context, the framework offers a greater understanding as to what\nmakes a dynamical system compute, helping improve the design of future\nsubstrates for RC.\n",

Several behavioral or physical based models have been developed\nto explain their operation and to optimize their fabrication parameters. All\nexisting memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and\nrealism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely\ncharacterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical\nprocesses are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ\nquantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model\nfor the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More\nspecifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms\nforming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament\nstructure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the\nconductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization\nof the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate\nour computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation\nresults successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of\nmemristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data,\nprove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of\nmulti-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its\noperation.\n",

However, this logic family requires inter-stage inverters to\nensure signal integrity in cascaded logic circuits, and inverters must be used\nto provide each logical input signal in its complementary form. These inverters\nand complementary signals increase the device count and significantly degrade\noverall system efficiency.\n  Dual-gate ambipolar field-effect transistors natively provide a\nsingle-transistor XNOR operation and permit highly-efficient and compact\ncircuits due to their ambipolar capabilities. Similar to PTL, logic circuits\nbased on ambipolar field-effect transistors require complementary signals.\nTherefore, numerous inverters are required, with significant energy and area\ncosts.\n  Ambipolar field-effect transistors are a natural match for PTL, as hybrid\nambipolar-PTL circuits can simultaneously use these inverters to satisfy their\nnecessity in both PTL and ambipolar circuits. We therefore propose a new hybrid\nambipolar-PTL logic family that exploits the compact logic of PTL and the\nambipolar capabilities of ambipolar field-effect transistors. Novel hybrid\nambipolar-PTL circuits were designed and simulated in SPICE, demonstrating\nstrong signal integrity along with the efficiency advantages of using the\nrequired inverters to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of PTL and\nambipolar circuits. In comparison to the ambipolar field-effect transistors in\nthe conventional CMOS logic structure, our hybrid full adder circuit can reduce\npropagation delay by 47%, energy consumption by 88%, energy-delay product by a\nfactor of 9, and area-energy-delay product by a factor of 20.\n",

In many\nbiological assays, e.g., in bacterial susceptibility tests, samples and\nreagents are required in multiple concentration (or dilution) factors,\nsatisfying certain \"gradient\" patterns such as linear, exponential, or\nparabolic. Dilution gradients are usually prepared with continuous-flow\nmicrofluidic devices; however, they suffer from inflexibility,\nnon-programmability, and from large requirement of costly stock solutions. DMF\nbiochips, on the other hand, are shown to produce, more efficiently, a set of\nrandom dilution factors. However, all existing algorithms fail to optimize the\ncost or performance when a certain gradient pattern is required. In this work,\nwe present an algorithm to generate any arbitrary linear gradient, on-chip,\nwith minimum wastage, while satisfying a required accuracy in the concentration\nfactor. We present new theoretical results on the number of mix-split\noperations and waste computation, and prove an upper bound on the storage\nrequirement. The corresponding layout design of the biochip is also proposed.\nSimulation results on different linear gradients show a significant improvement\nin sample cost over three earlier algorithms used for the generation of\nmultiple concentrations.\n",

This is particularly challenging in SRAM, where manufacturing\nprecision and leakage power control are critical issues. To alleviate some of\nthese challenges a novel non-volatile memory alternative to SRAM was proposed\ncalled nanowire volatile RAM (NWRAM). Due to NWRAMs regular grid based layout\nand innovative circuit style, manufacturing complexity is reduced and at the\nsame time considerable benefits are attained in terms of performance and\nleakage power reduction. In this paper, we elaborate more on NWRAM circuit\naspects and manufacturability, and quantify benefits at 16nm technology node\nthrough simulation against state-of-the-art 6T-SRAM and gridded 8T-SRAM\ndesigns. Our results show the 10T-NWRAM to be 2x faster and 35x better in terms\nof leakage when compared to high performance gridded 8T-SRAM design.\n",

The size and life span of an excitation wave-fragment\ndepend on the illumination level of the medium. Under the right conditions the\nwave-fragments conserve their shape and velocity vectors for extended time\nperiods. We interpret the wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. When\ntwo or more wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new\nwave-fragment. States of the logic variables, represented by the\nwave-fragments, are changed in the result of the collision between the\nwave-fragments. Thus, a logical gate is implemented. Several theoretical\ndesigns and experimental laboratory implementations of Boolean logic gates have\nbeen proposed in the past but little has been done cascading the gates into\nbinary arithmetical circuits. We propose a unique design of a binary one-bit\nfull adder based on a fusion gate. A fusion gate is a two-input three-output\nlogical device which calculates conjunction of the input variables and\nconjunction of one input variable with negation of another input variable. The\ngate is made of three channels: two channels cross each other at an angle,\nthird channel starts at the junction. The channels contain BZ medium. When two\nexcitation wave-fragments, travelling towards each other along input channels,\ncollide at the junction they merge into a single wave-front travelling along\nthe third channel. If there is just one wave-front in the input channel, the\nfront continues its propagation undisturbed. We make a one-bit full adder by\ncascading two fusion gates. We show how to cascade the adder blocks into a\nmany-bit full adder. We evaluate feasibility of our designs by simulating\nevolution of excitation in the gates and adders using numerical integration of\nOregonator equations.\n",

First, when\ndeprived from other stimuli leeches change their behavioural modes in an\nautomated regime in response to mechanical stimulation. Therefore leeches can\ngive us invaluable information on how human beings might behave under stress\nand limited visibility. Second, leeches are ideal blueprints of future\nsoft-bodied rescue robots.

Various optical backplanes using this technology and featuring a\nlarge number of multimode polymer waveguide components have been recently\ndemonstrated. The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex\nwaveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (>=25 Gb/s)\ndue to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch\nconditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the\nhighly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology. In this paper therefore,\nwe present thorough loss and bandwidth studies on siloxane-based multimode\nwaveguides and waveguide components (i.e. bends and crossings) that enable the\nimplementation of passive optical backplanes. The performance of these\ncomponents is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for\ndifferent waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication.\nUseful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for\neach waveguide type. It is shown that the choice of waveguide parameters\ndepends on the particular waveguide layout, assumed launch conditions and\ndesired link bandwidth.

The overall system performance are dominated by interconnect rather\nthan device. As such, it is imperative to accurately measure and model\ninterconnect parasitic in order to predict interconnect performance on silicon.\nDespite many test structures developed in the past to characterize device\nmodels and layout effects, only few of them are available for interconnects.\nNevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too\ncomplicated to be embedded. A compact yet comprehensive test structure to\ncapture all interconnect parasitic in a real chip is needed. To address this\nproblem, this paper describes a set of test structures that can be used to\nstudy the timing performance (i.e. propagation delay and crosstalk) of various\ninterconnect configurations. Moreover, an empirical model is developed to\nestimate the actual RC parasitic. Compared with the state-of-the-art\ninterconnect test structures, the new structure is compact in size and can be\neasily embedded on die as a parasitic variation monitor. We have validated the\nproposed structure on a test chip in TSMC 28nm HPM process.

Previous studies have demonstrated a\nsingle skyrmion-domain wall pair collision in a specially designed magnetic\nracetrack junction. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of multiple\nskyrmions with domain wall pair in a magnetic racetrack. The numerical\nmicromagnetic simulation results indicate that the domain wall pair could be\npinned or depinned by the rectangular notch pinning site depending on both the\nnumber of skyrmions in the racetrack and the magnitude of driving current\ndensity. Such emergent dynamical property could be used to implement a\nthreshold-tunable step function, in which the inputs are skyrmions and\nthreshold could be tuned by the driving current density. The threshold-tunable\nstep function is widely used in logic and neural network applications. We also\npresent a three-input skyrmion-based majority logic gate design to demonstrate\nthe potential application of such dynamic interaction of multiple skyrmions and\ndomain wall pair.\n",

The physical dimensions of CMOS transistors have scaled down\nover the past five decades leading to exponential increases in functional\ndensity and energy consumption. Today, the energy and delay reductions from\nscaling have stagnated, motivating the search for a CMOS replacement. Of these,\nspintronics offers a path for enhancing the functional density and scaling the\nenergy down to fundamental thermodynamic limits of 100kT to 1000kT.

To use memristor as a computational memory element, one\nshould know how the internal state modulates in time when driven by current or\nvoltage. In this paper, we examine three widely used models and make a\ncomparison of how internal state in these models changes with respect to input\ncurrent or voltage. In Strukov model, internal state changes linearly with the\ninput current. However, the linearity of internal state modulation in Yang\nmodel can be controlled. On the other hand, Pickett model shows non linear\nvariation in internal state with the input current.\n",

This article describes a\nuniversal logic gate implemented as a nonlinear mass-spring-damper model,\nfollowed by an automated method to translate computations, expressed as source\ncode of arbitrary complexity, into combinations of this basic building block.\nThe proposed approach is validated numerically in two steps: First, a set of\ndiscrete models are generated from code. The models implement computations with\nincreasing complexity, starting by a simple adder and ending in a 8-bit Turing\ncomplete mechanical processor. Then, the models are forward integrated to\ndemonstrate their computing performance.

Experimentation was performed through\nsandwiching the marbles between two cup-style electrodes and stimulating them\nwith repeated DC pulses at 3.0 V. Our results demonstrate that `entrainment' of\na carbon nanotube filled-copper liquid marble via periodic pulses can cause\ntheir electrical resistance to rapidly switch between high to low resistance\nprofiles, upon inverting the polarity of stimulation: the reduction in\nresistance between high and low profiles was approximately 88\\% after two\nrounds of entrainment. This effect was found to be reversible through reversion\nto the original stimulus polarity and was strengthened by repeated\nexperimentation, as evidenced by a mean reduction in time to switching onset of\n43\\%. These effects were not replicated in nanotube solutions not bound inside\nliquid marbles. Our electrical characterisation also reveals that\nnanotube-filled liquid marbles exhibit pinched loop hysteresis IV profiles\nconsistent with the description of memristors. We conclude by discussing the\napplications of this technology to the development of unconventional computing\ndevices and the study of emergent characteristics in biological neural tissue.\n",

In real biological systems, the\ndegradation of the remaining molecules from a previous transmission is used to\nmitigate ISI. While most prior works have proposed the use of enzymes to\ncatalyze the molecule degradation, enzymes also degrade the molecules carrying\nthe information, which drastically decreases the signal strength. In this\npaper, we propose the use of photolysis reactions, which use the light to\ninstantly transform the emitted molecules so they are no longer recognized\nafter their detection. The light is emitted at an optimal time, allowing the\nreceiver to detect as many molecules as possible, which increases both the\nsignal strength and ISI mitigation. A lower bound expression on the expected\nnumber of the observed molecules at the receiver is derived. The bit error\nprobability expression is also formulated. Both the expected number of observed\nmolecules and the bit error expressions are validated with simulation results,\nwhich show a visible enhancement when using photolysis reactions.

The biological nature of\nchemical signaling makes MC a promising methodology for interdisciplinary\napplications requiring communication between cells and other microscale\ndevices. However, since the life sciences and communications engineering fields\nhave distinct approaches to formulating and solving research problems, the\nmismatch between them can hinder the translation of research results and impede\nthe development and implementation of interdisciplinary solutions. To bridge\nthis gap, this survey proposes a novel communication hierarchy for MC signaling\nin cell biology and maps phenomena, contributions, and problems to the\nhierarchy. The hierarchy includes: 1) the Physical Signal Propagation level; 2)\nthe Physical and Chemical Signal Interaction level; 3) the Signal-Data\nInterface level; 4) the Local Data Abstraction level; and 5) the Application\nlevel. To further demonstrate the proposed hierarchy, it is applied to case\nstudies on quorum sensing, neuronal signaling, and communication via DNA.\nFinally, several open problems are identified for each level and the\nintegration of multiple levels. The proposed hierarchy provides language for\ncommunication engineers to study and interface with biological systems, and\nalso helps biologists to understand how communications engineering concepts can\nbe exploited to interpret, control, and manipulate signaling in cell biology.\n",

        "summary": "  The memristor is promising to be the basic cell of next-generation\ncomputation systems. Compared to the traditional MOSFET device, the memristor\nis efficient over energy and area. But one of the biggest challenges faced with\nresearchers is how to program a memristor's resistance precisely. Recently, an\nalgorithm designed to save 8 valid bits in each memristor is proposed, but this\nis still not sufficient for precise computation. In this paper, we propose a\ncrossbar-based memristor computation scheme supporting precise computations\nwhose operands have 32 valid bits. As a brief introduction, in a multiplication\nwith two operands, one operand is programmed as input signal, and the other\noperand is saved into a so-called crossbar structure, which contains a group of\nmemristors, and each memristor saves several valid bits, usually one or two\nbits only. The computation results,i.e. the multiplication of the two operands,\nare contained in the outputs of the crossbar structure together with noise.\nAnalog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are then used to extract the valid bits,\nwhich are the most significant bits of outputs. These valid bits can be\ncombined together with Digital-to-Analog Converters(DACs) to get the final\nresults. What's more, the precision of this computation scheme can be adjusted\naccording to the definition of the user, 32 valid bits at most, so it is\nqualified for different application contexts.\n",

To overcome blockages, we propose\nto leverage two-hop device-to-device (D2D) relaying. Using stochastic geometry,\nwe derive expressions for the downlink coverage probability of relay-assisted\nmmWave cellular networks when the D2D links are implemented in either uplink\nmmWave or uplink microwave bands. We further investigate the spectral\nefficiency (SE) improvement in the cellular downlink, and the effect of D2D\ntransmissions on the cellular uplink. For mmWave links, we derive the coverage\nprobability using dominant interferer analysis while accounting for both\nblockages and beamforming gains. For microwave D2D links, we derive the\ncoverage probability considering both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight\n(NLOS) propagation. Numerical results show that downlink coverage and SE can be\nimproved using two-hop D2D relaying. Specifically, microwave D2D relays achieve\nbetter coverage because D2D connections can be established under NLOS\nconditions. However, mmWave D2D relays achieve better coverage when the density\nof interferers is large because blockages eliminate interference from NLOS\ninterferers.

Multimode polymer waveguides in particular constitute an attractive\ntechnology for on-board optical interconnects as they provide high bandwidth,\noffer relaxed alignment tolerances, and can be cost-effectively integrated onto\nstandard printed circuit boards (PCBs). However, the continuing improvements in\nbandwidth performance of optical sources make it important to investigate\napproaches to develop high bandwidth polymer waveguides. In this paper, we\npresent dispersion studies on a graded-index (GI) waveguide in siloxane\nmaterials designed to deliver high bandwidth over a range of launch conditions.\nBandwidth-length products of >70 GHzxm and ~65 GHzxm are observed using a\n50/125 um multimode fibre (MMF) launch for input offsets of +/- 10 um without\nand with the use of a mode mixer respectively; and enhanced values of >100\nGHzxm are found under a 10x microscope objective launch for input offsets of\n~18 x 20 um^2. The large range of offsets is within the -1 dB alignment\ntolerances. A theoretical model is developed using the measured refractive\nindex profile of the waveguide, and general agreement is found with\nexperimental bandwidth measurements. The reported results clearly demonstrate\nthe potential of this technology for use in high-speed board-level optical\nlinks, and indicate that data transmission of 100 Gb/s over a multimode polymer\nwaveguide is feasible with appropriate refractive index engineering.\n",

QCA-based Exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are frequently\nused in the construction of several computing subsystems such as adders, linear\nfeedback shift registers, parity generators and checkers.

The BZ LMs have solid--liquid interfaces in\ncontrast to the previously reported BZ encapsulation systems used to study\npattern formations and wave transfers, such as BZ emulsions and BZ vesicles.\nAll these systems are important to study as they can be seen as analogues for\ninformation transfer in excitable systems in nature. Due to the powder coating\nof the LMs, LMs do not wet the underlying substrate, making the LMs mobile,\nenabling them to be easily arranged in arrays. The preparation of complex LMs,\ncontaining an acidic oscillating solution, proves the resilience of LMs and\ntheir application in transporting a wide range of chemical cargoes and in\nplaying a mediating role in chemical reactions. PTFE-coated LMs were harder to\nprepare and not as robust as PE-coated LMs, therefore oscillation studies of BZ\nLMs positioned in arrays only focused on PE-coated LMs. Sporadic transfer of\nexcitation waves was observed between LMs placed in close proximity to each\nother in ordered and disordered arrays, suggesting the transfer of liquid\nspecies possibly arises from contact between imperfectly coated areas at the\nLM--LM interface or capillary action, where solution is actively transported to\nthe marble surface through the coating. Propagation pathways of the excitation\nwaves in both the disordered and ordered arrays of BZ LMs are reported. These\nresults lay the foundations for future studies on information transmission and\nprocessing arrays of BZ LMs, in addition to observing BZ wave propagation in a\nLM and the effect of other physical stimuli such as heat, light and chemical\nenvironments on the dynamics of excitation in arrays of BZ Lms.\n",

Due to the random propagation of carrier\nmolecules, inter-symbol interference (ISI) is a major issue in an MCvD system.\nAlongside ISI, inter-link interference (ILI) is also an issue that increases\nthe total interference for MCvD-based multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)\napproaches. Inspired by the antenna index modulation (IM) concept in\ntraditional communication systems, this paper introduces novel IM-based\ntransmission schemes for MCvD systems. In the paper, molecular space shift\nkeying (MSSK) is proposed as a novel modulation for molecular MIMO systems, and\nit is found that this method combats ISI and ILI considerably better than\nexisting MIMO approaches. For nano-machines that have access to two different\nmolecules, the direct extension of MSSK, quadrature molecular space shift\nkeying (QMSSK) is also proposed. QMSSK is found to combat ISI considerably well\nwhilst not performing well against ILI-caused errors. In order to combat ILI\nmore effectively, another dual-molecule-based novel modulation scheme called\nthe molecular spatial modulation (MSM) is proposed.

However, carefully\nexamining its detailed formulation reveals that the traditional identification\nof logically reversible computational operations with bijective transformations\nof the full digital state space is actually not the correct logical-level\ncharacterization of the full set of classical computational operations that can\nbe carried out physically with asymptotically zero energy dissipation. To find\nthe correct logical conditions for physical reversibility, we must account for\ninitial-state probabilities when applying the Principle. The minimal\nlogical-level requirement for the physical reversibility of deterministic\ncomputational operations is that the subset of initial states that exhibit\nnonzero probability in a given statistical operating context must be\ntransformed one-to-one into final states. Thus, any computational operation is\nconditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive precondition\non its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any\ndeterministic operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0\nwhen the probability of meeting any preselected one of its suitable\npreconditions approaches 1. This realization facilitates simpler designs for\nasymptotically thermodynamically reversible computational hardware, compared to\ndesigns that are restricted to using only fully-bijective operations such as\nToffoli type operations. Thus, this more general framework for reversible\ncomputing provides a more effective theoretical foundation to use for the\ndesign of practical reversible computers than does the more restrictive\ntraditional model of reversible logic. In this paper, we formally develop the\ntheoretical foundations of the generalized model, and briefly survey some of\nits applications.\n",

It has been recognized that hardware BSN's can be\nimplemented using low barrier magnets (LBM's) by minimally modifying\npresent-day magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) devices. A crucial\nparameter that determines the response of these LBM based BSN designs is the\n\\emph{correlation time} of magnetization, $\\tau_c$. In this letter, we show\nthat for magnets with low energy barriers ($\\Delta \\approx k_BT$ and below),\ncircular disk magnets with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) lead to $\\tau_c$\nvalues that are two orders of magnitude smaller compared to $\\tau_c$ for\nmagnets having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and provide analytical\ndescriptions.

We provide a detailed energy-delay\nperformance evaluation of previously proposed BSN designs based on\nSpin-Orbit-Torque (SOT) MRAM and Spin-Transfer-Torque (STT) MRAM employing low\nbarrier circular IMA magnets by SPICE simulations.

        "summary": "  In self-assembly, a $k$-counter is a tile set that grows a horizontal ruler\nfrom left to right, containing $k$ columns each of which encodes a distinct\nbinary string. Counters have been fundamental objects of study in a wide range\nof theoretical models of tile assembly, molecular robotics and\nthermodynamics-based self-assembly due to their construction capabilities using\nfew tile types, time-efficiency of growth and combinatorial structure. Here, we\ndefine a Boolean circuit model, called $n$-wire local railway circuits, where\n$n$ parallel wires are straddled by Boolean gates, each with matching\nfanin/fanout strictly less than $n$, and we show that such a model can not\ncount to $2^n$ nor implement any so-called odd bijective nor quasi-bijective\nfunction. We then define a class of self-assembly systems that includes\ntheoretically interesting and experimentally-implemented systems that compute\n$n$-bit functions and count layer-by-layer. We apply our Boolean circuit result\nto show that those self-assembly systems can not count to $2^n$. This explains\nwhy the experimentally implemented iterated Boolean circuit model of tile\nassembly can not count to $2^n$, yet some previously studied tile system do.\nOur work points the way to understanding the kinds of features required from\nself-assembly and Boolean circuits to implement maximal counters.\n",

In this\npaper, we propose a LEC framework to be employed in the verification process of\nbeyond-CMOS circuits. Our LEC framework is compatible with existing CMOS\ntechnologies, but, also able to check features and capabilities that are unique\nto beyond-CMOS technologies. For instance, the performance of some emerging\ntechnologies benefits from ultra-deep pipelining and verification of such\ncircuits requires new models and algorithms. We, therefore, present the\nMulti-Cycle Input Dependency (MCID) circuit model which is a novel model\nrepresentation of design to explicitly capture the dependency of primary\noutputs of the circuit on sequences of internal signals and inputs. Embedding\nthe proposed circuit model and several structural checking modules, the process\nof verification can be independent of the underlying technology and signaling.\nWe benchmark the proposed framework on post-synthesis rapid single-flux-quantum\n(RSFQ) netlists. Results show a comparative verification time of RSFQ circuit\nbenchmark including 32-bit Kogge-Stone adder, 16-bit integer divider, and\nISCAS'85 circuits with respect to ABC tool for similar CMOS circuits.\n",

Although traditionally non-volatile long-term\nplasticity changes have been implemented in nanoelectronic synapses for\nneuromorphic applications, recent studies in neuroscience have revealed that\nbiological synapses undergo meta-stable volatile strengthening followed by a\nlong-term strengthening provided that the frequency of the input stimulus is\nsufficiently high. Such \"memory strengthening\" and \"memory decay\"\nfunctionalities can potentially lead to adaptive neuromorphic architectures. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate the close resemblance of the magnetization dynamics\nof a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) to short-term plasticity and long-term\npotentiation observed in biological synapses. We illustrate that, in addition\nto the magnitude and duration of the input stimulus, frequency of the stimulus\nplays a critical role in determining long-term potentiation of the MTJ. Such\nMTJ synaptic memory arrays can be utilized to create compact, ultra-fast and\nlow power intelligent neural systems.\n",

This is primarily due to its simple component parts and the\ndistributed nature of the computation which it approximates during its growth,\nforaging and adaptation to a changing environment. Slime mould functions as a\nliving embodied computational material which can be influenced (or pro-\ngrammed) by the placement of external stimuli. The goal of exploiting this\nmaterial behaviour for unconventional computation led to the development of a\nmulti-agent approach to the ap- proximation of slime mould behaviour. The basis\nof the model is a simple dynamical pattern formation mechanism which exhibits\nself-organised formation and subsequent adaptation of collective transport\nnetworks. The system exhibits emergent properties such as relaxation and\nminimisation and it can be considered as a virtual computing material,\ninfluenced by the external application of spatial concentration gradients. In\nthis paper we give an overview of this multi-agent approach to unconventional\ncomputing. We describe its computational mechanisms and different generic\napplication domains, together with concrete example ap- plications of material\ncomputation. We examine the potential exploitation of the approach for\ncomputational geometry, path planning, combinatorial optimisation, data\nsmoothing and statistical applications.\n",

A simple quantitative transformation of the input patterns which\nconsiders the total number of bits in the input string allows us to map the\nrespective input combinations to the correct outputs patterns of the full adder\ncircuit, reducing the circuit combinations from a 2:1 mapping to a 1:1 mapping.\nThe mapping of inputs to outputs also shows an incremental linear progression,\nsuggesting its implementation in a range of physical systems.

However, such 3D architectures within small form\nfactor increase hotspots and demand careful consideration of thermal management\nat all levels of integration [4] as stacked transistors are detached from the\nsubstrate (i.e., heat sink). Traditional system level approaches such as liquid\ncooling [5], heat spreader [6], etc. are inadequate for transistor level 3-D\nintegration and have huge cost overhead [7]. In this paper, we investigate the\nthermal profile for transistor level 3-D integration approaches through finite\nelement based modeling. Additionally, we propose generic physical level heat\nmanagement features for such transistor level 3-D integration and show their\napplication through detailed thermal modeling and simulations. These features\ninclude a thermal junction and heat conducting nano pillar. The heat junction\nis a specialized junction to extract heat from a selected region in 3-D; it\nallows heat conduction without interference with the electrical activities of\nthe circuit. In conjunction with the junction, our proposed thermal pillars\nenable heat dissipation through the substrate; these pillars are analogous to\nTSVs/Vias, but carry only heat. Such structures are generic and is applicable\nto any transistor level 3-D integration approaches. We perform 3-D finite\nelement based analysis to capture both static and transient thermal behaviors\nof 3-D circuits, and show the effectiveness of heat management features. Our\nsimulation results show that without any heat extraction feature, temperature\nfor 3-D integrated circuits increased by almost 100K-200K.

In this paper, we identify three\nmajor decision making factors for the selection of an approximate multipliers\ncircuit: (1) the type of approximate full adder (FA) used to construct the\nmultiplier, (2) the architecture, i.e., array or tree, of the multiplier and\n(3) the placement of sub-modules of approximate and exact multipliers in the\nmain multiplier module. Based on these factors, we explored the design space\nfor circuit level implementations of approximate multipliers. We used circuit\nlevel implementations of some of the most widely used approximate full adders,\ni.e., approximate mirror adders, XOR/XNOR based approximate full adders and\nInexact adder cell. These FA cells are then used to develop circuits for the\napproximate high order compressors as building blocks for 8x8 array and tree\nmultipliers. We then develop various implementations of higher bit multipliers\nby using a combination of exact and inaccurate 8x8 multiplier cells. All these\nimplementations have been done using the Cadence's Spectre tool with the\nTSMC65nm technology. The design space of these multipliers is explored based on\ntheir power, area, delay and error and the best approximate multiplier designs\nare identified. The report also presents the validation of our results using an\nimage blending application. An open source library of implemented cells and\nmultiplier circuits are available online.\n",

Also, power dissipation is the main limitation of all the nano\nelectronics design techniques including the QCA. Researchers have proposed the\nvarious mechanisms to limit this problem. Among them, reversible computing is\nconsidered as the reliable solution to lower the power dissipation. On the\nother hand, adders are fundamental circuits for most digital systems. In this\npaper, Innovation is divided to three sections. In the first section, a method\nfor converting irreversible functions to a reversible one is presented. This\nmethod has advantages such as: converting of irreversible functions to\nreversible one directly and as optimal. So, in this method, sub-optimal methods\nof using of conventional reversible blocks such as Toffoli and Fredkin are not\nused, having of minimum number of garbage outputs and so on. Then, Using the\nmethod, two new symmetric and planar designs of reversible full-adders are\npresented. In the second section, a new symmetric, planar and fault tolerant\nfive-input majority gate is proposed. Based on the designed gate, a reversible\nfull-adder are presented. Also, for this gate, a fault-tolerant analysis is\nproposed. And in the third section, three new 8-bit reversible\nfull-adder/subtractors are designed based on full-adders/subtractors proposed\nin the second section. The results are indicative of the outperformance of the\nproposed designs in comparison to the best available ones in terms of area,\ncomplexity, delay, reversible/irreversible layout, and also in logic level in\nterms of garbage outputs, control inputs, number of majority and NOT gates.\n",

Indeed, a major landmark that enables\nefficient hardware accelerators for deep networks is the recent advances from\nthe machine learning community that have demonstrated aggressively scaled deep\nbinary networks with state-of-the-art accuracies. In this paper, we demonstrate\nhow deep binary networks can be accelerated in modified von-Neumann machines by\nenabling binary convolutions within the SRAM array. In general, binary\nconvolutions consist of bit-wise XNOR followed by a population-count\n(popcount). We present a charge sharing XNOR and popcount operation in 10\ntransistor SRAM cells. We have employed multiple circuit techniques including\ndual-read-worldines (Dual-RWL) along with a dual-stage ADC that overcomes the\ninaccuracies of a low precision ADC, to achieve a fairly accurate popcount. In\naddition, a key highlight of the present work is the fact that we propose\nsectioning of the SRAM array by adding switches onto the read-bitlines, thereby\nachieving improved parallelism. This is beneficial for deep networks, where the\nkernel size grows and requires to be stored in multiple sub-banks. As such, one\nneeds to evaluate the partial popcount from multiple sub-banks and sum them up\nfor achieving the final popcount. For n-sections per sub-array, we can perform\nn convolutions within one particular sub-bank, thereby improving overall system\nthroughput as well as the energy efficiency. Our results at the array level\nshow that the energy consumption and delay per-operation was 1.914pJ and 45ns,\nrespectively. Moreover, an energy improvement of 2.5x, and a performance\nimprovement of 4x was achieved by using the proposed sectioned-SRAM, compared\nto a non-sectioned SRAM design.\n",

The space symbol is transmitted by embedding the information into the\nindex of a single activated transmitter nanomachine. The concentration symbol\nis drawn according to the conventional concentration shift keying (CSK)\nconstellation. Befitting from a single active transmitter during each symbol\ntransmission period, SM-MC can avoid the inter-link interference problem\nexisting in the current multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) MC schemes, which\nhence enables low-complexity symbol detection and performance improvement.\nSpecifically, in our low-complexity scheme, the space symbol is first detected\nby energy comparison, and then the concentration symbol is detected by the\nequal gain combining assisted CSK demodulation. In this paper, we analyze the\nsymbol error rate (SER) of the SM-MC and its special case, namely the space\nshift keying based MC (SSK-MC), where only space symbol is transmitted and no\nCSK modulation is invoked. Finally, the analytical results are validated by\ncomputer simulations, and our studies demonstrate that both the SM-MC and\nSSK-MC are capable of achieving better SER performance than the conventional\nMIMO-MC and single-input single-output MC (SISO-MC) when the same symbol rate\nis assumed.\n",

In addition to their compactness and non-volatility\nfeatures, they are characterized by computationally relevant physical\nproperties, such as state-dependence, non-linear conductance changes, and\nintrinsic variability in both their switching threshold and conductance values,\nthat make them ideal devices for emulating the bio-physics of real synapses. In\nthis paper we present a spiking neural network architecture that supports the\nuse of memristive devices as synaptic elements, and propose mixed-signal\nanalog-digital interfacing circuits which mitigate the effect of variability in\ntheir conductance values and exploit their variability in the switching\nthreshold, for implementing stochastic learning. The effect of device\nvariability is mitigated by using pairs of memristive devices configured in a\ncomplementary push-pull mechanism and interfaced to a current-mode normalizer\ncircuit. The stochastic learning mechanism is obtained by mapping the desired\nchange in synaptic weight into a corresponding switching probability that is\nderived from the intrinsic stochastic behavior of memristive devices. We\ndemonstrate the features of the CMOS circuits and apply the architecture\nproposed to a standard neural network hand-written digit classification\nbenchmark based on the MNIST data-set. We evaluate the performance of the\napproach proposed on this benchmark using behavioral-level spiking neural\nnetwork simulation, showing both the effect of the reduction in conductance\nvariability produced by the current-mode normalizer circuit, and the increase\nin performance as a function of the number of memristive devices used in each\nsynapse.\n",

In addition to being used as a\nstandalone memory, there has been a growing interest in integration of PCM\ndevices on top of the CMOS layer for computation in memory and neuromorphic\ncomputing. The large CMOS overhead for memory controllers is a limiting factor\nfor this purpose. Transferring functionality like routing, multiplexing, and\nlogic to the memory layer can substantially reduce the CMOS overhead, making it\npossible to integrate 100s of GB of PCM storage on top of a conventional CPU.\nIn this work, we present computational analysis of a phase change device\nconcept that can perform toggle operations.

        "summary": "  Crosstalk computing, involving engineered interference between nanoscale\nmetal lines, offers a fresh perspective to scaling through co-existence with\nCMOS. Through capacitive manipulations and innovative circuit style, not only\nprimitive gates can be implemented, but custom logic cells such as an Adder,\nSubtractor can be implemented with huge gains. Our simulations show over 5x\ndensity and 2x power benefits over CMOS custom designs at 16nm [1]. This paper\nintroduces the Crosstalk circuit style and a key method for large-scale circuit\nsynthesis utilizing existing EDA tool flow. We propose to manipulate the CMOS\nsynthesis flow by adding two extra steps: conversion of the gate-level netlist\nto Crosstalk implementation friendly netlist through logic simplification and\nCrosstalk gate mapping, and the inclusion of custom cell libraries for\nautomated placement and layout. Our logic simplification approach first\nconverts Cadence generated structured netlist to Boolean expressions and then\nuses the majority synthesis tool to obtain majority functions, which is further\nused to simplify functions for Crosstalk friendly implementations. We compare\nour approach of logic simplification to that of CMOS and majority logic-based\napproaches. Crosstalk circuits share some similarities to majority synthesis\nthat are typically applied to Quantum Cellular Automata technology. However,\nour investigation shows that by closely following Crosstalk's core circuit\nstyles, most benefits can be achieved. In the best case, our approach shows 36%\ndensity improvements over majority synthesis for MCNC benchmark.\n",

A particularly\nexciting vision is using them for implementing Binarized Neural Networks\n(BNNs), a class of deep neural networks with a highly reduced memory footprint.\nThe challenge of resistive memory, however, is that they are prone to device\nvariation, which can lead to bit errors. In this work we show that BNNs can\ntolerate these bit errors to an outstanding level, through simulations of\nnetworks on the MNIST and CIFAR10 tasks. If a standard BNN is used, up to 10^-4\nbit error rate can be tolerated with little impact on recognition performance\non both MNIST and CIFAR10. We then show that by adapting the training procedure\nto the fact that the BNN will be operated on error-prone hardware, this\ntolerance can be extended to a bit error rate of 4x10^-2. The requirements for\nRRAM are therefore a lot less stringent for BNNs than more traditional\napplications. We show, based on experimental measurements on a RRAM HfO2\ntechnology, that this result can allow reduce RRAM programming energy by a\nfactor 30.\n",

The emergence of\nresistive memory technologies indeed provides an opportunity to co-integrate\ntightly logic and memory in hardware. In parallel, the recently proposed\nconcept of Binarized Neural Network, where multiplications are replaced by\nexclusive NOR (XNOR) logic gates, offers a way to implement artificial\nintelligence using very low precision computation. In this work, we therefore\npropose a strategy to implement low energy Binarized Neural Networks, which\nemploys brain-inspired concepts, while retaining energy benefits from digital\nelectronics. We design, fabricate and test a memory array, including periphery\nand sensing circuits, optimized for this in-memory computing scheme. Our\ncircuit employs hafnium oxide resistive memory integrated in the back end of\nline of a 130 nanometer CMOS process, in a two transistors - two resistors\ncell, which allows performing the exclusive NOR operations of the neural\nnetwork directly within the sense amplifiers. We show, based on extensive\nelectrical measurements, that our design allows reducing the amount of bit\nerrors on the synaptic weights, without the use of formal error correcting\ncodes. We design a whole system using this memory array. We show on standard\nmachine learning tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and an ECG task) that the\nsystem has an inherent resilience to bit errors.

The probabilistic absorber is an\nabsorber which absorbs molecules upon collision with probability q. With random\nwalk analysis, the discrete probability function of particle location in the\npresence of a probabilistic absorber can be found. Then, a continuous\nprobability function is fitted to this Markov-based results with introducing\nseveral fitting parameters to the known probability function of particle\nlocation in an unbounded environment without an absorbing barrier. With this\napproach, a single receptor is modeled as an M/M/1/1 queue in which q\nrepresents the complementary blocking probability and the mean service time is\nthe mean trafficking time. Therefore, we are able to model the stochastic\nnature of ligand-receptor binding, which comes from the incapability of a\nreceptor to receive all molecules in its space; and also known as receptor\noccupancy. The proper consideration of the absorption effect leads to the\naccurate calculation of the concentration at the desired site, which is\ndefinitely less than the concentration obtained when neglecting it. These\nfindings can have a crucial role in designing drug delivery systems in which\ndetermining the optimal rate of the drug transmitting nanomachines is critical\nto avoid toxicity while maintaining effectiveness.\n",

        "summary": "  Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a method of achieving nano-\nand micro-scale connectivity by utilizing the free diffusion mechanism of\ninformation molecules. The randomness in diffusive propagation is the main\ncause of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the limiting factor of high data\nrate MCvD applications. In this paper, an apertured plane is considered between\nthe transmitter and the receiver of an MCvD link. Either after being\nartificially placed or occurring naturally, surfaces or volumes that resemble\nan apertured plane only allow a fraction of the molecules to pass. Contrary to\nintuition, it is observed that such topology may improve communication\nperformance, given the molecules that can pass through the aperture are the\nones that take more directed paths towards the receiver. Furthermore, through\nboth computer simulations and a theoretical signal evaluation metric named\nsignal-to-interference and noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), it is found that the\nsize of the aperture imposes a trade-off between the received signal power and\nthe ISI combating capability of an MCvD system, hinting to an optimal aperture\nsize that minimizes the bit error rate (BER). It is observed that the trend of\nBER is accurately mirrored by SINAR, suggesting the proposed metric's\napplicability to optimization tasks in MCvD systems, including finding the\noptimal aperture size of an apertured plane. In addition, computer simulations\nand SINAR show that said optimal aperture size is affected by the location of\nthe aperture and the bit rate. Lastly, the paper analyzes the effects of radial\nand angular offsets in the placement of the apertured plane, and finds that a\nreduction in BER is still in effect up to certain offset values. Overall, our\nresults imply that apertured plane-like surfaces may actually help\ncommunication efficiency, even though they reduce the received signal power.\n",

A 1T-1R synapse, adding a transistor (1T) in series with the memristive\nsynapse (1R), has been proposed to mitigate such non-idealities. We observe\nthat the non-linear characteristics of the transistor affect the overall\nconductance of the 1T-1R cell which in turn affects the\nMatrix-Vector-Multiplication (MVM) operation in crossbars. This 1T-1R\nnon-ideality arising from the input voltage-dependent non-linearity is not only\ndifficult to model or formulate, but also causes a drastic performance\ndegradation of DNNs when mapped onto crossbars. In this paper, we analyse the\nnon-linearity of the 1T-1R crossbar and propose a novel Non-linearity Aware\nTraining (NEAT) method to address the non-idealities. Specifically, we first\nidentify the range of network weights, which can be mapped into the 1T-1R cell\nwithin the linear operating region of the transistor. Thereafter, we regularize\nthe weights of the DNNs to exist within the linear operating range by using\niterative training algorithm. Our iterative training significantly recovers the\nclassification accuracy drop caused by the non-linearity. Moreover, we find\nthat each layer has a different weight distribution and in turn requires\ndifferent gate voltage of transistor to guarantee linear operation. Based on\nthis observation, we achieve energy efficiency while preserving classification\naccuracy by applying heterogeneous gate voltage control to the 1T-1R cells\nacross different layers. Finally, we conduct various experiments on CIFAR10 and\nCIFAR100 benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nnon-linearity aware training. Overall, NEAT yields ~20% energy gain with less\nthan 1% accuracy loss (with homogeneous gate control) when mapping ResNet18\nnetworks on 1T-1R crossbars.\n",

For instance, the processing must terminate within a\ngiven time limit; or a signal processing computer must integrate input\ninformation across several timescales; or a robot motor controller must react\nto sensor signals with a short latency. For classical digital computing\nmachines such requirements pose no fundamental problems as long as the physical\nclock rate is fast enough for the fastest relevant timescales. However, when\ndigital microchips become scaled down into the few-nanometer range where\nquantum noise and device mismatch become unavoidable, or when the digital\ncomputing paradigm is altogether abandoned in analog neuromorphic systems or\nother unconventional hardware bases, it can become difficult to relate\ntimescale conditions to the physical hardware dynamics. Here we explore the\nrelations between task-defined timescale conditions and physical hardware\ntimescales in some depth. The article has two main parts. In the first part we\ndevelop an abstract model of a generic computational system that admits a\nunified discussion of computational timescales. This model is general enough to\ncover digital computing systems as well as analog neuromorphic or other\nunconventional ones. We identify four major types of timescales which require\nseparate considerations: causal physical timescales; timescales of phenomenal\nchange which characterize the ``speed'' of how something changes in time;\ntimescales of reactivity which describe how fast a computing system can react\nto incoming trigger information; and memory timescales.

Despite the\nimportance of experimental research for the evolution of SMC towards a mature\ncommunication paradigm that will eventually support revolutionary applications\nbeyond the reach of today's prevalent communication paradigms, the existing\nbody of literature is still comparatively sparse. Long-range SMC systems have\nbeen proposed in the literature for information transmission in two types of\nfluid media, liquid and air. While both types of SMC systems, liquid-based and\nair-based systems, rely on encoding and transmitting information using\nmolecules, they differ substantially in terms of the physical system designs\nand in the type of applications they are intended for. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic characterization of experimental works on long-range SMC\nthat reveals the major drivers of these works in terms of the respective target\napplications. Furthermore, the physical designs for long-range SMC proposed in\nthe literature are comprehensively reviewed. In this way, our survey will\ncontribute to making experimental research in this field more accessible and\nidentifying novel directions for future research.\n",

CRS cells offer two high resistive\nstorage states, and thus, parasitic sneak currents are efficiently avoided.\nHowever, until now the CRS-based logic-in-memory approach was only shown to be\nable to perform basic Boolean logic operations using a single CRS cell. In this\npaper, we introduce two multi-bit adder schemes using the CRS-based\nlogic-in-memory approach. We proof the concepts by means of SPICE simulations\nusing a dynamical memristive device model of a ReRAM cell. Finally, we show the\nadvantages of our novel adder concept in terms of step count and number of\ndevices in comparison to a recently published adder approach, which applies the\nconventional ReRAM-based sequential logic concept introduced by Borghetti et\nal.\n",

A number of reversible gates have been proposed by different\nresearchers and various combinational circuits based on reversible gates have\nbeen developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible\nlogic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available\nbecause of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing\nfeedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits\nhave been reported in the literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed\nthe problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate\nsuitable for sequential building block i.e. T flip-flop and hence designing low\ncost synchronous and asynchronous counters. Another side is to generate the\ncircuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose\ndesigns of reversible counters are significantly better in optimization\nparameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available\nin literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible\ncircuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been\nreported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM.Because of\nnon-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our\nresults cannot be compared with any other circuits. We expect that the\nsequential reversible circuits will help in debugging the reversible circuits,\nhandling the ambiguous state of an FSM and generating the original input in\nreverse direction by reversing the original output.\n",

Reversible flip-flops are the basic memory elements\nthat will be the building block of memory for reversible computing and quantum\ncomputing devices.

Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density\ntechnology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform\ncomputation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior\n(storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that\ncan embed computation with storage.\n  This paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances\nof the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of\nmemristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based\ncontent addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over\nlarge datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes\na concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data\nstructures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS\nprocessor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable\nmemristor technologies for lower levels.\n  We use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and\nuse analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data\nstructures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our\nconfigurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive\napplications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries.\nFurthermore, the configurability of memristor arrays and the proposed data\nstructures provide opportunities to tune the trade- off between performance and\nlifetime and the data structures can be easily adapted to future memristors or\nother technologies with improved endurance.\n",

These molecules are received when they chemically react with compliant\nreceptors deployed on the receiver surface. In these conditions, if the release\nrate is relatively high and the drug absorption time is significant, congestion\nmay happen, essentially at the receiver site. This phenomenon limits the drug\nabsorption rate and makes the signal transmission ineffective, with an\nundesired diffusion of drug molecules elsewhere in the body. The original\ncontribution of this paper consists of a theoretical analysis of the causes of\ncongestion in diffusion-based molecular communications. For this purpose, it is\nproposed a reception model consisting of a set of pure loss queuing systems.\nThe proposed model exhibits an excellent agreement with the results of a\nsimulation campaign made by using the Biological and Nano-Scale communication\nsimulator version 2 (BiNS2), a well-known simulator for molecular\ncommunications, whose reliability has been assessed through in-vitro\nexperiments.

The reservoir is fixed and only the\nreadout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and\nclassification.

In fact, such physical reservoir computing has\nattracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of\nthis review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir\ncomputing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir.

To link the macroworld to the microworld, we propose and\ndemonstrate a biological signal conversion interface that can also be seen as a\nmicroscale modulator. In particular, the proposed interface transduces an\noptical signal, which is controlled using an LED, into a chemical signal by\nchanging the pH of the environment. The modulator is realized using E. coli\nbacteria as microscale entity expressing the light-driven proton pump\ngloeorhodopsin from Gloeobacter violaceus. Upon inducing external light\nstimuli, these bacteria locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting\nprotons into the environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed\noptical-to-chemical signal converter, we analyze the pH signal measured by a pH\nsensor, which serves as receiver. We develop an analytical parametric model for\nthe induced chemical signal as a function of the applied optical signal. Using\nthis model, we derive a training-based channel estimator which estimates the\nparameters of the proposed model to fit the measurement data. We further derive\nthe optimal maximum likelihood detector and a suboptimal low-complexity\ndetector to recover the transmitted data from the measured received signal. It\nis shown that the proposed parametric model is in good agreement with the\nmeasurement data. Moreover, for an example scenario, we show that the proposed\nsetup is able to successfully convert an optical signal representing a sequence\nof binary symbols into a chemical signal with a bit rate of 1 bit/minute and\nrecover the transmitted data from the chemical signal using the proposed\nestimation and detection~schemes. The proposed modulator may form the basis for\nfuture MC testbeds and applications at microscale.\n",

The low achievable data\nrate is the main disadvantage of diffusion-based molecular over radio-based\ncommunication. One solution to overcome this disadvantage is molecular MIMO\ncommunication. In this paper, we introduce molecular spatial modulation (MSM)\nin molecular MIMO communication to increase the data rate of the system. Also,\nspecial detection methods are used, all of which are based on the threshold\nlevel detection method. They use diversity techniques in molecular\ncommunication systems if the channel matrix that we introduce is full rank.\nAlso, for a 2$\\times$1 system, we define an optimization problem to obtain the\nsuitable number of molecules for transmitting to reduce BER of this systems.\nThen the proposed modulation is generalized to $2\\times2$ and $4\\times4$\nsystems. In each of these systems, special detection methods based on the\nthreshold level detection are used. Finally, based on BER, systems using MSM\nare fairly compared to the systems that have similar data rates. The simulation\nresults show that the proposed modulation and detection methods reduce BER.\nWhereas the proposed methods are very simple and practical for molecular\nsystems.\n",

A key technical\nchallenge lies in embedding computation in molecular contexts where electronic\nmicro-controllers cannot be inserted. This necessitates effective\nrepresentation of computation using molecular components. While previous work\nestablished the Turing-completeness of chemical reactions, defining\nrepresentations that are faithful, efficient, and practical remains\nchallenging. This paper introduces CRN++, a new language for programming\ndeterministic (mass-action) chemical kinetics to perform computation. We\npresent its syntax and semantics, and build a compiler translating CRN++\nprograms into chemical reactions, thereby laying the foundation of a\ncomprehensive framework for molecular programming. Our language addresses the\nkey challenge of embedding familiar imperative constructs into a set of\nchemical reactions happening simultaneously and manipulating real-valued\nconcentrations. Although some deviation from ideal output value cannot be\navoided, we develop methods to minimize the error, and implement error analysis\ntools. We demonstrate the feasibility of using CRN++ on a suite of well-known\nalgorithms for discrete and real-valued computation. CRN++ can be easily\nextended to support new commands or chemical reaction implementations, and thus\nprovides a foundation for developing more robust and practical molecular\nprograms.\n",

Landauer discussed that it is\nimpossible to break this limit as long as the computations are performed in the\nconventional, non-reversible way. But even if reversible computations were\nperformed, the basic energy needed for operating circuits realized in\nconventional technologies is still far above the (kBT ln 2) energy limit, i.e.\nthe circuits do not operate physically reversible. In contrast, novel\nnanotechnologies like Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) allow for\ncomputations with very low energy dissipation and, hence, are promising\ncandidates for breaking this limit. Accordingly, the design of reversible QCA\ncircuits is an active field of research. But whether QCA in general (and the\nproposed circuits in particular) are indeed able to operate in a logically and\nphysically reversible fashion is unknown thus far, because neither physical\nrealizations nor appropriate simulation approaches were available yet. In this\nwork, we address this gap by utilizing an established theoretical model that\nhas been implemented in a physics simulator enabling a precise consideration of\nhow energy is dissipated in QCA designs. Our results provide strong evidence\nthat QCA is indeed a suitable technology for near zero-energy computing.\nFurther, the first design of a logically and physically reversible adder\ncircuit is presented which serves as proof-of-concept for future circuits with\nthe ability of near zero-energy computing.\n",

Logic in-Memory (LIM) approaches aim to\naddress this bottleneck by computing inside the memory units and thereby\neliminating the energy-intensive and time-consuming data movement. However,\nmost LIM approaches reported in literature are not truly \"simultaneous\" as\nduring LIM operation the bitcell can be used only as a Memory cell or only as a\nLogic cell. The bitcell is not capable of storing both the Memory/Logic outputs\nsimultaneously. Here, we propose a novel 'Simultaneous Logic in-Memory' (SLIM)\nmethodology that allows to implement both Memory and Logic operations\nsimultaneously on the same bitcell in a non-destructive manner without losing\nthe previously stored Memory state. Through extensive experiments we\ndemonstrate the SLIM methodology using non-filamentary bilayer analog OxRAM\ndevices with NMOS transistors (2T-1R bitcell). Detailed programming scheme,\narray level implementation and controller architecture are also proposed.\nFurthermore, to study the impact of introducing SLIM array in the memory\nhierarchy, a simple image processing application (edge detection) is also\ninvestigated.

Recent microfluidic technologies offer suitable\nplatforms for automating dilutions on-chip, and typically on a digital\nmicrofluidic biochip (DMFB), a sequence of (1:1) mix-split operations is\nperformed on fluid droplets to achieve the target concentration factor (CF) of\na sample. An (1:1) mixing model ideally comprises mixing of two unit-volume\ndroplets followed by a (balanced) splitting into two unit-volume\ndaughter-droplets. However, a major source of error in fluidic operations is\ndue to unbalanced splitting, where two unequal-volume droplets are produced\nfollowing a split. Such volumetric split-errors occurring in different\nmix-split steps of the reaction path often cause a significant drift in the\ntarget-CF of the sample, the precision of which cannot be compromised in\nlife-critical assays. In order to circumvent this problem, several\nerror-recovery or error-tolerant techniques have been proposed recently for\nDMFBs. Unfortunately, the impact of such fluidic errors on a target-CF and the\ndynamics of their behavior have not yet been rigorously analyzed. In this work,\nwe investigate the effect of multiple volumetric split-errors on various\ntarget-CFs during sample preparation. We also perform a detailed analysis of\nthe worst-case scenario, i.e., the condition when the error in a target-CF is\nmaximized. This analysis may lead to the development of new techniques for\nerror-tolerant sample preparation with DMFBs without using any sensing\noperation.\n",

        "summary": "  Synthetic molecular communication (MC) is a new communication engineering\nparadigm which is expected to enable revolutionary applications such as smart\ndrug delivery and real-time health monitoring. The design and implementation of\nsynthetic MC systems (MCSs) at nano- and microscale is very challenging. This\nis particularly true for synthetic MCSs employing biological components as\ntransmitters and receivers or as interfaces with natural biological MCSs.\nNevertheless, since such biological components have been optimized by nature\nover billions of years, using them in synthetic MCSs is highly promising. This\npaper provides a survey of biological components that can potentially serve as\nthe main building blocks, i.e., transmitter, receiver, and signaling particles,\nfor the design and implementation of synthetic MCSs. Nature uses a large\nvariety of signaling particles of different sizes and with vastly different\nproperties for communication among biological entities. Here, we focus on three\nimportant classes of signaling particles: cations (specifically protons and\ncalcium ions), neurotransmitters (specifically acetylcholine, dopamine, and\nserotonin), and phosphopeptides. For each of these candidate signaling\nparticles, we present several specific transmitter and receiver structures\nmainly built upon proteins that are capable of performing the distinct\nphysiological functionalities required from the transmitters and receivers of\nMCSs. Moreover, we present options for both microscale implementation of MCSs\nas well as the micro-to-macroscale interfaces needed for experimental\nevaluation of MCSs. Furthermore, we outline new research directions for the\nimplementation and the theoretical design and analysis of the proposed\ntransmitter and receiver architectures.\n",

When\nconsidering the BZ reaction there are limited studies dealing with thermal\ncycling, particularly cooling, for external control. Recently, liquid marbles\n(LMs) have been demonstrated as a means of confining the Belousov-Zhabotinsky\nreaction in a system containing a solid-liquid interface. BZ LMs were prepared\nby rolling 50 {\\mu}l droplets in polyethylene (PE) powder. Oscillations of\nelectrical potential differences within the marble were recorded by inserting a\npair of electrodes through the LM powder coating into the BZ solution core.\nElectrical potential differences of up to 100mV were observed with an average\nperiod of oscillation ca. 44 s. BZ LMs were subsequently frozen to -1oC to\nobserve changes in the frequency of electrical potential oscillations. The\nfrequency of oscillations reduced upon freezing to 11mHz cf. 23mHz at ambient\ntemperature. The oscillation frequency of the frozen BZ LM returned to 23mHz\nupon warming to ambient temperature. Several cycles of frequency fluctuations\nwere able to be achieved.\n",

Normally, some other\ndevices like resistor or capacitor are still necessary on recent works of fully\nmemristive learning framework. However, theoretically, one neuron needs axon\nand dendrite only, which makes technique process simpler and learning framework\nmore similar to biologic brain. In this paper, a fully memristive\nspiking-neuron learning framework is introduced, in which a neuron structure is\njust built of one drift and one diffusion memristive models. To verify it\nmerits, a feedforward neural network for pattern recognition and a cellular\nneural network for edge detection are designed. Experiment results show that\ncompared to other memristive neural networks, our framework's the processing\nspeed is much faster and the hardware resource is saved in pattern recognition\ndue to its simple structure.

MC channel in practice can be crowded with different types of\nmolecules, i.e., ligands, which can have similar binding properties causing\nsevere cross-talk on ligand receptors. Simultaneous sensing of multiple ligand\ntypes provides opportunities for eliminating interference of external molecular\nsources and multi-user interference (MUI), and developing new multiple access\ntechniques for MC nanonetworks. In this paper, we investigate channel sensing\nmethods that use only a single type of receptors and exploit the amount of time\nreceptors stay bound and unbound during ligand-receptor binding reaction to\nconcurrently estimate the concentration of multiple types of ligands. We derive\nthe Cram\\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for multi-ligand estimation, and propose\npractical and low-complexity suboptimal estimators for channel sensing. We\nanalyze the performance of the proposed methods in terms of normalized mean\nsquared error (NMSE), and show that they can efficiently estimate the\nconcentration of ligands up to $10$ different types with an average NMSE far\nbelow $10^{-2}$.

The main reason for this lies in the\npeculiarities of nanoscale physics, challenges in nanoscale fabrication and\nhighly stochastic nature of biochemical domain of envisioned nanonetwork\napplications. This mandates developing novel device architectures and\ncommunication methods compatible with MC constraints. To that end, various\ntransmitter and receiver designs for MC have been proposed in literature\ntogether with numerable modulation, coding and detection techniques. However,\nthese works fall into domains of a very wide spectrum of disciplines, including\nbut not limited to information and communication theory, quantum physics,\nmaterials science, nanofabrication, physiology and synthetic biology.\nTherefore, we believe it is imperative for the progress of the field that, an\norganized exposition of cumulative knowledge on subject matter be compiled.\nThus, to fill this gap, in this comprehensive survey we review the existing\nliterature on transmitter and receiver architectures towards realizing MC\namongst nanomaterial-based nanomachines and/or biological entities, and provide\na complete overview of modulation, coding and detection techniques employed for\nMC.

Resistive crossbars\noffer a highly-parallel and efficient matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM)\noperation. MVM being the most dominant operation in DNNs makes crossbars\nideally suited. However, various sources of device and circuit non-idealities\nlead to errors in the MVM output, thereby reducing DNN accuracy. Towards that\nend, we propose crossbar re-mapping strategies to mitigate line-resistance\ninduced accuracy degradation in DNNs, without having to re-train the learned\nweights, unlike most prior works. Line-resistances degrade the voltage levels\nalong the crossbar columns, thereby inducing more errors at the columns away\nfrom the drivers. We rank the DNN weights and kernels based on a sensitivity\nanalysis, and re-arrange the columns such that the most sensitive kernels are\nmapped closer to the drivers, thereby minimizing the impact of errors on the\noverall accuracy. We propose two algorithms $-$ static remapping strategy (SRS)\nand dynamic remapping strategy (DRS), to optimize the crossbar re-arrangement\nof a pre-trained DNN. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a standard\nVGG16 network trained using CIFAR10 dataset. Our results show that SRS and DRS\nlimit the accuracy degradation to 2.9\\% and 2.1\\%, respectively, compared to a\n5.6\\% drop from an as it is mapping of weights and kernels to crossbars. We\nbelieve this work brings an additional aspect for optimization, which can be\nused in tandem with existing mitigation techniques, such as in-situ\ncompensation, technology aware training and re-training approaches, to enhance\nsystem performance.\n",

In order\nto satisfy standard statistical results, individual p-bits not only need to be\nupdated sequentially, but also in order from the parent to the child nodes,\nnecessitating the use of sequencers in software implementations. In this\narticle, we first use SPICE simulations to show that an autonomous hardware\nBayesian network can operate correctly without any clocks or sequencers, but\nonly if the individual p-bits are appropriately designed. We then present a\nsimple behavioral model of the autonomous hardware illustrating the essential\ncharacteristics needed for correct sequencer-free operation. This model is also\nbenchmarked against SPICE simulations and can be used to simulate large scale\nnetworks. Our results could be useful in the design of hardware accelerators\nthat use energy efficient building blocks suited for low-level implementations\nof Bayesian networks. The autonomous massively parallel operation of our\nproposed stochastic hardware has biological relevance since neural dynamics in\nbrain is also stochastic and autonomous by nature.\n",

        "summary": "  The analog nature of computing in Memristive crossbars poses significant\nissues due to various non-idealities such as: parasitic resistances, non-linear\nI-V characteristics of the device etc. The non-idealities can have a\ndetrimental impact on the functionality i.e. computational accuracy of\ncrossbars. Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using\nanalytical techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent\nbehavior. This can not be captured using analytical (non data-dependent) models\nthereby, limiting their suitability in predicting application accuracy.\n  To address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality\nin Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately\ncaptures the data-dependent nature of non-idealities. We perform extensive\nHSPICE simulations of crossbars with different voltage and conductance\ncombinations. Following that, we train a neural network to learn the transfer\ncharacteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional\nsimulator which includes key architectural facets such as \\textit{tiling}, and\n\\textit{bit-slicing} to analyze the impact of non-idealities on the\nclassification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that GENIEx\nachieves \\textit{low} root mean square errors (RMSE) of $0.25$ and $0.7$ for\nlow and high voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the\nGENIEx errors are $7\\times$ and $12.8\\times$ better than an analytical model\nwhich can only capture the linear non-idealities. Further, using the functional\nsimulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can overestimate\nthe degradation in classification accuracy by $\\ge 10\\%$ on CIFAR-100 and\n$3.7\\%$ on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.\n",

Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) are a form of\nIMC that performs parallel searches for matched entries over a memory array for\na given input query. CAMs are widely used for data-centric applications that\ninvolve pattern matching and search functionality. To accommodate the ever\nexpanding data, it is attractive to resort to analog CAM for memory density\nimprovement. However, the digital CAM design nowadays based on standard CMOS or\nemerging nonvolatile memories (e.g., resistive storage devices) is already\nchallenging due to area, power, and cost penalties. Thus, it can be extremely\nexpensive to achieve analog CAM with those technologies due to added cell\ncomponents. As such, we propose, for the first time, a universal compact FeFET\nbased CAM design, FeCAM, with search and storage functionality enabled in\ndigital and analog domain simultaneously. By exploiting the multi-level-cell\n(MLC) states of FeFET, FeCAM can store and search inputs in either digital or\nanalog domain. We perform a device-circuit co-design of the proposed FeCAM and\nvalidate its functionality and performance using an experimentally calibrated\nFeFET model. Circuit level simulation results demonstrate that FeCAM can either\nstore continuous matching ranges or encode 3-bit data in a single CAM cell.\nWhen compared with the existing digital CMOS based CAM approaches, FeCAM is\nfound to improve both memory density by 22.4X and energy saving by 8.6/3.2X for\nanalog/digital modes, respectively. In the CAM-related application, our\nevaluations show that FeCAM can achieve 60.5X/23.1X saving in area/search\nenergy compared with conventional CMOS based CAMs.\n",

The TBN model allows one to reason about their\nbehavior through a simplified abstraction that ignores details about molecular\ncomposition, focusing on two key determinants of a system's energetics common\nto any chemical substrate: how many molecular bonds are formed, and how many\nseparate complexes exist in the system. We formulate as an integer program the\nNP-hard problem of computing stable (a.k.a., minimum energy) configurations of\na TBN: those configurations that maximize the number of bonds and complexes. We\nprovide open-source software solving this integer program. We give empirical\nevidence that this approach enables dramatically faster computation of TBN\nstable configurations than previous approaches based on SAT solvers.\nFurthermore, unlike SAT-based approaches, our integer programming formulation\ncan reason about TBNs in which some molecules have unbounded counts. These\nimprovements in turn allow us to efficiently automate verification of desired\nproperties of practical TBNs.

Finally, we evaluate\nmodel accuracy, energy and time to solution compared to other architectures.\nThe compiler achieves near optimal resource utilization of 80% across 16 Loihi\nchips for a 28-layer, 4M parameter MobileNet model with input size 128x128.

        "summary": "  Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) has been a critical component in\ncaches, routers, etc., in which density, speed, power efficiency, and\nreliability are the major design targets. There have been the conventional\nlow-write-power but bulky SRAM-based TCAM design, and also denser but less\nreliable or higher-write-power TCAM designs using nonvolatile memory (NVM)\ndevices. Meanwhile, some TCAM designs using dynamic memories have been also\nproposed. Although dynamic design TCAM is denser than CMOS SRAM TCAM and more\nreliable than NVM TCAM, the conventional row-by-row refresh operations land up\nwith a bottleneck of interference with normal TCAM activities. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a custom low-power dynamic TCAM using nanoelectromechanical\n(NEM) relay devices utilizing one-shot refresh to solve the memory refresh\nproblem. By harnessing the unique NEM relay characteristics with a proposed\nnovel cell structure, the proposed TCAM occupies a small footprint of only 3\ntransistors (with two NEM relays integrated on the top through the\nback-end-of-line process), which significantly outperforms the density of\n16-transistor SRAM-based TCAM. In addition, evaluations show that the proposed\nTCAM improves the write energy efficiency by 2.31x, 131x, and 13.5x over SRAM,\nRRAM, and FeFET TCAMs, respectively; The search energy-delay-product is\nimproved by 12.7x, 1.30x, and 2.83x over SRAM, RRAM, and FeFET TCAMs,\nrespectively.\n",

Active microdisplays typically prioritize\npixel density (and therefore resolution) over that of speed, where the most\nwidely used refresh rates fall between 25-240 Hz. Therefore, memristor-CMOS\nlogic is a promising fit for peripheral IO logic in active matrix displays. In\nthis paper, we design and implement a ternary 1-3 line decoder and a ternary\n2-9 line decoder which are used to program a seven segment LED display. SPICE\nsimulations are conducted in a 50-nm process, and the decoders are synthesized\non an Altera Cyclone IV field-programmable gate array (FPGA) development board\nwhich implements a ternary memristor model designed in Quartus II. We compare\nour hardware results to a binary coded decimal (BCD)-to-seven segment display\ndecoder, and show our memristor-CMOS approach reduces the total IO power\nconsumption by a factor of approximately 6 times at a maximum synthesizable\nfrequency of 293.77MHz. Although the speed is approximately half of the native\nbuilt-in BCD-to-seven decoder, the comparatively slow refresh rates of typical\nmicrodisplays indicate this to be a tolerable trade-off, which promotes data\ndensity over speed.\n",

Under this framework, drug carriers,\ndiseased cells, and the channel are modeled as transmitters, absorbing\nreceivers, and diffusive channel, respectively. In this paper, we investigate\ndiffusion-based spherical matrix-type drug carriers, which are employed in\nmedical applications. In a matrix carrier, the drug molecules are dispersed in\nthe matrix core and diffuse from the inner to the outer layers of the carrier\nonce immersed in a dissolution medium. We derive the channel response of the\nmatrix carrier transmitter for an absorbing receiver and compare our results\nwith commonly used point and transparent spherical transmitters to highlight\nthe necessity of considering practical models. Furthermore, we derive a\ncriterion for evaluating whether the release process or the channel dynamics\nare more important for the characteristics of the channel response of a drug\ndelivery system. For the limiting regimes, where only the release process or\nthe channel determine the behavior of the end-to-end system, we propose\nclosed-form approximations for the channel response. Finally, we investigate\nthe channel responses for the release of common therapeutic drugs, e.g.,\ndoxorubicin, from a diblock copolymer micelle acting as drug carrier.\n",

Spatio-temporal (ST) signal processing, which encompasses\nbiosignals such as electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG), is\none family of applications that could benefit from an HDC-based learning\nframework. At the core of HDC lie manipulations and comparisons of large bit\npatterns, which are inherently ill-suited to conventional computing platforms\nbased on the von-Neumann architecture. In this work, we propose an architecture\nfor ST signal processing within the HDC framework using predominantly in-memory\ncompute arrays. In particular, we introduce a methodology for the in-memory\nhyperdimensional encoding of ST data to be used together with an in-memory\nassociative search module. We show that the in-memory HDC encoder for ST\nsignals offers at least 1.80x energy efficiency gains, 3.36x area gains, as\nwell as 9.74x throughput gains compared with a dedicated digital hardware\nimplementation. At the same time it achieves a peak classification accuracy\nwithin 0.04% of that of the baseline HDC framework.\n",

However, like most other analog circuits, these\ndevices and circuits are prone to imperfections, such as temperature\ndependency, noise, tuning error, etc., often leading to considerable\nperformance degradation in neural network implementations. Indeed,\nimperfections are major obstacles in the path of further progress and ultimate\ncommercialization of these technologies. Hence, a practically viable approach\nshould be developed to deal with these nonidealities and unleash the full\npotential of nonvolatile memories in neuromorphic systems. Here, for the first\ntime, we report a comprehensive characterization of critical imperfections in\ntwo analog-grade memories, namely passively-integrated memristors and\nredesigned eFlash memories, which both feature long-term retention, high\nendurance, analog storage, low-power operation, and compact nano-scale\nfootprint. Then, we propose a holistic approach that includes modifications in\nthe training, tuning algorithm, memory state optimization, and circuit design\nto mitigate these imperfections. Our proposed methodology is corroborated on a\nhybrid software/experimental framework using two benchmarks: a moderate-size\nconvolutional neural network and ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\ndatasets, respectively. Our proposed approaches allow 2.5x to 9x improvements\nin the energy consumption of memory arrays during inference and sub-percent\naccuracy drop across 25-100 C temperature range.

However, DWM's benefits cannot address data access latency and\nthroughput limitations of memory bus bandwidth. We propose PIRM, a DWM-based\nin-memory computing solution that leverages the properties of DWM nanowires and\nallows them to serve as polymorphic gates. While normally DWM is accessed by\napplying spin polarized currents orthogonal to the nanowire at access points to\nread individual bits, transverse access along the DWM nanowire allows the\ndifferentiation of the aggregate resistance of multiple bits in the nanowire,\nakin to a multilevel cell. PIRM leverages this transverse reading to directly\nprovide bulk-bitwise logic of multiple adjacent operands in the nanowire,\nsimultaneously. Based on this in-memory logic, PIRM provides a technique to\nconduct multi-operand addition and two operand multiplication using transverse\naccess. PIRM provides a 1.6x speedup compared to the leading DRAM PIM technique\nfor query applications that leverage bulk bitwise operations. Compared to the\nleading PIM technique for DWM, PIRM improves performance by 6.9x, 2.3x and\nenergy by 5.5x, 3.4x for 8-bit addition and multiplication, respectively. For\narithmetic heavy benchmarks, PIRM reduces access latency by 2.1x, while\ndecreasing energy consumption by 25.2x for a reasonable 10% area overhead\nversus non-PIM DWM.\n",

However, the encoding density (i.e.,\nhow many binary bits can be encoded into one nucleotide) and error handling are\ntwo major factors intertwined in DNA storage. Considering encoding density,\ntheoretically, one nucleotide can encode two binary bits (upper bound).\nHowever, due to biochemical constraints and other necessary information\nassociated with payload, the encoding densities of various DNA storage systems\nare much less than this upper bound. Additionally, all existing studies of DNA\nencoding schemes are based on static analysis and really lack the awareness of\ndynamically changed digital patterns. Therefore, the gap between the static\nencoding and dynamic binary patterns prevents achieving a higher encoding\ndensity for DNA storage systems.\n  In this paper, we propose a new Digital Pattern-Aware DNA storage system,\ncalled DP-DNA, which can efficiently store digital data in DNA storage with\nhigh encoding density. DP-DNA maintains a set of encoding codes and uses a\ndigital pattern-aware code (DPAC) to analyze the patterns of a binary sequence\nfor a DNA strand and selects an appropriate code for encoding the binary\nsequence to achieve a high encoding density. An additional encoding field is\nadded to the DNA encoding format, which can distinguish the encoding scheme\nused for those DNA strands, and thus we can decode DNA data back to its\noriginal digital data. Moreover, to further improve the encoding density, a\nvariable-length scheme is proposed to increase the feasibility of the coding\nscheme with a high encoding density. Finally, the experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed DP-DNA achieves up to 103.5% higher encoding densities than\nprior work.\n",

Fundamental to these applications is the weighted addition operation\nwhich is most often implemented by a multiplexer (mux) tree. Mux-based adders\nhave very low area but typically require long bit-streams to reach practical\naccuracy thresholds when the number of summands is large. In this work, we\nfirst identify the main contributors to mux adder error. We then demonstrate\nwith analysis and experiment that two new techniques, precise sampling and full\ncorrelation, can target and mitigate these error sources. Implementing these\ntechniques in hardware leads to the design of CeMux (Correlation-enhanced\nMultiplexer), a stochastic mux adder that is significantly more accurate and\nuses much less area than traditional weighted adders. We compare CeMux to other\nSC and hybrid designs for an electrocardiogram filtering case study that\nemploys a large digital filter. One major result is that CeMux is shown to be\naccurate even for large input sizes. CeMux's higher accuracy leads to a latency\nreduction of 4x to 16x over other designs. Further, CeMux uses about 35% less\narea than existing designs, and we demonstrate that a small amount of accuracy\ncan be traded for a further 50% reduction in area.

We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,\narea-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust\nDNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical\ncontributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,\nreferred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM\ncrossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic\nalgorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to\ntrade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,\nexecution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is\nthat executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is\nprohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity\nevaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost\nby varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.\nCF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that\nmaximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal\nPareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed\nalgorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA\nachieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10\ndataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO\nalgorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular\nmulti-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from\nNSGA-II.\n",

        "summary": "  Photonic network-on-chip (PNoC) architectures employ photonic links with\ndense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) to enable high throughput on-chip\ntransfers. Unfortunately, increasing the DWDM degree (i.e., using a larger\nnumber of wavelengths) to achieve higher aggregated datarate in photonic links,\nand hence higher throughput in PNoCs, requires sophisticated and costly laser\nsources along with extra photonic hardware. This extra hardware can introduce\nundesired noise to the photonic link and increase the bit-error-rate (BER),\npower, and area consumption of PNoCs. To mitigate these issues, the use of\n4-pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) signaling, instead of the conventional\non-off keying (OOK) signaling, can halve the wavelength signals utilized in\nphotonic links for achieving the target aggregate datarate while reducing the\noverhead of crosstalk noise, BER, and photonic hardware. There are various\ndesigns of 4- PAM modulators reported in the literature. For example, the\nsignal superposition (SS), electrical digital-to-analog converter (EDAC), and\noptical digital-to-analog converter (ODAC) based designs of 4-PAM modulators\nhave been reports. However, it is yet to be explored how these SS, EDAC, and\nODAC based 4-PAM modulators can be utilized to design DWDM-based photonic links\nand PNoC architectures. In this paper, we provide an extensive link-level and\nsystem-level of the SS, EDAC, and ODAC types of 4-PAM modulators from prior\nwork with regards to their applicability and utilization overheads. From our\nlink-level and PNoC-level evaluation, we have observed that the 4-PAM EDAC\nbased variants of photonic links and PNoCs exhibit better performance and\nenergy-efficiency compared to the OOK, 4-PAM SS, and 4-PAM ODAC based links and\nPNoCs.\n",

However, the replenishment of signaling molecules at the TX\nis challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC applications,\ne.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC\nsystem, as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we\npropose the concept of media modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside\nthe channel and utilizes signaling molecules already existing inside the\nsystem. We consider signaling molecules that can be in different states which\ncan be switched by external stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, for\ninformation transmission, the TX stimulates the signaling molecules to encode\ninformation into their state. In particular, we elaborate media modulation for\nthe group of photochromic molecules, which undergo light-induced reversible\ntransformations, and study the usage of these molecules for information\ntransmission in a three-dimensional duct system. We develop a statistical model\nfor the received signal which depends on the distribution of the signaling\nmolecules in the system, the reliability of the state control mechanism, and\nthe randomness of molecule propagation. Furthermore, we analyze the performance\nof media modulation based MC in terms of the bit error rate (BER).

Once only a conceptual idea to solve physics simulations, quantum\ncomputation is today a reality, with numerous machines able to execute quantum\nalgorithms. One of the hardest challenges in quantum computing is reliability.\nQubits are highly sensitive to noise, which can make the output useless.\nMoreover, lately it has been shown that superconducting qubits are extremely\nsusceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. When\nadopted in large scale, radiation-induced errors are expected to become a\nserious challenge for qubits reliability. In this paper, we propose an\nevaluation of the impact of transient faults in the execution of quantum\ncircuits.

Cryogenic\noperation offers a promising pathway towards continued improvement in computing\nspeed and energy efficiency without aggressive scaling. However, the memory\nwall bottleneck of the traditional von-Neumann architecture persists even at\ncryogenic temperature. That is where a compute-in-memory (CiM) architecture,\nthat embeds computing within the memory unit, comes into play. Computations\nwithin the memory unit help reduce the expensive data transfer between the\nmemory and the computing units. Therefore, CiM provides extreme energy\nefficiency that can enable lower cooling cost at cryogenic temperature. In this\nwork, we demonstrate CryoCiM, a cryogenic compute-in-memory framework utilizing\na non-volatile memory system based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE).\nOur design can perform memory read/write, and universal binary logic operations\n(NAND, NOR, and XOR). We design a novel peripheral circuit assembly that can\nperform the read/write, and single-cycle in-memory logic operations. The\nutilization of a QAHE-based memory system promises robustness against process\nvariations, through the usage of topologically protected resistive states for\ndata storage. CryoCiM is the first step towards utilizing exclusively cryogenic\nphenomena to serve the dual purpose of storage and computation with ultra-low\npower (nano-watts) operations.\n",

However, for extreme-edge applications with high uncertainty,\naccess to reduced amounts of data, and where explainable decisions are\nrequired, neural networks may not provide an acceptable form of intelligence.\nBayesian reasoning can solve these concerns, but it is computationally\nexpensive and, unlike neural networks, does not translate naturally to\nmemristor-based architectures. In this work, we introduce, demonstrate\nexperimentally on a fully fabricated hybrid CMOS-memristor system, and analyze\na Bayesian machine designed for highly-energy efficient Bayesian reasoning. The\narchitecture of the machine is obtained by writing Bayes' law in a way making\nits implementation natural by the principles of distributed memory and\nstochastic computing, allowing the circuit to function using solely local\nmemory and minimal data movement. Measurements on a fabricated small-scale\nBayesian machine featuring 2,048 memristors and 30,080 transistors show the\nviability of this approach and the possibility of overcoming the challenges\nassociated with its design: the inherent imperfections of memristors, as well\nas the need to distribute very locally higher-than-nominal supply voltages. The\ndesign of a scaled-up version of the machine shows its outstanding energy\nefficiency on a real-life gesture recognition task: a gesture can be recognized\nusing 5,000 times less energy than using a microcontroller unit. The Bayesian\nmachine also features several desirable features, e.g., instant on/off\noperation, compatibility with low supply voltages, and resilience to\nsingle-event upsets.

        "summary": "  Brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is continuously gaining\nremarkable attention. It is a promising alternative to traditional\nmachine-learning approaches due to its ability to learn from little data,\nlightweight implementation, and resiliency against errors. However, HDC is\noverwhelmingly data-centric similar to traditional machine-learning algorithms.\nIn-memory computing is rapidly emerging to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck\nby eliminating data movements between compute and storage units. In this work,\nwe investigate and model the impact of imprecise in-memory computing hardware\non the inference accuracy of HDC. Our modeling is based on 14nm FinFET\ntechnology fully calibrated with Intel measurement data. We accurately model,\nfor the first time, the voltage-dependent error probability in SRAM-based and\nFeFET-based in-memory computing. Thanks to HDC's resiliency against errors, the\ncomplexity of the underlying hardware can be reduced, providing large energy\nsavings of up to 6x. Experimental results for SRAM reveal that\nvariability-induced errors have a probability of up to 39 percent. Despite such\na high error probability, the inference accuracy is only marginally impacted.\nThis opens doors to explore new tradeoffs. We also demonstrate that the\nresiliency against errors is application-dependent. In addition, we investigate\nthe robustness of HDC against errors when the underlying in-memory hardware is\nrealized using emerging non-volatile FeFET devices instead of mature CMOS-based\nSRAMs. We demonstrate that inference accuracy does remain high despite the\nlarger error probability, while large area and power savings can be obtained.\nAll in all, HW/SW co-design is the key for efficient yet reliable in-memory\nhyperdimensional computing for both conventional CMOS technology and upcoming\nemerging technologies.\n",

From multilevel graph partitioning to more general-purpose\noptimization solvers such as Gurobi and CPLEX, a wide range of approaches have\nbeen developed. Limitations of these approaches are important to study in order\nto break the computational optimization barriers of this problem.

In this work, we experiment with solving the\ngraph partitioning on the Fujitsu Digital Annealer (a special-purpose hardware\ndesigned for solving combinatorial optimization problems) and compare it with\nthe existing top solvers. We demonstrate limitations of existing solvers on\nmany dense graphs as well as those of the Digital Annealer on sparse graphs\nwhich opens an avenue to hybridize these approaches.\n",

However, digital keys are limited to binary values and\neasily exploitable when stored in standard memories. In this paper, based on\nemerging technologies, we introduce pHGen, a potential-of-hydrogen (pH)-based\nkey generation mechanism that leverages chemical reactions in the form of a\npotential change in ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs). The\nthreshold voltage of ISFETs is manipulated corresponding to a known pH buffer\nsolution (key) in which the transistors are immersed. To read the chemical\ninformation effectively via ISFETs, we designed a readout circuit for stable\noperation and detection of voltage thresholds. To demonstrate the applicability\nof the proposed key generation, we utilize pHGen for logic locking -- a\nhardware integrity protection scheme. The proposed key-generation method breaks\nthe limits of binary values and provides the first steps toward the utilization\nof multi-valued voltage thresholds of ISFETs controlled by chemical\ninformation. The pHGen approach is expected to be a turning point for using\nmore sophisticated bio-based analog keys for securing next-generation\nelectronics.\n",

Furthermore, we consider two types of transmitter (TX),\nnamely a point TX and a membrane fusion (MF)-based spherical TX. We assume the\npoint TX or the center of the MF-based TX has a fixed distance to the center of\nthe RX. Given this fixed distance, the TX can be at different locations and the\nCIR of the RX depends on the exact location of the TX. By averaging over all\npossible TX locations, we analyze the expected molecule hitting rate at the RX\nas a function of the sizes and locations of the receptors, where we assume\nmolecule degradation may occur during the propagation of the signaling\nmolecules. Notably, our analysis is valid for different numbers, a wide range\nof sizes, and arbitrary locations of the receptors, and its accuracy is\nconfirmed via particle-based simulations.

Many efforts have been\nfocused on developing new modulation techniques for MC by exploiting\ndistinguishable properties of molecules. In this paper, we investigate a\nparticular modulation scheme where the information is encoded into the\nconcentration ratio of two different types of molecules. To evaluate the\nperformance of this so-called Ratio Shift Keying (RSK) modulation, we carry out\nan information theoretical analysis and derive the capacity of the end-to-end\nMC channel where the receiver performs ratio estimation based on\nligand-receptor binding statistics in an optimal or suboptimal manner. The\nnumerical results, obtained for varying similarity between the ligand types\nemployed for ratio-encoding, and number of receptors, indicate that the RSK can\noutperform the concentration shift keying (CSK) modulation, the most common\ntechnique considered in literature, when the transmitter is power-limited. The\nresults also indicate the potential advantages of RSK over other modulation\nmethods under time-varying channel conditions, when the effects of the dynamic\nconditions are invariant to the type of the molecules.\n",

Currently, the synthesis tools pass through a number of\ncomplex design steps to realize a given biochemical protocol on a target DMF\narchitecture.

Analog in-memory\ncomputing (AIMC) with spatially instantiated synaptic weights holds high\npromise to overcome this challenge, by performing matrix-vector multiplications\n(MVMs) directly within the network weights stored on a chip to execute an\ninference workload.

Its density, power, speed, and\nreliability play a critical role in enhancing the overall system performance\nand quality of service. Conventional volatile memories, including static\nrandom-access memory (SRAM) and embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM)\nin the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, have high\nperformance and good reliability. However, the inherent leakage in both SRAM\nand eDRAM hinders further improvement towards smaller feature sizes and higher\nenergy efficiency. Although the emerging nonvolatile memories can eliminate the\nleakage efficiently, the penalties of lower speed and degraded reliability are\nsignificant. This article reveals a new opportunity towards leakage-free\nvolatile static memory beyond the known paradigms of existing volatile and\nnonvolatile memories. By engineering a double-well energy landscape with the\nassistance of a clamping voltage bias, leakage-free and refresh-free state\nretention of volatile memory is achieved for the first time. This new memory is\nhighlighted by both the ultra-low leakage of nonvolatile memories and the\nspeed, energy, and reliability advantages of volatile memories. A\nproof-of-concept memory is demonstrated using in-house anti-ferroelectric\nfield-effect transistors (AFeFETs), delivering an extrapolated endurance of\nabout 1012 cycles, a retention time of over 10 years, and no subthreshold\nchannel leakage current. Such a new concept of AFeFET-based memory enables an\nimproved balance between density, power, and reliability beyond all existing\nmemory solutions.\n",

One\nparticular branch of this effort that has seen some recent rapid advances is\nIsing machines. Some Ising machines are already showing better performance and\nenergy efficiency for optimization problems. Through design iterations and\nco-evolution between hardware and algorithm, we expect more benefits from\nnature-based computing systems. In this paper, we make a case for an augmented\nIsing machine suitable for both training and inference using an energy-based\nmachine learning algorithm. We show that with a small change, the Ising\nsubstrate accelerate key parts of the algorithm and achieve non-trivial speedup\nand efficiency gain. With a more substantial change, we can turn the machine\ninto a self-sufficient gradient follower to virtually complete training\nentirely in hardware.

Ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) are a promising\ncandidate for implementing TCAM owing to their high ON/OFF ratio,\nnon-volatility, and CMOS compatibility. However, conventional single-gate\nFeFETs (SG-FeFETs) suffer from relatively high write voltage, low endurance,\npotential read disturbance, and face scaling challenges. Recently, a\ndouble-gate FeFET (DG-FeFET) has been proposed and outperforms SG-FeFETs in\nmany aspects. This paper investigates TCAM design challenges specific to\nDG-FeFETs and introduces a novel 1.5T1Fe TCAM design based on DG-FeFETs. A\n2-step search with early termination is employed to reduce the cell area and\nimprove energy efficiency. A shared driver design is proposed to reduce the\nperipherals area. Detailed analysis and SPICE simulation show that the 1.5T1Fe\nDG-TCAM leads to superior search speed and energy efficiency.

To address both issues, we propose to adopt a read disturb-free\ndual-port FeFET where write is performed on the gate featuring a ferroelectric\nlayer and the read is done on a separate gate featuring a non-ferroelectric\ndielectric.

A variety of receiver architectures based on chemical\nreaction networks (CRNs) and gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) has been\nintroduced in the literature, because cells use these concepts to perform\ncomputations in nature. However, practical feasibility is still limited by\nstochastic fluctuations of chemical reactions and long computation times in\nGRNs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two receiver designs based on\nstochastic CRNs, i.e., CRNs that perform computations by exploiting the\nintrinsic fluctuations of chemical reactions with very low molecule counts. The\nfirst CRN builds on a recent result from chemistry that showed how Boltzmann\nmachines (BMs), a commonly used machine learning model, can be implemented with\nCRNs. We show that BMs with optimal parameter values and their CRN\nimplementations can act as maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) detectors. Furthermore,\nwe show that BMs can be efficiently trained from simulation data to achieve\nclose-to-MAP performance. While this approach yields a fixed CRN once deployed,\nour second approach based on a manually designed CRN can be trained with pilot\nsymbols even within the cell and thus adapt to changing channel conditions.

Through image classification neural network\nsimulations, we demonstrate that misclassified images under low illumination\nare primarily difficult-to-classify cases.

Besides, a comprehensive evaluation is performed on a 128x128 FeFET\nAND-type memory array in terms of area, latency, power and throughput.

        "summary": "  Stochastic computing is a paradigm in which logical operations are performed\non randomly generated bit streams. Complex arithmetic operations can be\nexecuted by simple logic circuits, resulting in a much smaller area footprint\ncompared to conventional binary counterparts. However, the random or\npseudorandom sources required for generating the bit streams are costly in\nterms of area and offset the advantages. Additionally, due to the inherent\nrandomness, the computation lacks precision, limiting the applicability of this\nparadigm. Importantly, achieving reasonable accuracy in stochastic computing\ninvolves high latency. Recently, deterministic approaches to stochastic\ncomputing have been proposed, demonstrating that randomness is not a\nrequirement. By structuring the computation deterministically, exact results\ncan be obtained, and the latency greatly reduced. The bit stream generated\nadheres to a \"unary\" encoding, retaining the non-positional nature of the bits\nwhile discarding the random bit generation of traditional stochastic computing.\nThis deterministic approach overcomes many drawbacks of stochastic computing,\nalthough the latency increases quadratically with each level of logic, becoming\nunmanageable beyond a few levels. In this paper, we present a method for\napproximating the results of the deterministic method while maintaining low\nlatency at each level. This improvement comes at the cost of additional logic,\nbut we demonstrate that the increase in area scales with the square root of n,\nwhere n represents the equivalent number of binary bits of precision. Our new\napproach is general, efficient, composable, and applicable to all arithmetic\noperations performed with stochastic logic. We show that this approach\noutperforms other stochastic designs for matrix multiplication (dot-product),\nwhich is an integral step in nearly all machine learning algorithms.\n",

In\ncontrast to existing research that primarily focuses on optimizing execution\nenergy, our findings reveal that the memristor's initialization energy in the\nMAGIC design style is, on average, 68x higher.

Global\nentanglement distribution over LEO and VLEO satellites network must reckon with\nsatellite movement over time. Current studies do not fully capture the dynamic\nnature of satellite constellations. We model a dynamic LEO/VLEO satellite\nnetwork as a time-varying graph and construct a sequence of static graphs to\nrepresent a dynamic network. We study the entanglement distribution problem\nbetween a set of source-destination node pairs in this dynamic network\nutilizing Multi-commodity Flow (MCF). Solving MCF over a sequence of graphs\nindependently for each graph may produce a completely different set of paths.\nChanging the set of paths every time the graph topology changes may involve a\nsignificant amount of overhead, as an established set of paths must be taken\ndown and a new set of paths established. We propose a technique that will avoid\nthis overhead by computing only one set of paths P to be used over all the\ngraphs in the sequence. The degraded performance offered by P may be viewed as\nthe cost of using P. The benefit of using P is the overhead cost of path\nswitching that can be avoided. We provide a cost-benefit analysis in a LEO/VLEO\nconstellation for entanglement distribution between multiple source-destination\npairs.

Assuming continuous vesicle\ngeneration at the TX and a transparent receiver (RX), we calculate the molecule\nrelease rate, the fraction of absorbed molecules at the TX, and the received\nsignal at the RX. All obtained analytical expressions are functions of all\nreceptors locations and sizes, and are validated by particle-based simulations.\nOur numerical results indicate that evenly distributed receptors on the TX\nmembrane can absorb more molecules than randomly distributed receptors or a\nsingle receptor. Furthermore, inspired by the autoreceptor functionality in\nsynaptic communication, we incorporate a negative feedback mechanism (NFM) at\nthe TX, such that molecule release stops after a certain period. We then derive\nthe fraction of molecules that can be reused for the subsequent emissions when\nconsidering both NFM and molecule harvesting. Our numerical results demonstrate\nthat incorporating NFM can reduce inter-symbol interference (ISI) while\nmaintaining the same peak received signal as the case without NFM.\nAdditionally, our results show that TXs incorporating both molecule harvesting\nand NFM can achieve a higher energy efficiency and lower error probability than\nTXs employing only molecule harvesting or neither functionality.\n",

        "summary": "  In literature, NAND and NOR are two logic gates that display functional\ncompleteness, hence regarded as Universal gates. So, the present effort is\nfocused on exploring a library of universal gates in binary that are still\nunexplored in literature along with a broad and systematic approach to classify\nthe logic connectives. The study shows that the number of Universal Gates in\nany logic system grows exponentially with the number of input variables $N$. It\nis revealed that there are $56$ Universal gates in binary for $N=3$. It is\nshown that the ratio of the count of Universal gates to the total number of\nLogic gates is $\\approx $ $\\frac{1}{4}$ or 0.25. Adding constants $0,1$ allow\nfor the creation of $4$ additional (for $N=2$) and $169$ additional Universal\nGates (for $N=3$). In this article, the mathematical and logical underpinnings\nof the concept of universal logic gates are presented, along with a search\nstrategy $ULG_{SS}$ exploring multiple paths leading to their identification. A\nfast-track approach has been introduced that uses the hexadecimal\nrepresentation of a logic gate to quickly ascertain its attribute.\n",

        "summary": "  The role of axonal synaptic delays in the efficacy and performance of\nartificial neural networks has been largely unexplored. In step-based\nanalog-valued neural network models (ANNs), the concept is almost absent. In\ntheir spiking neuroscience-inspired counterparts, there is hardly a systematic\naccount of their effects on model performance in terms of accuracy and number\nof synaptic operations.This paper proposes a methodology for accounting for\naxonal delays in the training loop of deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs),\nintending to efficiently solve machine learning tasks on data with rich\ntemporal dependencies. We then conduct an empirical study of the effects of\naxonal delays on model performance during inference for the Adding task, a\nbenchmark for sequential regression, and for the Spiking Heidelberg Digits\ndataset (SHD), commonly used for evaluating event-driven models. Quantitative\nresults on the SHD show that SNNs incorporating axonal delays instead of\nexplicit recurrent synapses achieve state-of-the-art, over 90% test accuracy\nwhile needing less than half trainable synapses. Additionally, we estimate the\nrequired memory in terms of total parameters and energy consumption of\naccomodating such delay-trained models on a modern neuromorphic accelerator.\nThese estimations are based on the number of synaptic operations and the\nreference GF-22nm FDX CMOS technology. As a result, we demonstrate that a\nreduced parameterization, which incorporates axonal delays, leads to\napproximately 90% energy and memory reduction in digital hardware\nimplementations for a similar performance in the aforementioned task.\n",

Due to their critical\nsignificance and the inability of conventional hardware in efficiently handling\nscaled COPs, there is a growing interest in developing computing hardware\ntailored specifically for COPs, including digital annealers, dynamical Ising\nmachines, and quantum/photonic systems. However, significant hurdles still\nremain, such as the memory access issue, the system scalability and restricted\napplicability to certain types of COPs, and VLSI-incompatibility, respectively.\nHere, a ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) based compute-in-memory\n(CiM) annealer is proposed. After converting COPs into quadratic unconstrained\nbinary optimization (QUBO) formulations, a hardware-algorithm co-design is\nconducted, yielding an energy-efficient, versatile, and scalable hardware for\nCOPs. To accelerate the core vector-matrix-vector (VMV) multiplication of QUBO\nformulations, a FeFET based CiM array is exploited, which can accelerate the\nintended operation in-situ due to its unique three-terminal structure. In\nparticular, a lossless compression technique is proposed to prune typically\nsparse QUBO matrix to reduce hardware cost. Furthermore, a multi-epoch\nsimulated annealing (MESA) algorithm is proposed to replace conventional\nsimulated annealing for its faster convergence and better solution quality. The\neffectiveness of the proposed techniques is validated through the utilization\nof developed chip prototypes for successfully solving graph coloring problem,\nindicating great promise of FeFET CiM annealer in solving general COPs.\n",

The proposed system is designed to be\nbiocompatible, resource-efficient, and controllable from outside the tube. As\nsignaling molecule, the testbed employs the green fluorescent protein variant\n\"Dreiklang\" (GFPD). GFPDs can be reversibly switched via light of different\nwavelengths between a bright fluorescent state and a less fluorescent state.\nHence, this property allows for writing and erasing information encoded in the\nstate of the GFPDs already present in the fluid via radiation from outside the\ntube. The concept of modulating the GFPDs existing in the channel at the\ntransmitter for information transmission, instead of releasing new molecules,\nis a form of media modulation. In our testbed, due to the closed loop setup and\nthe long experiment durations of up to 250 min, we observe new forms of\ninter-symbol interferences (ISI), which do not occur in short experiments and\nopen loop systems.

This paper introduces a novel deep joint source-channel coding\n(DJSCC) scheme for DNA image storage, designated as DJSCC-DNA.

The performance of the proposed model is demonstrated via\nnumerical results from specific channel testing, suggesting that it surpasses\nconventional deep learning methodologies in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio\n(PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM).

However, due to\nits immaturity, ReRAM devices often suffer from various reliability issues,\nwhich hinder the practicality of the PIM architecture and lead to a severe\ndegradation in DNN accuracy. Among various reliability issues, device variation\nand offset current from High Resistance State (HRS) cell have been considered\nas major problems in a ReRAM based PIM architecture. Due to these problems, the\nthroughput of the ReRAM based PIM is reduced as fewer wordlines are activated.\nIn this paper, we propose VECOM, a novel approach that includes a variation\nresilient encoding technique and an offset compensation scheme for a robust\nReRAM based PIM architecture. The first technique (i.e., VECOM encoding) is\nbuilt based on the analysis of the weight pattern distribution of DNN models,\nalong with the insight into the ReRAM's variation property. The second\ntechnique, VECOM offset compensation, tolerates offset current in PIM by\nmapping the conductance of each Multi level Cell (MLC) level added with a\nspecific offset conductance. Experimental results in various DNN models and\ndatasets show that the proposed techniques can increase the throughput of the\nPIM architecture by up to 9.1 times while saving 50% of energy consumption\nwithout any software overhead. Additionally, VECOM is also found to endure low\nR ratio ReRAM cell (up to 7) with a negligible accuracy drop.\n",

Low latency and energy efficiency are key requirements in edge devices\nsuch as drones and autonomous vehicles. Monolithic 3D (MONO3D) is an emerging\n3D integration technique that offers ultra-high bandwidth among processing and\nmemory elements with a negligible area overhead. Such high bandwidth can help\nmeet the ever-growing latency and energy efficiency demands for DNNs. This\npaper presents a novel implementation for weight stationary (WS) dataflow in\nMONO3D systolic arrays, called WS-MONO3D. WS-MONO3D utilizes multiple resistive\nRAM layers and SRAM with high-density vertical interconnects to multicast\ninputs and perform high-bandwidth weight pre-loading while maintaining the same\norder of multiply-and-accumulate operations as in native WS dataflow.\nConsequently, WS-MONO3D eliminates input and weight forwarding cycles and,\nthus, provides up to 40% improvement in energy-delay-product (EDP) over the\nnative WS implementation in 2D at iso-configuration. WS-MONO3D also provides\n10X improvement in inference per second per watt per footprint due to multiple\nvertical tiers. Finally, we also show that temperature impacts the energy\nefficiency benefits in WS-MONO3D.\n",

This feature forces the introduction of\npath-balancing flip-flops to ensure proper synchronization of inputs at each\ngate. This paper proposes a polynomial time complexity approximation algorithm\nfor clocking assignments that minimizes the insertion of path balancing buffers\nfor multi-threaded multi-phase clocking of SFQ circuits. Existing SFQ\nmulti-phase clocking solutions have been shown to effectively reduce the number\nof required buffers inserted while maintaining high throughput, however, the\nassociated clock assignment algorithms have exponential complexity and can have\nprohibitively long runtimes for large circuits, limiting the scalability of\nthis approach. Our proposed algorithm is based on a linear program (LP) that\nleads to solutions that are experimentally on average within 5% of the optimum\nand helps accelerate convergence towards the optimal integer linear program\n(ILP) based solution. The improved LP and ILP runtimes permit multi-phase\nclocking schemes to scale to larger SFQ circuits than previous state of the art\nclocking assignment methods. We further extend the existing algorithm to\nsupport fanout sharing of the added buffers, saving, on average, an additional\n10% of the inserted DFFs. Compared to traditional full path balancing (FPB)\nmethods across 10 benchmarks, our enhanced LP saves 79.9%, 87.8%, and 91.2% of\nthe inserted buffers for 2, 3, and 4 clock phases respectively. Finally, we\nextend this approach to the generation of circuits that completely mitigate\npotential hold-time violations at the cost of either adding on average less\nthan 10% more buffers (for designs with 3 or more clock phases) or, more\ngenerally, adding a clock phase and thereby reducing throughput.\n",

Under an \"adversarial\" model in which reaction rates can vary\narbitrarily over time, it was found that exactly the continuous, piecewise\nlinear functions can be computed, ruling out even simple functions such as\n$f(x) = x^2$. In contrast, in this paper we show that inhibitory CRNs can\ncompute any computable function $f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}$.\n",

Due to impaired neurotransmitter-based\ninformation transmission in PD, molecular communication-based approaches can be\nemployed as potential solutions to address this issue. Molecular Communications\n(MC) is a bio-inspired communication method utilizing molecules for carrying\ninformation. This mode of communication stands out for developing\nbio-compatible nanomachines for diagnosing and treating, particularly in\naddressing neurodegenerative diseases like PD, due to its compatibility with\nbiological systems. This study presents a novel treatment method that\nintroduces an Intelligent Dopamine Rate Modulator (IDRM), which is located in\nthe synaptic gap between the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum\nto compensate for insufficiency dopamine release in BG caused by PD. For\nstoring dopamine in the IDRM, dopamine compound (DAC) is swallowed and crossed\nthrough the digestive system, blood circulatory system, blood-brain barrier\n(BBB), and brain extracellular matrix uptakes with IDRMs. Here, the DAC\nconcentration is calculated in these regions, revealing that the required\nexogenous dopamine consistently reaches IDRM. Therefore, the perpetual dopamine\ninsufficiency in BG associated with PD can be compensated. This method reduces\ndrug side effects because dopamine is not released in other brain regions.\nUnlike other treatments, this approach targets the root cause of PD rather than\njust reducing symptoms.\n",

This is measureable in the exponential growth of data processed by\nICT, e.g. ICT for cryptocurrency mining and search engines. So far, the energy\ndemand for computing technology has increased by a factor of 1.38 every ten\nyears due to the exponentially increasing use of ICT systems as computing\ndevices. The energy consumption of ICT systems is expected to rise from 1500\nTWh (8% of global electricity consumption) in 2010 to 5700 TWh (14% of global\nelectricity consumption) in 2030. A large part of this energy is required for\nthe continuous data transfer between the separated memory and processor units\nwhich constitute the main components of ICT computing devices in von-Neumann\narchitecture. This at the same time massively slows down the computing power of\nICT systems in the von-Neumann architecture.

One candidate for the implementation of such devices are\nengineered cells due to their inherent biocompatibility. However, because each\nengineered cell has only little computational capabilities, transmitter and\nreceiver (RX) functionalities can afford only limited complexity. In this\npaper, we propose a simple, yet modular, architecture for a cellular RX that is\ncapable of processing a stream of observed symbols using chemical reaction\nnetworks. Furthermore, we propose two specific detector implementations for the\nRX. The first detector is based on a machine learning model that is trained\noffline, i.e., before the cellular RX is deployed. The second detector utilizes\npilot symbol-based training and is therefore able to continuously adapt to\nchanging channel conditions online, i.e., after deployment. To coordinate the\ndifferent chemical processing steps involved in symbol detection, the proposed\ncellular RX leverages an internal chemical timer. Furthermore, the RX is\nsynchronized with the transmitter via external, i.e., extracellular, signals.\nFinally, the proposed architecture is validated using theoretical analysis and\nstochastic simulations. The presented results confirm the feasibility of both\nproposed implementations and reveal that the proposed online learning-based RX\nis able to perform reliable detection even in initially unknown or slowly\nchanging channels. By its modular design and exclusively chemical\nimplementation, the proposed RX contributes towards the realization of\nversatile and biocompatible nano-scale communication networks for IoBNT\napplications narrowing the existing implementation gap in cellular molecular\ncommunication (MC).\n",

Yet, due to\nmanufacturing limitations, current RRAM devices are highly susceptible to\nhardware defects, which poses a significant challenge to their practical\napplicability. In this paper, we present a machine learning technique that\nenables the deployment of defect-prone RRAM accelerators for DNN applications,\nwithout necessitating modifying the hardware, retraining of the neural network,\nor implementing additional detection circuitry/logic. The key idea involves\nincorporating a drop-connect inspired approach during the training phase of a\nDNN, where random subsets of weights are selected to emulate fault effects\n(e.g., set to zero to mimic stuck-at-1 faults), thereby equipping the DNN with\nthe ability to learn and adapt to RRAM defects with the corresponding fault\nrates. Our results demonstrate the viability of the drop-connect approach,\ncoupled with various algorithm and system-level design and trade-off\nconsiderations. We show that, even in the presence of high defect rates (e.g.,\nup to 30%), the degradation of DNN accuracy can be as low as less than 1%\ncompared to that of the fault-free version, while incurring minimal\nsystem-level runtime/energy costs.\n",

We\nutilize QREChem to provide logical resource estimates for a variety of small\nmolecules in various basis sets, obtaining estimates in the range of\n$10^7-10^{15}$ for total number of T gates.

In this paper, we investigate a novel localization approach\nfor future computing by presenting QuERLoc, the first study on localization\nusing quantum-enhanced ranging. By fine-tuning the evolution of an entangled\nquantum probe, quantum ranging can output the information integrated in the\nprobe as a specific mapping of distance-related parameters. QuERLoc is inspired\nby this unique property to measure a special combination of distances between a\ntarget sensor and multiple anchors within one single physical measurement.\nLeveraging this capability, QuERLoc settles two drawbacks of classical\nlocalization approaches: (i) the target-anchor distances must be measured\nindividually and sequentially, and (ii) the resulting optimization problems are\nnon-convex and are sensitive to noise. We first present the theoretical\nformulation of preparing the probing quantum state and controlling its dynamic\nto induce a convexified localization problem, and then solve it efficiently via\noptimization. We conduct extensive numerical analysis of QuERLoc under various\nsettings. The results show that QuERLoc consistently outperforms classical\napproaches in accuracy and closely follows the theoretical lowerbound, while\nmaintaining low time complexity. It achieves a minimum reduction of 73% in RMSE\nand 97.6% in time consumption compared to baselines.

Ising models are instrumental in\ntackling many combinatorial optimization problems, leading to significant\nresearch in developing solvers for them.

This paper introduces unit Ising models, where all\nnon-zero coefficients of linear and quadratic terms are either $-1$ or $+1$.\nDue to the limited resolution of quantum annealers, unit Ising models are more\nsuitable for quantum annealers to find optimal solutions. We propose a novel\ndesign methodology for unit Ising models to simulate logic circuits computing\nBoolean functions through integer linear programming. By optimizing these Ising\nmodels with quantum annealers, we can compute Boolean functions and their\ninverses. With a fixed unit Ising model for a logic circuit, we can potentially\ndesign Application-Specific Unit Quantum Annealers (ASUQAs) for computing the\ninverse function, which is analogous to Application-Specific Integrated\nCircuits (ASICs) in digital circuitry.

By integrating\nprobability into the knowledge graph, we enable probabilistic semantic\ncommunication (PSC) and represent semantic information accordingly. On this\nbasis, a semantic compression model designed for multi-user downlink\ntask-oriented communication is introduced, utilizing the semantic compression\nratio (SCR) as a parameter to connect the computation and communication\nprocesses of information transmission. Based on the rate-splitting multiple\naccess (RSMA) technology, we derive mathematical expressions for system\ntransmission energy consumption and related formulations. Subsequently, the\nmulti-user green semantic communication system is modeled and the optimal\nproblem with the goal of minimizing system energy consumption comprehensively\nconsidering the computation and communication process under given constrains is\nformulated. In order to address the optimal problem, we propose an alternating\noptimization algorithm that tackles sub-problems of power allocation and\nbeamforming design, semantic compression ratio, and computation capacity\nallocation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach,\ndemonstrating the superiority of our system over methods using Space Division\nMultiple Access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) instead of\nRSMA, and highlighting the benefits of our PSC compression model.\n",

Comparative analysis with three state-of-the-art\nbaselines on real dataset shows that our WCB framework achieves 1.4 times\nbetter volunteer satisfaction and a 20% higher task retention rate, with only a\n12% increase in remuneration. The effectiveness of the proposed WCB approach is\nto enhance the volunteer engagement and their long-term retention, thus making\nit suitable for functioning of social good applications where a potential and\nskilled volunteer workforce is crucial for sustainable community services.\n",

In\norder to fully leverage the capabilities of this new generation of ANNs,\noptimization algorithms that take into account hardware limitations and\nimperfections are necessary. Photonics represents a particularly promising\nplatform, offering scalability, high speed, energy efficiency, and the\ncapability for parallel information processing.

        "summary": "  The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to significant\ndata reliability and system transparency challenges, aggravated by the\ncentralized nature of existing IoT architectures. This centralization often\nresults in siloed data ecosystems, where interoperability issues and opaque\ndata handling practices compromise both the utility and trustworthiness of IoT\napplications. To address these issues, we introduce ZONIA (Zero-trust Oracle\nNetwork for IoT Applications), a novel blockchain oracle system designed to\nenhance data integrity and decentralization in IoT environments. Unlike\ntraditional approaches that rely on Trusted Execution Environments and\ncentralized data sources, ZONIA utilizes a decentralized, zero-trust model that\nallows for anonymous participation and integrates multiple data sources to\nensure fairness and reliability. This paper outlines ZONIA's architecture,\nwhich supports semantic and geospatial queries, details its data reliability\nmechanisms, and presents a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating its\nscalability and resilience against data falsification and collusion attacks.\nBoth analytical and experimental results demonstrate ZONIA's scalability,\nshowcasing its feasibility to handle an increasing number of nodes in the\nsystem under different system conditions and workloads. Furthermore, the\nimplemented reputation mechanism significantly enhances data accuracy,\nmaintaining high reliability even when 40\\% of nodes exhibit malicious\nbehavior.\n",

These designs perform MAC\noperations of partial input and weight, with the corresponding partial products\nthen fed into shift-add circuitry to produce the final MAC results. However,\nexisting works often present intricate shift-add process for weight. The\ntraditional digital shift-add process is limited in throughput due to\ntime-multiplexing of ADCs, and advancing the shift-add process to the analog\ndomain necessitates customized circuit implementations, resulting in\ncompromises in energy and area efficiency.

Although the IR drop\nissue has been extensively investigated, the impact of transistor leakage\ncurrent has received limited attention. In this work, we investigate both\nissues and highlight how transistor leakage in 1T1R arrays has effects similar\nto IR drop, which degrades the memory cell sensing margin, especially as the\ntechnology node scales down. This degradation could pose reliability concerns,\nparticularly where the on/off ratio or sensing margin of memristors is\ncritical. We characterized the joint effects of transistor read resistance,\ntransistor leakage current, and IR drop as the array size scales up and the\nfabrication node scales down. Based on a model developed using specifications\nof a 22nm FDSOI technology, we found that an optimal resistance range of\nmemristors exists for good array scaling capability, where the transistor read\nresistance and the IR drop issue establish a lower resistance boundary, while\nthe transistor leakage issue sets an upper resistance boundary.

However, BNNs pose an additional challenge -- they require multiple\ninstantiations for ensembling, consuming extra resources in terms of energy and\narea. In this work, we propose a novel sparsity-aware optimization for Bayesian\nBinary Neural Network (BBNN) accelerators that exploits the inherent BBNN\nsampling sparsity -- most of the network is made up of synapses that have a\nhigh probability of being fixed at $\\pm1$ and require no sampling. The\noptimization scheme proposed here exploits the sampling sparsity that exists\nboth among layers, i.e only a few layers of the network contain a majority of\nthe probabilistic synapses, as well as the parameters i.e., a tiny fraction of\nparameters in these layers require sampling, reducing total sampled parameter\ncount further by up to $86\\%$. We demonstrate no loss in accuracy or\nuncertainty quantification performance for a VGGBinaryConnect network on\nCIFAR-100 dataset mapped on a custom sparsity-aware phase change memory (PCM)\nbased IMC simulator. We also develop a simple drift compensation technique to\ndemonstrate robustness to drift-induced degradation.

Our proposal is inspired by Golgi's theory modeling the brain\nas a syncytial continuum, in contrast to Cajal's theory of neurons and synapses\nbeing discrete elements. While Cajal's theory has long been the dominant and\nexperimentally validated view of the nervous system, recent discoveries showed\nthat a species of marine invertebrate (ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi) may be\nbetter described by Golgi's theory.

Standard simulation tools encounter difficulties in\neffectively modeling the behavior of integrated iontronic components,\nhighlighting the need for specialized design and simulation approaches. This\npaper presents a design methodology for iontronic integrated circuits, inspired\nby well-established electronic design methodologies and made possible by the\ndevelopment of a compact model for the iontronic bipolar diode. Grounded in the\ndiode's physical properties and observed behavior, this model provides a\nconceptual framework that could be applied to other iontronic components. It is\nimplemented using standard VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) electronic\ndesign tools, enabling simulations that demonstrate diode-based iontronic\ncircuit behaviors and laying the groundwork for the design and simulation of\nhybrid systems integrating electronic and iontronic circuits. The proposed\niontronic circuit simulation approach enables the exploration of how component\nuniformity influences circuit behavior, as well as the impact of diode\nparameters and a deeper understanding of diode characteristics from a circuit\nperspective. These insights are expected to contribute to the development of\nmore complex and efficient iontronic circuits, bringing us closer to practical\nand groundbreaking applications in the field.\n",

The superparamagnetic tunnel junction (SMTJ), a key device in\nprobabilistic computing, is known to naturally exhibit exponentially\ndistributed temporal switching dynamics. To sample an exponential distribution\nwith an SMTJ, we need to measure it in the time domain, which is challenging\nwith traditional techniques that focus on sampling the instantaneous state of\nthe device. In this work, we leverage a temporal encoding scheme, where\ninformation is encoded in the time at which the device switches between its\nresistance states. We then develop a circuit element known as a probabilistic\ndelay cell that applies an electrical current step to an SMTJ and a temporal\nmeasurement circuit that measures the timing of the first switching event.\nRepeated experiments confirm that these times are exponentially distributed.\nTemporal processing methods then allow us to digitally compute with these\nexponentially distributed probabilistic delay cells. We describe how to use\nthese circuits in a Metropolis-Hastings stepper and in a weighted random\nsampler, both of which are computationally intensive applications that benefit\nfrom the efficient generation of exponentially distributed random numbers.\n",

However, the high cost and under-utilization of\nquantum resources are prompting a shift from single-user to multi-user access\nmodels. In a multi-tenant environment, where multiple users share one quantum\ncomputer, protecting user confidentiality becomes crucial. The varied uses of\nquantum computers increase the risk that sensitive data encoded by one user\ncould be compromised by others, rendering the protection of data integrity and\nconfidentiality essential. In the evolving quantum computing landscape, it is\nimperative to study these security challenges within the scope of realistic\nthreat model assumptions, wherein an adversarial user can mount practical\nattacks without relying on any heightened privileges afforded by physical\naccess to a quantum computer or rogue cloud services. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the potential of crosstalk as an attack vector for the first time\non a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine, that an adversarial user\ncan exploit within a multi-tenant quantum computing model. The proposed\nside-channel attack is conducted with minimal and realistic adversarial\nprivileges, with the overarching aim of uncovering the quantum algorithm being\nexecuted by a victim. Crosstalk signatures are used to estimate the presence of\nCNOT gates in the victim circuit, and subsequently, this information is encoded\nand classified by a graph-based learning model to identify the victim quantum\nalgorithm.

We show that leveraging all\npossible ratios in a set of molecules can help mitigate the effects of\nintersymbol interference (ISI) and provide a flexible communication channel.

We then assess MRSK performance both\nanalytically and through particle-based simulations under various channel\nconditions, identifying potential sources of error in our system model.\nAdditionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of commonly used modulation\nschemes in the literature based on bit error rate (BER). The results show that\nMRSK significantly outperforms all traditional modulation schemes considered in\nthis study in terms of BER.

A resting cell excites if it has\nat least one excited neighbour; the cell precipitates if a ratio of excited\ncells in its neighbourhood to its number of neighbours exceed certain\nthreshold. To approximate a Voronoi diagram on Voronoi automata we project a\nplanar set onto automaton lattice, thus cells corresponding to data-points are\nexcited. Excitation waves propagate across the Voronoi automaton, interact with\neach other and form precipitate in result of the interaction. Configuration of\nprecipitate represents edges of approximated Voronoi diagram. We discover\nrelation between quality of Voronoi diagram approximation and precipitation\nthreshold, and demonstrate feasibility of our model in approximation Voronoi\ndiagram of arbitrary-shaped objects and a skeleton of a planar shape.\n",

So yes, in a\ncomputational sense, the aTAM is quite powerful! However, if one completely\nremoves this cooperativity condition (a.k.a., temperature 1 self-assembly),\nthen the computational \"power\" of the aTAM (i.e., its ability to support Turing\nuniversal computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \\times N$ squares)\nbecomes unknown. On the plus side, the aTAM, at temperature 1, isn't only\nTuring universal but also supports the efficient self-assembly $N \\times N$\nsquares if self-assembly is allowed to utilize three spatial dimensions (Fu,\nSchweller and Cook, SODA 2011). We investigate the theoretical \"power\" of a\nseemingly simple, restrictive class of tile assembly systems (TASs) in which\n(1) the absolute value of every glue strength is 1, (2) there's a single\nnegative strength glue type and (3) unequal glues can't interact. We call these\nthe \\emph{restricted glue} TASs (rgTAS). We first show the tile complexity of\nproducing an $N \\times N$ square with an rgTAS is $O(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log\nn})$. We also prove that rgTASs are Turing universal with a construction that\nsimulates an arbitrary Turing machine. Next, we provide results for a variation\nof the rgTAS class, partially restricted glue TASs, which is similar except\nthat the magnitude of the negative glue's strength can only assumed to be $\\ge\n1$. These results consist of a construction with $O(\\log n)$ tile complexity\nfor building $N \\times N$ squares, and one which simulates a Turing machine but\nwith a greater scaling factor than for the rgTAS construction.\n",

        "summary": "  From the initial 1997 specification to the undergoing IEEE 802.11ac\nstandardization, a leap in throughput has been observed with every new\ngeneration. The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,\nrange, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a\nchallenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of\nphysical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting\nexploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied\ncross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac\nstandard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge\nbetween PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in\ncollision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly\ninvolved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC\nmechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such\nfunctionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac\nspecifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for\nthe IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output\n(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,\nneeds both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented\ncross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it\nwith the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate\nthe 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO\nsolutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel\nsounding interval has particularly been studied. Finally, we have proposed a\nshort PHY layer version of acknowledgment frames for overhead reduction in IEEE\n802.11ah communications.\n",

        "summary": "  The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known and challenging\ncombinatorial optimisation problem. Its computational intractability has\nattracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not\noptimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple\nunconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a\nvirtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the\nmaterial emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles\nmoving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a\nset of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations,\nand the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it\nmorphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage\nprocess automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all\ncities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is\nelicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated\ndatasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean\nbest tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour\nlength of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an\nexact TSP solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob\nconstructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and\ndiscuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group\npoints on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially\nrepresented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between\nthis method and previously suggested models of human performance on the TSP and\nsuggest possibilities for further improvement.\n",

In our proposal, the receiver, acting\nas a control node, sends a connection setup signal to the transmitter, which\nstokes molecules, to start molecule transmission. The molecules transmitted by\nthe transmitter propagate in the environment and are absorbed by the receiver\nthrough its receptors. When the receiver absorbs the desired quantity of\nmolecules, it releases a tear-down signal to notify the transmitter to stop the\ntransmission. The proposed protocol implements a bidirectional communication by\nusing a number of techniques originally designed for the TCP. In fact, the\nproposed protocol is connection-oriented, and uses the TCP-like probing to find\na suitable transmission rate between transmitter and receiver so as to avoid\nreceiver congestion. Unlike the TCP, however, explicit acknowledgments are not\nused, since they would degrade the communication throughput due to the large\ndelay, a characteristic feature of molecular communications. Thus, the proposed\nprotocol uses implicit acknowledgments, and feedback signals are sent by the\nreceiver to throttle the transmission rate at the transmitter, i.e., explicit\nnegative feedbacks. We also present the results of an extensive simulation\ncampaign, used to validate the proposed protocol and to properly dimension the\nmain protocol parameters.\n",

Each node of the actin\nautomaton takes state `0' (resting) or `1' (excited) and updates its state in\ndiscrete time depending on its neighbour's states.

The number of synaptic\nconnections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of\nconnections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find\nthe best 'combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error.\nHence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network\nsimilar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts.

An\nartificial neuron sums N weighted inputs and passes the result through a\nnon-linear transfer function. Large-scale ANNs impose very high computing\nrequirements for training and classification, leading to great interest in the\nuse of post-CMOS devices to realize them in an energy efficient manner. In this\npaper, we propose a spin-transfer-torque (STT) device based on Domain Wall\nMotion (DWM) magnetic strip that can efficiently implement a Soft-limiting\nNon-linear Neuron (SNN) operating at ultra-low supply voltage and current. In\ncontrast to previous spin-based neurons that can only realize hard-limiting\ntransfer functions, the proposed STT-SNN displays a continuous resistance\nchange with varying input current, and can therefore be employed to implement a\nsoft-limiting neuron transfer function. Soft-limiting neurons are greatly\npreferred to hard-limiting ones due to their much improved modeling capacity,\nwhich leads to higher network accuracy and lower network complexity. We also\npresent an ANN hardware design employing the proposed STT-SNNs and Memristor\nCrossbar Arrays (MCA) as synapses. The ultra-low voltage operation of the\nmagneto metallic STT-SNN enables the programmable MCA-synapses, computing\nanalog-domain weighted summation of input voltages, to also operate at\nultra-low voltage. We modeled the STT-SNN using micro-magnetic simulation and\nevaluated them using an ANN for character recognition. Comparisons with analog\nand digital CMOS neurons show that STT-SNNs can achieve more than two orders of\nmagnitude lower energy consumption.\n",

Although\nsignificant progress has been made in mathematically modelling the behaviour of\nPhysarum networks (and other biological transport networks) based on observed\nfeatures in experimental settings, their initial emergence - and in particular\ntheir long-term persistence and evolution - is still poorly understood. We\npresent a low-level, bottom-up, approach to the modelling of emergent transport\nnetworks. A population of simple particle-like agents coupled with paracrine\nchemotaxis behaviours in a dissipative environment results in the spontaneous\nemergence of persistent, complex structures. Second order emergent behaviours,\nin the form of network surface minimisation, are also observed contributing to\nthe long term evolution and dynamics of the networks. The framework is extended\nto allow data presentation and the population is used to perform a direct\n(spatial) approximation of network minimisation problems.

Here we\ndemonstrate memory and logic functionality in a monolithic three-dimensional\ncircuit by adapting recently proposed memristor-based stateful material\nimplication logic. Though such logic has been already implemented with a\nvariety of memory devices, prohibitively large device variability in the most\nprospective memristor-based circuits has limited experimental demonstrations to\nsimple gates and just a few cycles of operations.

It is well-known since the\ncreation of the KLJN concept that such a system could work in cryptography,\nbecause Alice and Bob can calculate the unknown resistance value from\nmeasurements, but the RR-KLJN system has not been addressed in prior\npublications since it was considered impractical. The reason for discussing it\nnow is the second scheme, the Random-Resistor-Random-Temperature (RRRT-) KLJN\nkey exchange, inspired by a recent paper of Vadai, Mingesz and Gingl, wherein\nsecurity was shown to be maintained at non-zero power flow. In the RRRT-KLJN\nsecure key exchange scheme, both the resistances and their temperatures are\ncontinuum random variables. We prove that the security of the RRRT-KLJN scheme\ncan prevail at non-zero power flow, and thus the physical law guaranteeing\nsecurity is not the Second Law of Thermodynamics but the\nFluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Alice and Bob know their own resistances and\ntemperatures and can calculate the resistance and temperature values at the\nother end of the communication channel from measured voltage, current and\npower-flow data in the wire.

As scalable and reliable quantum\ncomputers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the\nonly widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However,\nsimulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most\ncases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct\nsimulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit\nelimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to\nconsiderably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations. Moreover,\nour simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a\ngeneralized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is\ncalled extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental\nresults validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and\nEOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators,\ni.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.\n",

Applications span from automatic classification\nfor big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for\nbio-medical prosthesis. However, one of the major challenges of fabricating\nbio-inspired hardware is building ultra-high density networks out of complex\nprocessing units interlinked by tunable connections. Nanometer-scale devices\nexploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this\ncontext. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions are well suited for this\npurpose because of their multiple tunable functionalities. One such\nfunctionality, non-volatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in\nunconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when\nmemory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic\ndevices that could be beneficial for bio-inspired computing include tunable\nfast non-linear dynamics, controlled stochasticity, and the ability of single\ndevices to change functions in different operating conditions. Large networks\nof interacting spintronic nano-devices can have their interactions tuned to\ninduce complex dynamics such as synchronization, chaos, soliton diffusion,\nphase transitions, criticality, and convergence to multiple metastable states.\nA number of groups have recently proposed bio-inspired architectures that\ninclude one or several types of spintronic nanodevices. In this article we show\nhow spintronics can be used for bio-inspired computing. We review the different\napproaches that have been proposed, the recent advances in this direction, and\nthe challenges towards fully integrated spintronics-CMOS (Complementary metal -\noxide - semiconductor) bio-inspired hardware.\n",

The chip is designed to plug into existing\ndigital computers and be interacted with via a simple instruction set.\nAnti-Hebbian and Hebbian (AHaH) computing forms the theoretical framework from\nwhich a nature-inspired type of computing architecture is built where, unlike\nvon Neumann architectures, memory and processor are physically combined for\nsynaptic operations.

However, they fail to deliver the required efficiency for\ncertain basic tasks like image and speech recognition when compared to\nbiological systems. As such, taking cues from biological systems, novel\ncomputing paradigms are being explored for efficient hardware implementations\nof recognition/classification tasks. The basic building blocks of such\nneuromorphic systems are neurons and synapses. Towards that end, we propose a\nleaky-integrate-fire (LIF) neuron and a programmable non-volatile synapse using\ndomain wall motion induced by magneto-electric effect. Due to a strong elastic\npinning between the ferro-magnetic domain wall (FM-DW) and the underlying\nferro-electric domain wall (FE-DW), the FM-DW gets dragged by the FE-DW on\napplication of a voltage pulse. The fact that FE materials are insulators\nallows for pure voltage-driven FM-DW motion, which in turn can be used to mimic\nthe behaviors of biological spiking neurons and synapses. The voltage driven\nnature of the proposed devices allows energy-efficient operation. A detailed\ndevice to system level simulation framework based on micromagnetic simulations\nhas been developed to analyze the feasibility of the proposed neuro-synaptic\ndevices. We also demonstrate that the energy-efficient voltage-controlled\nbehavior of the proposed devices make them suitable for dynamic on-line and\nlifelong learning in spiking neural networks (SNNs).\n",

Electronic\nimplementation of such stochastic networks is currently limited to addition of\nalgorithmic noise to digital machines which is inherently inefficient; albeit\nrecent efforts to harness physical noise in devices for stochasticity have\nshown promise. To succeed in fabricating electronic neuromorphic networks we\nneed experimental evidence of devices with measurable and controllable\nstochasticity which is complemented with the development of reliable\nstatistical models of such observed stochasticity. Current research literature\nhas sparse evidence of the former and a complete lack of the latter. This\nmotivates the current article where we demonstrate a stochastic neuron using an\ninsulator-metal-transition (IMT) device, based on electrically induced\nphase-transition, in series with a tunable resistance. We show that an IMT\nneuron has dynamics similar to a piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron\nand incorporates all characteristics of a spiking neuron in the device\nphenomena. We experimentally demonstrate spontaneous stochastic spiking along\nwith electrically controllable firing probabilities using Vanadium Dioxide\n(VO$_2$) based IMT neurons which show a sigmoid-like transfer function. The\nstochastic spiking is explained by two noise sources - thermal noise and\nthreshold fluctuations, which act as precursors of bifurcation. As such, the\nIMT neuron is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a fluctuating\nboundary resulting in transfer curves that closely match experiments. As one of\nthe first comprehensive studies of a stochastic neuron hardware and its\nstatistical properties, this article would enable efficient implementation of a\nlarge class of neuro-mimetic networks and algorithms.\n",

However, the recent trend to design Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) for achieving human-like cognitive abilities poses significant\nchallenges towards the scalable design of neuromorphic systems (due to the\nincrease in computation/storage demands). Network pruning [7] is a powerful\ntechnique to remove redundant connections for designing optimally connected\n(maximally sparse) DNNs. However, such pruning techniques induce irregular\nconnections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they\nproduce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area\nand energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer - an integrated training\nframework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on\nMCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while\nforming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the\nnetwork to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done\niteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and\nmaximally clustered mapping. Without accuracy loss, TraNNsformer reduces the\narea (energy) consumption by 28% - 55% (49% - 67%) with respect to the original\nnetwork. Compared to network pruning, TraNNsformer achieves 28% - 49% (15% -\n29%) area (energy) savings. Furthermore, TraNNsformer is a technology-aware\nframework that allows mapping a given DNN to any MCA size permissible by the\nmemristive technology for reliable operations.\n",

Here we experimentally\ndemonstrate operation of one-hidden layer perceptron classifier entirely in the\nmixed-signal integrated hardware, comprised of two passive 20x20 metal-oxide\nmemristive crossbar arrays, board-integrated with discrete CMOS components. The\ndemonstrated multilayer perceptron network, whose complexity is almost 10x\nhigher as compared to previously reported functional neuromorphic classifiers\nbased on passive memristive circuits, achieves classification fidelity within 3\npercent of that obtained in simulations, when using ex-situ training approach.\nThe successful demonstration was facilitated by improvements in fabrication\ntechnology of memristors, specifically by lowering variations in their I-V\ncharacteristics.\n",

        "summary": "  To communicate at the nanoscale, researchers have proposed molecular\ncommunication as an energy-efficient solution. The drawback to this solution is\nthat the histogram of the molecules' hitting times, which constitute the\nmolecular signal at the receiver, has a heavy tail. Reducing the effects of\nthis heavy tail, inter-symbol interference (ISI), has been the focus of most\nprior research. In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a\ncounting region on the spherical receiver's surface facing towards the\ntransmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that\nthe molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be\ncoming through longer paths that contribute to ISI. In order to justify this\nidea, the joint distribution of the arrival molecules with respect to angle and\ntime is derived. Using this distribution, the channel model function is\napproximated for the proposed system, i.e., the partially counting absorbing\nspherical receiver. After validating the channel model function, the\ncharacteristics of the molecular signal are investigated and improved\nperformance is presented. Moreover, the optimal counting region in terms of bit\nerror rate is found analytically.\n",

In\nour proposed hybrid DGM architectures, HfOx based (filamentary-type switching)\nOxRAM devices are extensively used for realizing multiple computational and\nnon-computational functions such as: (i) Synapses (weights), (ii) internal\nneuron-state storage, (iii) stochastic neuron activation and (iv) programmable\nsignal normalization. To validate the proposed scheme we have simulated two\ndifferent architectures: (i) Deep Belief Network (DBN) and (ii) Stacked\nDenoising Autoencoder for classification and reconstruction of hand-written\ndigits from a reduced MNIST dataset of 6000 images. Contrastive-divergence (CD)\nspecially optimized for OxRAM devices was used to drive the synaptic weight\nupdate mechanism of each layer in the network. Overall learning rule was based\non greedy-layer wise learning with no back propagation which allows the network\nto be trained to a good pre-training stage. Performance of the simulated hybrid\nCMOS-RRAM DGM model matches closely with software based model for a 2-layers\ndeep network. Top-3 test accuracy achieved by the DBN was 95.5%. MSE of the SDA\nnetwork was 0.003, lower than software based approach. Endurance analysis of\nthe simulated architectures show that for 200 epochs of training (single RBM\nlayer), maximum switching events/per OxRAM device was ~ 7000 cycles.\n",

The paper will give an overview of\nthe neuromorphic computing platform at the KIP and the associated hardware\nrequirements which drove the described technological developments. In the first\nphase of the project standard redistribution technologies from wafer level\npackaging were adapted to enable a high density reticle-to-reticle routing on\n200mm CMOS wafers. Neighboring reticles were interconnected across the scribe\nlines with an 8{\\mu}m pitch routing based on semi-additive copper\nmetallization. Passivation by photo sensitive benzocyclobutene was used to\nenable a second intra-reticle routing layer. Final IO pads with flash gold were\ngenerated on top of each reticle. With that concept neuromorphic systems based\non full wafers could be assembled and tested. The fabricated high density\ninter-reticle routing revealed a very high yield of larger than 99.9%. In order\nto allow an upscaling of the system size to a large number of wafers with\nfeasible effort a full wafer embedding concept for printed circuit boards was\ndeveloped and proven in the second phase of the project. The wafers were\nthinned to 250{\\mu}m and laminated with additional prepreg layers and copper\nfoils into a core material. After lamination of the PCB panel the reticle IOs\nof the embedded wafer were accessed by micro via drilling, copper\nelectroplating, lithography and subtractive etching of the PCB wiring\nstructure. The created wiring with 50um line width enabled an access of the\nreticle IOs on the embedded wafer as well as a board level routing. The panels\nwith the embedded wafers were subsequently stressed with up to 1000 thermal\ncycles between 0C and 100C and have shown no severe failure formation over the\ncycle time.\n",

The measured\nchannel response with capacitive termination reduces low frequency loss and\nallows flat band transfer function down to 13 KHz, establishing the human body\nas a broadband communication channel.

Reversible logic synthesis has been widely studied due to\nits relationship with low-energy computation as well as quantum computation. In\nthis work, we give a structured decomposition for even reversible Boolean\nfunctions (RBF). Specifically, for $n\\geq 6$, any even $n$-bit RBF can be\ndecomposed to $7$ blocks of $(n-1)$-bit RBF, where $7$ is a constant\nindependent of $n$; and the positions of those blocks have large degree of\nfreedom. Moreover, if the $(n-1)$-bit RBFs are required to be even as well, we\nshow for $n\\geq 10$, $n$-bit RBF can be decomposed to $10$ even $(n-1)$-bit\nRBFs. For simplicity, we say our decomposition has block depth $7$ and even\nblock depth $10$.\n  Our result improves Selinger's work in block depth model, by reducing the\nconstant from $9$ to $7$; and from $13$ to $10$ when the blocks are limited to\nbe even. We emphasize that our setting is a bit different from Selinger's. In\nSelinger's constructive proof, each block is one of two specific positions and\nthus the decomposition has an alternating structure. We relax this restriction\nand allow each block to act on arbitrary $(n-1)$ bits. This relaxation keeps\nthe block structure and provides more candidates when choosing positions of\nblocks.\n",

The proposed calculation model is\napplied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with\npositive and negative weights are separately performed in each layer and\nsummation results are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction\noperation. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to\nimplement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current\nmode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in\ncharging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be\ndesigned without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low\npower consumption. However, they have to use very high resistance devices on\nthe order of G$\\rm \\Omega$. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS VLSI chip\nto verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights and evaluated it by\npost-layout circuit simulation using 250-nm fabrication technology. High\nresistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of\nMOS transistors. Simulation results showed that energy efficiency for the\nweighted-sum calculation was 290~TOPS/W, more than one order of magnitude\nhigher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even though the\nminimum width of interconnection used in the PoC chip was several times larger\nthan that in such digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is\nused to implement the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than\n1,000~TOPS/W will be possible.

Generally OxRAM cells consist of a transition\nmetal oxide (typically HfO2, Ta2O5, TiO2) sandwiched between two metal\nelectrodes (typically TiN, TaN, W but also Pt, Ir). This thesis describes the\nexperimental investigation performed on OxRAM memories during a 6-months\ninternship project at imec research institute (Leuven, Belgium). From previous\nstudies, HfO-based OxRAM memories showed good endurance properties (with more\nthan 10e9 write cycles), low operating current (as low as 10 uA), and very fast\nswitching (programming pulses of 100 ns). However, it has been observed that,\nunder low programming current condition, data stability becomes challenging.\nTherefore, this programming state stability needed further investigation. This\nthesis addresses the problem of state stability, first, by presenting the\nequipment and algorithms used to study OxRAM state loss over short time\nintervals. Secondly, various experiments and tests are performed searching for\na key parameter in order to control memory retention. Finally, this work\ndemonstrates that resistance evolution over time is affected by both a\ndeterminist drift (logarithmically dependent on time) and a random stochastic\nfluctuation component. It also demonstrates that this behavior is intrinsic in\nthe nature of the device itself and does not depend on processing issues or\nvariation in the programming conditions. This experimental study proved the\nintrinsic nature of the program instability phenomena in OxRAM devices, which\nin turns leads to the ineffectiveness of verify algorithm for low current\noperation.\n",

This has been mostly\nachieved at a software level, and a strong effort is currently being made to\nmimic neurons and synapses with hardware components, an approach known as\nneuromorphic computing. CMOS-based circuits have been used for this purpose,\nbut they are non-scalable, limiting the device density and motivating the\nsearch for neuromorphic materials. While recent advances in resistive switching\nhave provided a path to emulate synapses at the 10 nm scale, a scalable neuron\nanalogue is yet to be found. Here, we show how heat transfer can be utilized to\nmimic neuron functionalities in Mott nanodevices. We use the Joule heating\ncreated by current spikes to trigger the insulator-to-metal transition in a\nbiased VO2 nanogap. We show that thermal dynamics allow the implementation of\nthe basic neuron functionalities: activity, leaky integrate-and-fire,\nvolatility and rate coding. By using local temperature as the internal\nvariable, we avoid the need of external capacitors, which reduces neuristor\nsize by several orders of magnitude. This approach could enable neuromorphic\nhardware to take full advantage of the rapid advances in memristive synapses,\nallowing for much denser and complex neural networks. More generally, we show\nthat heat dissipation is not always an undesirable effect: it can perform\ncomputing tasks if properly engineered.\n",

Resistive crossbar arrays enable denser memory due to the small size\nof switching devices.

The requirements for the readout circuitry are\ndiscussed and satisfied in the proposed circuit. Additionally, an approximated\nexpression for the power consumed while reading the array is derived.

Systems capable of such behavior typically\nmake use of \"glue cooperation\" in which the glues on at least $2$ sides of a\ntile must match and bind to those exposed on the perimeter of an assembly for\nthat tile to attach. However, several models have been developed which utilize\n\"weak cooperation\", where only a single glue needs to bind but other\npreventative forces (such as geometric, or steric, hindrance) provide\nadditional selection for which tiles may attach, and where this allows for\nalgorithmic behavior. In this paper we first work in a model where tiles are\nallowed to have geometric bumps and dents on their edges. We show how such\ntiles can simulate systems of square tiles with complex glue functions (using\nasymptotically optimal sizes of bumps and dents), and also how they can\nsimulate weakly cooperative systems in a model which allows for duples (i.e.\ntiles either twice as long or twice as tall as square tiles).

Typically a\nreservoir computer is constructed by connecting a large number of nonlinear\nnodes in a network, driving the nodes with an input signal and using the node\noutputs to fit a training signal. In this work, we set up reservoirs where the\nedges (or connections) between all the network nodes are either +1 or 0, and\nproceed to alter the network structure by flipping some of these edges from +1\nto -1. We use this simple network because it turns out to be easy to\ncharacterize; we may use the fraction of edges flipped as a measure of how much\nwe have altered the network. In some cases, the network can be rearranged in a\nfinite number of ways without changing its structure; these rearrangements are\nsymmetries of the network, and the number of symmetries is also useful for\ncharacterizing the network.

Existing approaches optimize the camera and\ncommunication modules individually to minimize their power consumption.\nHowever, the joint redesign and optimization of wireless communication as well\nas the camera is what that provides more power saving. We present an\nultra-low-power wireless video streaming camera. To achieve this, we present a\nnovel \"analog\" video backscatter technique that feeds analog pixels from the\nphoto-diodes directly to the backscatter hardware, thereby eliminating power\nconsuming hardware components such as ADCs and amplifiers. We prototype our\nwireless camera using off-the-shelf hardware and show that our design can\nstream video at up to 13 FPS and can operate up to a distance of 150 feet from\nthe access point. Our COTS prototype consumes 2.36mW. Finally, to demonstrate\nthe potential of our design, we built two proof-of-concept applications: video\nstreaming for micro-robots and security cameras for face detection.\n",

        "summary": "  Reversible logic has attracted much research interest over the last few\ndecades, especially due to its application in quantum computing. In the\nconstruction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly\nused to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic\ngates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and\nFredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be\nexpensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla\nbits a practical topic.\n  This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single\nbase gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of\nthe 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three\nmain results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can\ngenerate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated\nToffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations\nusing no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative\nreversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known\nresult for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known\nresult for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is\ntrivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove\ntheir optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible\ngates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We\nalso explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new\nconcept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an\nunlimited number of borrowed bits.\n",

The ELM\nsecond stage consisting of just adders can be implemented as digital circuit\nwith estimated power consumption of $20.9$ nJ/classify. With a total energy\nconsumption of only $5.97$ $\\mu$J/classify, this low-power mixed signal ASIC\ncan act as a co-processor in portable electronic gadgets with cameras.\n",

Here, ADMM helps in splitting a complex optimization\nproblem into subproblems that involve the solution of systems of linear\nequations. The capability of this framework is shown by applying it to linear\nprogramming, quadratic programming, and sparse optimization. In addition to\nADMM, implementation of a customized power iteration (PI) method for\neigenvalue/eigenvector computation using memristor crossbars is discussed. The\nmemristor-based PI method can further be applied to principal component\nanalysis (PCA).

However, conventional\nfabrication methods are infeasible for M3D-enabled designs due to temperature\nrelated issues. This has necessitated lower temperature and\ntemperature-resilient techniques for M3D fabrication, leading to inferior\nperformance of transistors in the top tier and interconnects in the bottom\ntier. The resulting inter-tier process variation leads to performance\ndegradation of M3D-enabled NoCs. In this work, we demonstrate that without\nconsidering inter-tier process variation, an M3D-enabled NoC architecture\noverestimates the energy-delay-product (EDP) on average by 50.8% for a set of\nSPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks. As a countermeasure, we adopt a process\nvariation aware design approach.

Finally, we propose a simple\nmodification of the implemented memristor-based vector-by-matrix multiplier to\nallow its operation in a wider temperature range.\n",

This leads the author to the erroneous conclusion\nthat charge-voltage curves of any memcapacitive devices should be pinched at\nthe origin. The purpose of this Comment is to correct the wrong statements in\nChua's paper, as well as to highlight some other inconsistencies in his\nreasoning. We also provide experimental evidence of a memcapacitive device\nshowing non-pinched hysteresis.\n",

We find both similarities with and\nmajor differences from the related properties of quantum systems. Two search\nalgorithms utilizing the observed features are introduced. For the first one we\nassume an unsorted names database set up by Alice that is a superposition\n(unknown by Bob) of up to n=2^N strings; those we call names. Bob has access to\nthe superposition wave and to the 2N reference noises of the INBL system of N\nnoise bits. For Bob, to decide if a given name x is included in the\nsuperposition, once the search has begun, it takes N switching operations\nfollowed by a single measurement of the superposition wave. Thus the time and\nhardware complexity of the search algorithm is O[log(n)] which indicates an\nexponential speedup compared to Grover's quantum algorithm in a corresponding\nsetting. An extra advantage is that the error probability of the search is\nzero. Moreover, the scheme can also check the existence of a fraction of a\nstring, or several separate string fractions embedded in an arbitrarily long,\narbitrary string. In the second algorithm, we expand the above scheme to a\nphonebook with n names and s phone numbers. When the names and numbers have the\nsame bit resolution, once the search has begun, the time and hardware\ncomplexity of this search algorithm is O[log(n)]. In the case of one-to-one\ncorrespondence between names and phone numbers (n=s), the algorithm offers\ninverse phonebook search too. The error probability of this search algorithm is\nalso zero.\n",

By introducing a two-fold\ntraining procedure (i.e., ex-situ pre-training and in-situ re-training) and\nseveral training techniques, the number of weight updates can be significantly\nreduced and thus it will be suitable for efficient in-situ learning\nimplementations. As a case study, we consider the task of balancing an inverted\npendulum, a classical problem in both RL and control theory. We believe that\nthis study shows the promise of using memristor-based hardware neural networks\nfor handling complex tasks through in-situ reinforcement learning.\n",

Such a device,\nbesides exhibiting spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP), needs to be highly\nscalable, have a large endurance and require low energy for transitioning\nbetween states. In this work, we first introduce and empirically determine two\nnew specifications for an synapse in SNNs: number of conductance levels per\nsynapse and maximum learning-rate. To the best of our knowledge, there are no\nRRAMs that meet the latter specification. As a solution, we propose the use of\nmultiple PCMO-RRAMs in parallel within a synapse. While synaptic reading, all\nPCMO-RRAMs are simultaneously read and for each synaptic conductance-change\nevent, the mechanism for conductance STDP is initiated for only one RRAM,\nrandomly picked from the set. Second, to validate our solution, we\nexperimentally demonstrate STDP of conductance of a PCMO-RRAM and then show\nthat due to a large learning-rate, a single PCMO-RRAM fails to model a synapse\nin the training of an SNN. As anticipated, network training improves as more\nPCMO-RRAMs are added to the synapse. Fourth, we discuss the\ncircuit-requirements for implementing such a scheme, to conclude that the\nrequirements are within bounds. Thus, our work presents specifications for\nsynaptic devices in trainable SNNs, indicates the shortcomings of state-of-art\nsynaptic contenders, and provides a solution to extrinsically meet the\nspecifications and discusses the peripheral circuitry that implements the\nsolution.\n",

In this paper, using the well-known\nMUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, we study DOA estimation for\nNWSNs for different energy levels, distances, pulse shapes, and frequencies.\nOur analyses reveal that the best DOA estimation is achieved with the first\norder Gaussian pulses, which emit their peak energy at 6 THz.

Due to its computational efficiency and the\nfact that training amounts to a simple linear regression, both spiking and\nnon-spiking implementations of reservoir computing on neuromorphic hardware\nhave been developed. Here, a review of these experimental studies is provided\nto illustrate the progress in this area and to address the technical challenges\nwhich arise from this specific hardware implementation. Moreover, to deal with\nchallenges of computation on such unconventional substrates, several lines of\npotential solutions are presented based on advances in other computational\napproaches in machine learning.

Resistive devices can address the density and volatility issues,\nbut have been limited by peripheral circuit integration. In this work, we\ndemonstrate a scalable RRAM based in-memory computing design, termed XNOR-RRAM,\nwhich is fabricated in a 90nm CMOS technology with monolithic integration of\nRRAM devices between metal 1 and 2. We integrated a 128x64 RRAM array with CMOS\nperipheral circuits including row/column decoders and flash analog-to-digital\nconverters (ADCs), which collectively become a core component for scalable\nRRAM-based in-memory computing towards large deep neural networks (DNNs). To\nmaximize the parallelism of in-memory computing, we assert all 128 wordlines of\nthe RRAM array simultaneously, perform analog computing along the bitlines, and\ndigitize the bitline voltages using ADCs. The resistance distribution of low\nresistance states is tightened by write-verify scheme, and the ADC offset is\ncalibrated. Prototype chip measurements show that the proposed design achieves\nhigh binary DNN accuracy of 98.5% for MNIST and 83.5% for CIFAR-10 datasets,\nrespectively, with energy efficiency of 24 TOPS/W and 158 GOPS throughput.

If the charge pump is\nactivated too frequently, its internal CMOS devices do not recover from stress,\naccelerating their aging and leading to negative bias temperature instability\n(NBTI) generated defects.

The state-of-the-art mapping\ntechnique is based on a heuristic that only guarantees to produce the correct\noutput for two input vectors. In this paper, a technique that aims to produce\nthe correct output for every input vector is proposed, which involves\nspecifying the memristor conductance values and a scaling factor realized by\nthe peripheral circuitry. The key insight of the paper is that the conductance\nmatrix realized by an MCA is only required to be proportional to the target\nmatrix. The selection of the scaling factor between the two regulates the\nutilization of the programmable memristor conductance range and the\nrepresentability of the target matrix. Consequently, the scaling factor is set\nto balance precision and value range errors. Moreover, a technique of\nconverting conductance values into state variables and vice versa is proposed\nto handle memristors with non-ideal device characteristics.

The\nattention, has therefore, shifted from homogeneous computing to specialized\nheterogeneous solutions. As an example, brain-inspired computing has re-emerged\nas a viable solution for many applications. Such new processors, however, have\nwidened the abstraction gamut from device level to applications. Therefore,\nefficient abstractions that can provide vertical design-flow tools for such\ntechnologies became critical. Photonics in general, and neuromorphic photonics\nin particular, are among the promising alternatives to electronics. While the\narsenal of device level toolbox for photonics, and high-level neural network\nplatforms are rapidly expanding, there has not been much work to bridge this\ngap. Here, we present a design methodology to mitigate this problem by\nextending high-level hardware-agnostic neural network design tools with\nfunctional and performance models of photonic components.

        "summary": "  Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems.\nHowever, it cannot overcome qubit limitation for large-scale problems.\nFurthermore, the execution time of QAOA scales exponentially with the problem\nsize. We propose a Divide-and-Conquer QAOA (DC-QAOA) to address the above\nchallenges for graph maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. The algorithm works by\nrecursively partitioning a larger graph into smaller ones whose MaxCut\nsolutions are obtained with small-size NISQ computers. The overall solution is\nretrieved from the sub-solutions by applying the combination policy of quantum\nstate reconstruction. Multiple partitioning and reconstruction methods are\nproposed/ compared. DC-QAOA achieves 97.14% approximation ratio (20.32% higher\nthan classical counterpart), and 94.79% expectation value (15.80% higher than\nquantum annealing). DC-QAOA also reduces the time complexity of conventional\nQAOA from exponential to quadratic.\n",

A major obstacle to scaling up these systems is static\nfabrication error, where small component errors within each device accrue to\nproduce significant errors within the circuit computation. Mitigating this\nerror usually requires numerical optimization dependent on real-time feedback\nfrom the circuit, which can greatly limit the scalability of the hardware. Here\nwe present a deterministic approach to correcting circuit errors by locally\ncorrecting hardware errors within individual optical gates. We apply our\napproach to simulations of large scale optical neural networks and infinite\nimpulse response filters implemented in programmable photonics, finding that\nthey remain resilient to component error well beyond modern day process\ntolerances.

Given\nthat it is unrealistic to expect existing quantum systems to provide, in near\nfuture, sufficient number of qubits that can accommodate large circuit, there\nis a pressing need to explore strategies that can somehow execute large\ncircuits on small systems. In this paper, first, we perform an analysis to\nidentify the qubits that are most suitable for circuit resizing. Our results\nreveal that, in most quantum programs, there exist qubits that can be reused\nmid-program to serially/sequentially execute the circuit employing fewer\nqubits. Motivated by this observation, we design, implement and evaluate a\ncompiler-based approach that i) identifies the qubits that can be most\nbeneficial for serial circuit execution; ii) selects those qubits to reuse at\neach step of execution for size minimization of the circuit; and iii) minimizes\nMiddle Measurement (MM) delays due to impractical implementation of shots to\nimprove the circuit reliability. Furthermore, since our approach intends to\nexecute the circuits sequentially, the crosstalk errors can also be optimized\nas a result of the reduced number of concurrent gates. The experimental results\nindicate that our proposed approach can (i) execute large circuits that\ninitially cannot fit into small circuits, on small quantum hardware, and (ii)\ncan significantly improve the PST of the results by 2.1X when both original and\nour serialized programs can fit into the target quantum hardware.\n",

        "summary": "  Quantum logic decomposition refers to decomposing a given quantum gate to a\nset of physically implementable gates. An approach has been presented to\ndecompose arbitrary diagonal quantum gates to a set of multiplexed-rotation\ngates around z axis. In this paper, a special class of diagonal quantum gates,\nnamely diagonal Hermitian quantum gates, is considered and a new perspective to\nthe decomposition problem with respect to decomposing these gates is presented.\nIt is first shown that these gates can be decomposed to a set that solely\nconsists of multiple-controlled Z gates. Then a binary representation for the\ndiagonal Hermitian gates is introduced. It is shown that the binary\nrepresentations of multiple-controlled Z gates form a basis for the vector\nspace that is produced by the binary representations of all diagonal Hermitian\nquantum gates. Moreover, the problem of decomposing a given diagonal Hermitian\ngate is mapped to the problem of writing its binary representation in the\nspecific basis mentioned above. Moreover, CZ gate is suggested to be the\ntwo-qubit gate in the decomposition library, instead of previously used CNOT\ngate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can lead to circuits\nwith lower costs in comparison with the previous ones.\n",

We model actin filament as a double chain of finite\nstate machines, nodes, which take states `0' and `1'. The states are\nabstractions of absence and presence of a sub-threshold charge on an actin\nunits corresponding to the nodes. All nodes update their state in parallel in\ndiscrete time. A node updates its current state depending on states of two\nclosest neighbours in the node chain and two closest neighbours in the\ncomplementary chain. Previous models of actin automata considered momentary\nstate transitions of nodes. We enrich the actin automata model by assuming that\nstates of nodes depends not only on the current states of neighbouring node but\nalso on their past states. Thus, we assess the effect of memory of past states\non the dynamics of acting automata. We demonstrate in computational experiments\nthat memory slows down propagation of perturbations, decrease entropy of\nspace-time patterns generated, transforms travelling localisations to\nstationary oscillators, and stationary oscillations to still patterns.\n",

However, there\nare limitations and challenges with the current technologies. Firstly, the\nstimulation of neurons currently is possible through implantable electrodes but\nlimited to a population of neurons. Secondly, a major hurdle lies in developing\nminiature devices that can last for a lifetime in the patient's brain. In\nparallel, Optogenetics has emerged proposing the stimulation of neurons using\nlight by means of optical fibers inserted through the skull. Many challenges\nare thus introduced in terms of suitability to patient's lifestyle and\nbiocompatibility. We have recently proposed the concept of wireless optogenetic\nnanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment\nproblems, and at the same time targeting single neuron stimulation [1]. The\nWiOptND is equipped with a miniature LED that is able to stimulate a\ngenetically engineered neuron while harvesting energy from ultrasonic\nvibrations. This paper investigates how light propagates in the brain tissue,\nand based on the power required to emit sufficient intensity for stimulation,\nan energy harvesting circuitry is designed. A number of charging protocols are\nalso proposed to maximize energy efficiency while ensuring minimum number of\nneural spike misfirings. These protocols include the Charge and Fire, the\nPredictive Sliding Detection Window, and its variant Markov-Chain based\nTime-Delay Patterns. Simulation results show the drop of stimulation ratio for\n25% and more stable trend in its efficiency ratio are exhibited on Markov-Chain\nbased Time-Delay Patterns compared to Change and Fire. The results show the\nfeasibility of utilizing WiOptND for long-term implants, and a new direction\ntowards precise stimulation of neurons in the cortical columns of the brain.\n",

Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the\ncompiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which\nintroduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the\nalgorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high\ncomplexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and\ncontrollability.\n  To address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based\nBidiREctional heuristic search algorithm SABRE, which is applicable to NISQ\ndevices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search\nattempt,globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal\ntechnique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the\ndepth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the\nbest known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results\non various benchmarks.\n",

We show that low barrier magnets or LBM's provide a natural physical\nrepresentation for p-bits and can be built either from perpendicular magnets\n(PMA) designed to be close to the in-plane transition or from circular in-plane\nmagnets (IMA). Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) built using LBM's as free layers\ncan be combined with standard NMOS transistors to provide three-terminal\nbuilding blocks for large scale probabilistic circuits that can be designed to\nperform useful functions. Interestingly, this three-terminal unit looks just\nlike the 1T/MTJ device used in embedded MRAM technology, with only one\ndifference: the use of an LBM for the MTJ free layer. We hope that the concept\nof p-bits and p-circuits will help open up new application spaces for this\nemerging technology. However, a p-bit need not involve an MTJ, any fluctuating\nresistor could be combined with a transistor to implement it, while completely\ndigital implementations using conventional CMOS technology are also possible.\nThe p-bit also provides a conceptual bridge between two active but disjoint\nfields of research, namely stochastic machine learning and quantum computing.\nFirst, there are the applications that are based on the similarity of a p-bit\nto the binary stochastic neuron (BSN), a well-known concept in machine\nlearning. Three-terminal p-bits could provide an efficient hardware accelerator\nfor the BSN. Second, there are the applications that are based on the p-bit\nbeing like a poor man's q-bit. Initial demonstrations based on full SPICE\nsimulations show that several optimization problems including quantum annealing\nare amenable to p-bit implementations which can be scaled up at room\ntemperature using existing technology.\n",

A charge current sent through a polarizer ferromagnet\n(P-FM) nucleates a skyrmion at the input end of an intra-gate FM interconnect\nwith perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA-FM). The output end of the PMA--FM\nforms the free layer of an MTJ stack. A spin Hall metal (SHM) is placed beneath\nthe PMA-FM. The skyrmion is propagated to the output end of the PMA-FM by\npassing a charge current through the SHM. The resistance of the MTJ stack is\nlow (high) when a skyrmion is present (absent) in the free layer, thereby\nrealizing an inverter. A framework is developed to analyze the performance of\nthe SkyLogic device. A circuit-level technique is developed that counters the\ntransverse displacement of skyrmion in the PMA-FM and allows use of high\ncurrent densities for fast propagation. The design space exploration of the\nPMA-FM material parameters is performed to obtain an optimal design point. At\nthe optimal point, we obtain an inverter delay of 434 ps with a switching\nenergy of 7.1 fJ.\n",

However, the high efficiency and high density advantages of ReRAM have\nnot been fully utilized due to the huge communication demands among PEs and the\noverhead of peripheral circuits.\n  In this paper, we propose a full system stack solution, composed of a\nreconfigurable architecture design, Field Programmable Synapse Array (FPSA) and\nits software system including neural synthesizer, temporal-to-spatial mapper,\nand placement & routing. We highly leverage the software system to make the\nhardware design compact and efficient. To satisfy the high-performance\ncommunication demand, we optimize it with a reconfigurable routing architecture\nand the placement & routing tool. To improve the computational density, we\ngreatly simplify the PE circuit with the spiking schema and then adopt neural\nsynthesizer to enable the high density computation-resources to support\ndifferent kinds of NN operations. In addition, we provide spiking memory blocks\n(SMBs) and configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in hardware and leverage the\ntemporal-to-spatial mapper to utilize them to balance the storage and\ncomputation requirements of NN. Owing to the end-to-end software system, we can\nefficiently deploy existing deep neural networks to FPSA. Evaluations show\nthat, compared to one of state-of-the-art ReRAM-based NN accelerators, PRIME,\nthe computational density of FPSA improves by 31x; for representative NNs, its\ninference performance can achieve up to 1000x speedup.\n",

        "summary": "  We review the physical foundations of Landauer's Principle, which relates the\nloss of information from a computational process to an increase in\nthermodynamic entropy. Despite the long history of the Principle, its\nfundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently\nmisunderstood. Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere\ntransfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can\noccur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.\nHowever, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,\nit more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated\ninformation from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an\nuncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.\nAny uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize\nthe physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as\nobservers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates\nof such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is\nejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from\nour perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total\nentropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational\ninformation motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the\nrequirements for computations to be thermodynamically reversible are less\nrestrictive than frequently described, particularly in the case of stochastic\ncomputational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the design of\ncomputational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational\noperations while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be\nfully explored.\n",

Here we focus on function computation\nwith CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the\ninput and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output.\nSpecifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the\ncomputation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and\ncomposable ($f\\circ g$ can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$\nand $g$). Rate independence and composability are important engineering\ndesiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or\neven \"well-mixedness\", and allowing the systematic construction of complex\ncomputation via modular design. We show that to construct composable\nrate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output\nspecies of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We\nthen exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as\nsuperadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear.

        "summary": "  Approximating kernel functions with random features (RFs)has been a\nsuccessful application of random projections for nonparametric estimation.\nHowever, performing random projections presents computational challenges for\nlarge-scale problems. Recently, a new optical hardware called Optical\nProcessing Unit (OPU) has been developed for fast and energy-efficient\ncomputation of large-scale RFs in the analog domain. More specifically, the OPU\nperforms the multiplication of input vectors by a large random matrix with\ncomplex-valued i.i.d. Gaussian entries, followed by the application of an\nelement-wise squared absolute value operation - this last nonlinearity being\nintrinsic to the sensing process. In this paper, we show that this operation\nresults in a dot-product kernel that has connections to the polynomial kernel,\nand we extend this computation to arbitrary powers of the feature map.\nExperiments demonstrate that the OPU kernel and its RF approximation achieve\ncompetitive performance in applications using kernel ridge regression and\ntransfer learning for image classification. Crucially, thanks to the use of the\nOPU, these results are obtained with time and energy savings.\n",

        "summary": "  Recent Brain-Machine Interfaces have shifted towards miniature devices that\nare constructed from nanoscale components. While these devices can be implanted\ninto the brain, their functionalities can be limited, and will require\ncommunication and networking to enable cooperation. One form of communication\nfor neuron stimulation is the use of light. A number of considerations needs to\nbe taken into account for the propagation and this includes diffraction,\nscattering, absorption, as well as attenuation. These properties are not only\naffected by the medium, but also by the cell's geometric shape. These factor\naffects both the direction and amplitude of the light wave. This paper analyzes\nthe propagation path loss and geometrical gain, channel impulse and frequency\nresponse for light propagation along the neural tissue. The total attenuation\ndepends on the propagation medium loss and geometrical gain, and the channel\nresponse is highly dependent on the quantity of cells along the path.\nAdditionally, the optical properties of the medium also impacts on the time\ndelay at the receiver and the width the location of the detectors. Based on the\nnumerical analysis, spherical cells attenuate approximately 20% of the\ntransmitted power, which is less than the fusiform and pyramidal cells (35% and\n65%, respectively).\n",

These\narchitectures are ideal for dense layers with fewer than roughly a thousand\nneurons. However, for large sparse layers, crossbar architectures are highly\ninefficient. A new hardware architecture, dubbed the MN3 (Memristive Nanowire\nNeural Network), was recently described as an efficient architecture for\nsimulating very wide, sparse neural network layers, on the order of millions of\nneurons per layer. The MN3 utilizes a high-density memristive nanowire mesh to\nefficiently connect large numbers of silicon neurons with modifiable weights.\nHere, in order to explore the MN3's ability to function as a deep neural\nnetwork, we describe one algorithm for training deep MN3 models and benchmark\nsimulations of the architecture on two deep learning tasks. We utilize a simple\npiecewise linear memristor model, since we seek to demonstrate that training\nis, in principle, possible for randomized nanowire architectures. In future\nwork, we intend on utilizing more realistic memristor models, and we will adapt\nthe presented algorithm appropriately. We show that the MN3 is capable of\nperforming composition, gradient propagation, and weight updates, which\ntogether allow it to function as a deep neural network. We show that a\nsimulated multilayer perceptron (MLP), built from MN3 networks, can obtain a\n1.61% error rate on the popular MNIST dataset, comparable to equivalently sized\nsoftware-based network. This work represents, to the authors' knowledge, the\nfirst randomized nanowire architecture capable of reproducing the\nbackpropagation algorithm.\n",

Therefore, the accurate modeling of the corresponding MC channel is of\nhigh importance. The propagation of particles in these systems is caused by a\ncombination of diffusion and flow with a parabolic velocity profile, i.e.,\nlaminar flow. The propagation characteristics of the particles can be\ncategorized into three different regimes: The flow dominant regime where the\ninfluence of diffusion on the particle transport is negligible, the dispersive\nregime where diffusion has a much stronger impact than flow, and the mixed\nregime where both effects are important. For the limiting regimes, i.e., the\nflow dominant and dispersive regimes, there are well-known solutions and\napproximations for particle transport. In contrast, there is no general\nanalytical solution for the mixed regime, and instead, approximations,\nnumerical techniques, and particle based simulations have been employed. In\nthis paper, we develop a general model for the advection-diffusion problem in\ncylindrical environments which provides an analytical solution applicable in\nall regimes. The modeling procedure is based on a transfer function approach\nand the main focus lies on the incorporation of laminar flow into the\nanalytical model. The properties of the proposed model are analyzed by\nnumerical evaluation for different scenarios including the uniform and point\nrelease of particles. We provide a comparison with particle based simulations\nand the well-known solutions for the limiting regimes to demonstrate the\nvalidity of the proposed analytical model.\n",

This requires decomposition of complex quantum\ngates into a cascade of simple one qubit and two qubit gates. The\nmethodological framework for physical synthesis imposes a constraint regarding\nplacement of operands (qubits) and operators. If physical qubits can be placed\non a grid, where each node of the grid represents a qubit then quantum gates\ncan only be operated on adjacent qubits, otherwise SWAP gates must be inserted\nto convert non-Linear Nearest Neighbor architecture to Linear Nearest Neighbor\narchitecture. Insertion of SWAP gates should be made optimal to reduce\ncumulative cost of physical implementation. A schedule layout generation is\nrequired for placement and routing apriori to actual implementation. In this\npaper, two algorithms are proposed to optimize the number of SWAP gates in any\narbitrary quantum circuit. The first algorithm is intended to start with\ngeneration of an interaction graph followed by finding the longest path\nstarting from the node with maximum degree. The second algorithm optimizes the\nnumber of SWAP gates between any pair of non-neighbouring qubits.

To extend DNN's superior inference\ncapabilities to energy constrained devices, architectures and circuits that\nminimize energy-per-MAC must be developed. In this respect, analog delay-based\nMAC is advantageous due to reasons both extrinsic and intrinsic to the MAC\nimplementation - (1) lower fixed-point precision requirement for a DNN's\nevaluation, (2) better dynamic range than charge-based accumulation, for\nsmaller technology nodes, and (3) simpler analog-digital interfacing.\nImplementing DNNs using delay-based MAC requires mixed-signal delay multipliers\nthat accept digitally stored weights and analog voltages as arguments. To this\nend, a novel, linearly tune-able delay-cell is proposed, wherein, the delay is\nrealized using an inverted MOS capacitor's (C*) steady discharge from a\nlinearly input-voltage dependent initial charge. The cell is analytically\nmodeled, constraints for its functional validity are determined, and\njitter-models are developed. Multiple cells with scaled delays, corresponding\nto each bit of the digital argument, must be cascaded to form the multiplier.\nTo realize such bit-wise delay-scaling of the cells, a biasing circuit is\nproposed that generates sub-threshold gate-voltages to scale C*'s discharging\nrate, and thus area-expensive transistor width-scaling is avoided. For 130nm\nCMOS technology, the theoretical constraints and limits on jitter are used to\nfind the optimal design-point and quantify the jitter versus\nbits-per-multiplier trade-off. Schematic-level simulations show a worst-case\nenergy-consumption close to the state-of-art, and thus, feasibility of the\ncell.\n",

A common theme of\nsuch Ising Machines is to tailor the physics of underlying hardware to the\nmathematics of the Ising model to improve some aspect of performance that is\nmeasured in speed to solution, energy consumption per solution or area\nfootprint of the adopted hardware. One such approach to build an Ising spin, or\na binary stochastic neuron (BSN), is a compact mixed-signal unit based on a\nlow-barrier nanomagnet based design that uses a single magnetic tunnel junction\n(MTJ) and three transistors (3T-1MTJ) where the MTJ functions as a stochastic\nresistor (1SR). Such a compact unit can drastically reduce the area footprint\nof BSNs while promising massive scalability by leveraging the existing Magnetic\nRAM (MRAM) technology that has integrated 1T-1MTJ cells in ~Gbit densities. The\n3T-1SR design however can be realized using different materials or devices that\nprovide naturally fluctuating resistances. Extending previous work, we evaluate\nhardware BSNs from this general perspective by classifying necessary and\nsufficient conditions to design a fast and energy-efficient BSN that can be\nused in scaled Ising Machine implementations. We connect our device analysis to\nsystems-level metrics by emphasizing hardware-independent figures-of-merit such\nas flips per second and dissipated energy per random bit that can be used to\nclassify any Ising Machine.\n",

These achievements are the\nculmination of decades-long research into better training techniques and deeper\nneural network models, as well as improvements in hardware platforms that are\nused to train and execute the deep neural network models. Many\napplication-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware accelerators for deep\nlearning have garnered interest in recent years due to their improved\nperformance and energy-efficiency over conventional CPU and GPU architectures.\nHowever, these accelerators are constrained by fundamental bottlenecks due to\n1) the slowdown in CMOS scaling, which has limited computational and\nperformance-per-watt capabilities of emerging electronic processors, and 2) the\nuse of metallic interconnects for data movement, which do not scale well and\nare a major cause of bandwidth, latency, and energy inefficiencies in almost\nevery contemporary processor. Silicon photonics has emerged as a promising\nCMOS-compatible alternative to realize a new generation of deep learning\naccelerators that can use light for both communication and computation. This\narticle surveys the landscape of silicon photonics to accelerate deep learning,\nwith a coverage of developments across design abstractions in a bottom-up\nmanner, to convey both the capabilities and limitations of the silicon\nphotonics paradigm in the context of deep learning acceleration.\n",

        "summary": "  The main memory access latency has not much improved for more than two\ndecades while the CPU performance had been exponentially increasing until\nrecently. Approximate memory is a technique to reduce the DRAM access latency\nin return of losing data integrity. It is beneficial for applications that are\nrobust to noisy input and intermediate data such as artificial intelligence,\nmultimedia processing, and graph processing. To obtain reasonable outputs from\napplications on approximate memory, it is crucial to protect critical data\nwhile accelerating accesses to non-critical data. We refer the minimum size of\na continuous memory region that the same error rate is applied in approximate\nmemory to as the approximation granularity. A fundamental limitation of\napproximate memory is that the approximation granularity is as large as a few\nkilo bytes. However, applications may have critical and non-critical data\ninterleaved with smaller granularity. For example, a data structure for graph\nnodes can have pointers (critical) to neighboring nodes and its score\n(non-critical, depending on the use-case). This data structure cannot be\ndirectly mapped to approximate memory due to the gap between the approximation\ngranularity and the granularity of data criticality. We refer to this issue as\nthe granularity gap problem. In this paper, we first show that many\napplications potentially suffer from this problem. Then we propose a framework\nto quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead of a possible method to\navoid this problem using known techniques. The evaluation results show that the\nperformance overhead is non-negligible compared to expected benefit from\napproximate memory, suggesting that the granularity gap problem is a\nsignificant concern.\n",

This investigation is essentially important since\nthe input information is not only conveyed but also transformed by the spin\nwaves into high-dimensional information space when the waves propagate in the\nfilm in a spatially distributed manner. This spatiotemporal dynamics realizes a\nrich reservoir-computational functionality. First, we simulate spin waves in a\nrectangular garnet film with two input electrodes to obtain spatial\ndistributions of the reservoir states in response to input signals, which are\nrepresented as spin vectors and used for a machine-learning waveform\nclassification task. The detected reservoir states are combined through readout\nconnection weights to generate a final output. We visualize the spatial\ndistribution of the weights after training to discuss the number and positions\nof the output electrodes by arranging them at grid points, equiangularly\ncircular points or at random. We evaluate the classification accuracy by\nchanging the number of the output electrodes, and find that a high accuracy\n($>$ 90\\%) is achieved with only several tens of output electrodes regardless\nof grid, circular or random arrangement. These results suggest that the spin\nwaves possess sufficiently complex and rich dynamics for this type of tasks.\nThen we investigate in which area useful information is distributed more by\narranging the electrodes locally on the chip. Finally, we show that this device\nhas generalization ability for input wave-signal frequency in a certain\nfrequency range. These results will lead to practical design of spin-wave\nreservoir devices for low-power intelligent computing in the near future.\n",

These modifications consist of an extension to 3D, the\nability of tiles to form \"flexible\" bonds that allow bound tiles to rotate\nrelative to each other, and allowing tiles of multiple shapes within the same\nsystem. We call this new model the STAM*, and we present a series of\nconstructions within it that are capable of self-replicating behavior. Namely,\nthe input seed assemblies to our STAM* systems can encode either \"genomes\"\nspecifying the instructions for building a target shape, or can be copies of\nthe target shape with instructions built in. A universal tile set exists for\nany target shape (at scale factor 2), and from a genome assembly creates\ninfinite copies of the genome as well as the target shape. An input target\nstructure, on the other hand, can be \"deconstructed\" by the universal tile set\nto form a genome encoding it, which will then replicate and also initiate the\ngrowth of copies of assemblies of the target shape. Since the lengths of the\ngenomes for these constructions are proportional to the number of points in the\ntarget shape, we also present a replicator which utilizes hierarchical\nself-assembly to greatly reduce the size of the genomes required.

        "summary": "  Optical implementations of neural networks (ONNs) herald the next-generation\nhigh-speed and energy-efficient deep learning computing by harnessing the\ntechnical advantages of large bandwidth and high parallelism of optics.\nHowever, due to the problems of incomplete numerical domain, limited hardware\nscale, or inadequate numerical accuracy, the majority of existing ONNs were\nstudied for basic classification tasks. Given that regression is a fundamental\nform of deep learning and accounts for a large part of current artificial\nintelligence applications, it is necessary to master deep learning regression\nfor further development and deployment of ONNs. Here, we demonstrate a\nsilicon-based optical coherent dot-product chip (OCDC) capable of completing\ndeep learning regression tasks. The OCDC adopts optical fields to carry out\noperations in complete real-value domain instead of in only positive domain.\nVia reusing, a single chip conducts matrix multiplications and convolutions in\nneural networks of any complexity. Also, hardware deviations are compensated\nvia in-situ backpropagation control provided the simplicity of chip\narchitecture. Therefore, the OCDC meets the requirements for sophisticated\nregression tasks and we successfully demonstrate a representative neural\nnetwork, the AUTOMAP (a cutting-edge neural network model for image\nreconstruction). The quality of reconstructed images by the OCDC and a 32-bit\ndigital computer is comparable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no\nprecedent of performing such state-of-the-art regression tasks on ONN chip. It\nis anticipated that the OCDC can promote novel accomplishment of ONNs in modern\nAI applications including autonomous driving, natural language processing, and\nscientific study.\n",

Advances in photonic integrated circuits have enabled\nresearch in photonic computation, where, despite excellent features such as\nfast linear computation, no integrated photonic deep network has been\ndemonstrated to date due to the lack of scalable nonlinear functionality and\nthe loss of photonic devices, making scalability to a large number of layers\nchallenging. Here we report the first integrated end-to-end photonic deep\nneural network (PDNN) that performs instantaneous image classification through\ndirect processing of optical waves. Images are formed on the input pixels and\noptical waves are coupled into nanophotonic waveguides and processed as the\nlight propagates through layers of neurons on-chip. Each neuron generates an\noptical output from input optical signals, where linear computation is\nperformed optically and the nonlinear activation function is realised\nopto-electronically. The output of a laser coupled into the chip is uniformly\ndistributed among all neurons within the network providing the same per-neuron\nsupply light. Thus, all neurons have the same optical output range enabling\nscalability to deep networks with large number of layers. The PDNN chip is used\nfor 2- and 4-class classification of handwritten letters achieving accuracies\nof higher than 93.7% and 90.3%, respectively, with a computation time less than\none clock cycle of state-of-the-art digital computation platforms.

In-memory computing implementations of HDC are\ndesirable since they can significantly reduce data transfer overheads. All\nexisting in-memory HDC platforms consider binary HVs where each dimension is\nrepresented with a single bit.

        "summary": "  Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is an energy-efficient\nsuperconductor logic family. The latency of AQFP circuits is relatively long\ncompared to that of other superconductor logic families and thus such circuits\nrequire low-latency clocking schemes. In a previous study, we proposed a\nlow-latency clocking scheme called delay-line clocking, in which the latency\nfor each logic operation is determined by the propagation delay of the\nexcitation current, and demonstrated a simple AQFP buffer chain that adopts\ndelay-line clocking. However, it is unclear whether more complex AQFP circuits\ncan adopt delay-line clocking. In the present study, we demonstrate AQFP logic\ngates (AND and XOR gates) that use delay-line clocking as a step towards\nimplementing large-scale AQFP circuits with delay-line clocking. AND and XOR\ngates with a latency of approximately 20 ps per gate are shown to operate at up\nto 5 and 4 GHz, respectively, in experiments. We also demonstrate that\ndelay-line clocking enables phase skipping operation, in which some of the AQFP\nbuffers for phase synchronization are removed to reduce the junction count and\nenergy dissipation. The results indicate that delay-line clocking can enable\nlow-latency, low-energy, large-scale AQFP circuits.\n",

Here we study the following\nproblem: what functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^k \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can be computed by a\nCRN, in which the CRN eventually produces the correct amount of the \"output\"\nmolecule, no matter the rate at which reactions proceed? This captures a\npreviously unexplored, but very natural class of computations: for example, the\nreaction $X_1 + X_2 \\to Y$ can be thought to compute the function $y =\n\\min(x_1, x_2)$. Such a CRN is robust in the sense that it is correct no matter\nthe kinetic model of chemistry, so long as it respects the stoichiometric\nconstraints.\n  We develop a reachability relation based on \"what could happen\" if reaction\nrates can vary arbitrarily over time. We define *stable computation*\nanalogously to probability 1 computation in distributed computing, and connect\nit with a seemingly stronger notion of rate-independent computation based on\nconvergence under a wide class of generalized rate laws. We also consider the\n\"dual-rail representation\" that can represent negative values as the difference\nof two concentrations and allows the composition of CRN modules. We prove that\na function is rate-independently computable if and only if it is piecewise\nlinear (with rational coefficients) and continuous (dual-rail representation),\nor non-negative with discontinuities occurring only when some inputs switch\nfrom zero to positive (direct representation). The many contexts where\ncontinuous piecewise linear functions are powerful targets for implementation,\ncombined with the systematic construction we develop for computing these\nfunctions, demonstrate the potential of rate-independent chemical computation.\n",

The statistical characterization\nof the reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible\nbi-molecular reaction of NTs and receptors renders the system nonlinear.\nConsequently, existing models for the receptor occupancy in the synaptic cleft\nrely on simplifying assumptions and approximations which limit their practical\napplicability.

This new algorithm is reported with a lab on\nchip or digital Microfluidic biochip to operate multiple operation on a tiny\nchip. We can use Digital Microfluidic biochip to operate multiple operation on\na tiny chip. Samples are very costly which are used in any Biochemical\nlaboratory Protocols. For the case of fast and high throughput application, It\nis essential to minimize the cost of operations and the time of operations and\nthat is why one of the most challenging and important phase is sample\npreparation. In our proposed algorithm, we have hide to reduce sample droplets\nand waste droplets and for this purpose waste recycling is used, when different\nseries of multi gradient targets concentration factors (CFS) are generated. We\nhave compared our proposed algorithm with recent dilution techniques such as\nMTC, REMIA, and WARA. For the storage of intermediate droplets which, and\ngenerated during this process, on chip storage space 0(n) is needed.

Therefore, to meet the increasing demand in space links,\nTerahertz band (0.1-10 THz) wireless communications are proposed in this study.\nIn line with this, we discuss the major challenges that the realization of THz\nband space links pose and possible solutions. Moreover, we simulate Mars-space\nTHz links for the case of a clear Mars atmosphere, and a heavy dust storm to\nshow that even in the worst conditions, a large bandwidth is available for Mars\ncommunication traffic.\n",

However, the development of efficient hardware to accelerate DRF\nis lagging behind its DNN counterparts. The key for hardware acceleration of\nDRF lies in efficiently realizing the branch-split operation at decision nodes\nwhen traversing a decision tree. In this work, we propose to implement DRF\nthrough simple associative searches realized with ferroelectric analog content\naddressable memory (ACAM).

The DRF accelerator\narchitecture and the corresponding mapping of the DRF model to the ACAM arrays\nare presented. The functionality, characteristics, and scalability of the FeFET\nACAM based DRF and its robustness against FeFET device non-idealities are\nvalidated both in experiments and simulations. Evaluation results show that the\nFeFET ACAM DRF accelerator exhibits 10^6x/16x and 10^6x/2.5x improvements in\nterms of energy and latency when compared with other deep random forest\nhardware implementations on the state-of-the-art CPU/ReRAM, respectively.\n",

Their optical cavities are\nwavelength-limited, and standard semiconductor growth and lithography enables\nnon-classical cavity configurations and geometries. This enables excitable\nVCSELs (i.e. spiking VCSELs) to finely control their temporal and spatial\ncoherence, to unlock Terahertz bandwidths through spin-flip effects, and even\nto leverage cavity quantum electrodynamics to further boost their efficiency.\nFinally, as VCSEL arrays they are compatible with standard 2D photonic\nintegration, but their emission vertical to the substrate makes them ideally\nsuited for scalable integrated networks leveraging 3D photonic waveguides.\nHere, we discuss the implementation of spatially as well as temporally\nmultiplexed VCSEL neural networks and reservoirs, computation on the basis of\nexcitable VCSELs as photonic spiking neurons, as well as concepts and advances\nin the fabrication of VCSELs and microlasers.\n",

Nevertheless, the underlying network is prone to deadlock,\ndespite deadlock-free chiplets, and to different faults on the vertical links\nused for connecting the chiplets to the interposer. Unfortunately, existing\nfault-tolerant routing techniques proposed for 2D and 3D on-chip networks\ncannot be applied to chiplet networks. To address these problems, this paper\npresents the first deadlock-free and fault-tolerant routing algorithm, called\nDeFT, for 2.5D integrated chiplet systems. DeFT improves the redundancy in\nvertical-link selection to tolerate faults in vertical links while considering\nnetwork congestion. Moreover, DeFT can tolerate different vertical-link-fault\nscenarios while accounting for vertical-link utilization. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art routing algorithms in 2.5D chiplet systems, our simulation\nresults show that DeFT improves network reachability by up to 75% with a fault\nrate of up to 25% and reduces the network latency by up to 40% for\nmulti-application execution scenarios with less than 2% area overhead.\n",

        "summary": "  Present-day quantum communication predominantly depends on trusted relays\n(e.g., quantum repeaters, low-Earth-orbit satellite) connected by optical fiber\ncables to transmit information. However, recent evidence supports a decades-old\nconcept that quantum entanglement, harnessed by current quantum communication\nsystems, does not necessarily rely on a physical relay medium. In modern\nquantum communication networks, this trusted relay infrastructure is (1)\nsusceptible to security attacks, (2) limited by the channel capacity, (3)\nsubject to decoherence loss, and (4) expensive to set up. The instantaneous and\nfaster-than-light activities of quantum entanglement occurring in quantum\ncommunication have suggested guidance by some non-locality nature. On the\ncontrary, neither ground nor space-relays have shown or been demonstrated to\nembody it. It is proposed in this paper that the non-locality nature of quantum\ntheory governs quantum entanglement; elementary particles, components of a\nuniversal quantum body, can achieve remote entanglement regardless of a\nphysical medium or spatial proximity. Evidence and theory supporting remote\nentanglement in superconducting quantum systems (entanglement fidelities for\ncommunication in particular) are presented. One such particle, the photon,\nrepresenting a basic unit of quantum information, qubit $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha\n|0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$, consists of real continuous values in complex\nnumbers $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ with infinite precision. These values $(\\alpha,\n\\beta)$ can account for the distinctiveness of qubits and result in an identity\n$QuID$ that possibly supports remote entanglement. New approaches to\nmedium-free secure quantum communication are suggested by running simulations\nand actual quantum computations on a quantum circuit.\n",

Numerous efforts are underway to lower power\nconsumption, but a fundamental bottleneck remains due to energy consumption in\nmatrix algebra, even for analog approaches including neuromorphic, analog\nmemory and photonic meshes. Here we introduce and demonstrate a new approach\nthat sharply reduces energy required for matrix algebra by doing away with\nweight memory access on edge devices, enabling orders of magnitude energy and\nlatency reduction. At the core of our approach is a new concept that\ndecentralizes the DNN for delocalized, optically accelerated matrix algebra on\nedge devices. Using a silicon photonic smart transceiver, we demonstrate\nexperimentally that this scheme, termed Netcast, dramatically reduces energy\nconsumption. We demonstrate operation in a photon-starved environment with 40\naJ/multiply of optical energy for 98.8% accurate image recognition and <1\nphoton/multiply using single photon detectors. Furthermore, we show realistic\ndeployment of our system, classifying images with 3 THz of bandwidth over 86 km\nof deployed optical fiber in a Boston-area fiber network. Our approach enables\ncomputing on a new generation of edge devices with speeds comparable to modern\ndigital electronics and power consumption that is orders of magnitude lower.\n",

Qubits exploit the quantum physics\nproprieties to increase the parallelism and speed of computation.\nUnfortunately, besides being intrinsically noisy, qubits have also been shown\nto be highly susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing\nradiation. The latest discoveries highlight a much higher radiation sensitivity\nof qubits than traditional transistors and identify a much more complex fault\nmodel than bit-flip. We propose a framework to identify the quantum circuits\nsensitivity to radiation-induced faults and the probability for a fault in a\nqubit to propagate to the output. Based on the latest studies and radiation\nexperiments performed on real quantum machines, we model the transient faults\nin a qubit as a phase shift with a parametrized magnitude. Additionally, our\nframework can inject multiple qubit faults, tuning the phase shift magnitude\nbased on the proximity of the qubit to the particle strike location. As we show\nin the paper, the proposed fault injector is highly flexible, and it can be\nused on both quantum circuit simulators and real quantum machines. We report\nthe finding of more than 285M injections on the Qiskit simulator and 53K\ninjections on real IBM machines. We consider three quantum algorithms and\nidentify the faults and qubits that are more likely to impact the output. We\nalso consider the fault propagation dependence on the circuit scale, showing\nthat the reliability profile for some quantum algorithms is scale-dependent,\nwith increased impact from radiation-induced faults as we increase the number\nof qubits. Finally, we also consider multi qubits faults, showing that they are\nmuch more critical than single faults.

A\npreviously understudied type of shifting fault, a pinning fault may occur due\nto non-uniform pinning potential distribution caused by notches with\nfabrication imperfections.

The von Neumann architecture is also inefficient in solving\nunstructured, probabilistic, and real-time problems. To address these\nchallenges, a new brain-inspired neuromorphic computational architecture is\nrequired. Due to absence of resistance-capacitance (RC) delay, high bandwidth\nand low power consumption, optoelectronic artificial synaptic devices are\nhighly attractive. Yet stable, scalable, and\ncomplementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible synapses have not\nbeen demonstrated. In this work, persistence in the photoconductivity of\nundoped and magnesium-doped scandium nitride (ScN) is equated to the inhibitory\nand excitatory synaptic plasticity of the biological synapses responsible for\nmemory and learning. Primary functionalities of a biological synapse like\nshort-term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM), the transition from\nSTM-to-LTM, learning and forgetting, frequency-selective optical filtering,\nfrequency-dependent potentiation and depression, Hebbian learning, and logic\ngate operations are demonstrated.\n",

Here, we introduce a novel\narchitecture that supports coherent and incoherent operation to increase the\ncapability and capacity of photonic neural networks with a dramatic reduction\nin footprint compared to previous demonstrations. As a proof-of-principle, we\nexperimentally demonstrate simple addition and subtraction operations on a\nfoundry-fabricated silicon photonic chip. Additionally, we experimentally\nvalidate an on-chip network to predict the logical 2-bit gates AND, OR, and XOR\nto accuracies of $96.8\\%, 99\\%,$ and $98.5\\%$, respectively. This architecture\nis compatible with highly wavelength parallel sources, enabling massively\nscalable photonic neural networks.\n",

We first focus on a special case that only allows\ncat-entanglements and not teleportations for communication.

With their exponential growth challenging existing electronic\nhardware, optical neural networks (ONNs) are emerging to process DNN tasks in\nthe optical domain with high clock rates, parallelism and low-loss data\ntransmission. However, to explore the potential of ONNs, it is necessary to\ninvestigate the full-system performance incorporating the major DNN elements,\nincluding matrix algebra and nonlinear activation. Existing challenges to ONNs\nare high energy consumption due to low electro-optic (EO) conversion\nefficiency, low compute density due to large device footprint and channel\ncrosstalk, and long latency due to the lack of inline nonlinearity. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate an ONN system that simultaneously overcomes all\nthese challenges. We exploit neuron encoding with volume-manufactured\nmicron-scale vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) transmitter arrays\nthat exhibit high EO conversion (<5 attojoule/symbol with $V_\\pi$=4 mV), high\noperation bandwidth (up to 25 GS/s), and compact footprint (<0.01 mm$^2$ per\ndevice). Photoelectric multiplication allows low-energy matrix operations at\nthe shot-noise quantum limit. Homodyne detection-based nonlinearity enables\nnonlinear activation with instantaneous response. The full-system energy\nefficiency and compute density reach 7 femtojoules per operation (fJ/OP) and 25\nTeraOP/(mm$^2\\cdot$ s), both representing a >100-fold improvement over\nstate-of-the-art digital computers, with substantially several more orders of\nmagnitude for future improvement.

This has motivated a search for new hardware architectures\noptimized for artificial intelligence, such as electronic systolic arrays,\nmemristor crossbar arrays, and optical accelerators. Optical systems can\nperform linear matrix operations at exceptionally high rate and efficiency,\nmotivating recent demonstrations of low latency linear algebra and optical\nenergy consumption below a photon per multiply-accumulate operation. However,\ndemonstrating systems that co-integrate both linear and nonlinear processing\nunits in a single chip remains a central challenge.

Algorithmic\naTAM systems can be designed in which the patterns of tile attachments are\nforced to follow the execution of targeted algorithms. Such systems have been\nproven to be computationally universal as well as intrinsically universal (IU),\na notion borrowed and adapted from cellular automata showing that a single tile\nset exists which is capable of simulating all aTAM systems (FOCS 2012). The\ninput to an algorithmic aTAM system can be provided in a variety of ways, with\na common method being via the \"seed\" assembly, which is a pre-formed assembly\nfrom which all growth propagates. In this paper we present a series of results\nwhich investigate the the trade-offs of using seeds consisting of a single\ntile, versus those containing multiple tiles. We show that arbitrary systems\nwith multi-tile seeds cannot be converted to functionally equivalent systems\nwith single-tile seeds without using a scale factor > 1. We prove tight bounds\non the scale factor required, and also present a construction which uses a\nlarge scale factor but an optimal number of unique tile types.

Moreover, neuromorphic photonic approaches based upon ubiquitous,\ntechnology-mature and low-cost Vertical-Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs)\n(devices found in fibre-optic transmitters, mobile phones, automotive sensors,\netc.) are of particular interest. Given VCSELs have shown the ability to\nrealise neuronal optical spiking responses (at ultrafast GHz rates), their use\nfor spike-based information processing systems has been proposed. In this work,\nSpiking Neural Network (SNN) operation, based on a hardware-friendly photonic\nsystem of just one Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL), is reported\nalongside a novel binary weight 'significance' training scheme that fully\ncapitalises on the discrete nature of the optical spikes used by the SNN to\nprocess input information.

Excellent classification accuracies of >94% are\nreached by both training methods, exceeding the benchmark performance of the\ndataset in a fraction of processing time.

The stochastic switching of magnetic tunnel junction driven\nby the spin torque is commonly used to produce the sigmoid activation function.\nHowever, the shape of the activation function in previous studies is fixed\nduring the training of neural network. This restricts the updating of weights\nand results in a limited performance. In this work, we exploit the physics\nbehind the spin torque induced magnetization switching to enable the dynamic\nchange of the activation function during the training process. Specifically,\nthe pulse width and magnetic anisotropy can be electrically controlled to\nchange the slope of activation function, which enables a faster or slower\nchange of output required by the backpropagation algorithm. This is also\nsimilar to the idea of batch normalization that is widely used in the machine\nlearning. Thus, this work demonstrates that the algorithms are no longer\nlimited to the software implementation. They can in fact be realized by the\nspintronic hardware using a single device. Finally, we show that the accuracy\nof hand-written digit recognition can be improved from 88% to 91.3% by using\nthese trainable spintronic neurons without introducing additional energy\nconsumption.

Proposed\ndevices based on the bio-compatible conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS have shown\nhigh switching speeds and low energy demand. However, as electrochemical\nsystems, they are prone to self-discharge through parasitic electrochemical\nreactions. Therefore, the network's synapses forget their trained conductance\nstates over time. This work integrates single-device high-resolution charge\ntransport models to simulate neuromorphic device networks and analyze the\nimpact of self-discharge on network performance. Simulation of a single-layer\nnine-pixel image classification network reveals no significant impact of\nself-discharge on training efficiency. And, even though the network's weights\ndrift significantly during self-discharge, its predictions remain 100\\%\naccurate for over ten hours. On the other hand, a multi-layer network for the\napproximation of the circle function is shown to degrade significantly over\ntwenty minutes with a final mean-squared-error loss of 0.4. We propose to\ncounter the effect by periodically reminding the network based on a map between\na synapse's current state, the time since the last reminder, and the weight\ndrift. We show that this method with a map obtained through validated\nsimulations can reduce the effective loss to below 0.1 even with worst-case\nassumptions. Finally, while the training of this network is affected by\nself-discharge, a good classification is still obtained. Electrochemical\norganic neuromorphic devices have not been integrated into larger device\nnetworks.

It can also recognize the input frequency and\nmagnitude patterns. Furthermore, multitasking is achievable by simultaneously\napplying two targeted functions to the same reservoir state matrix. Therefore,\nwe demonstrate that Miura-ori can assess the dynamic interactions between its\nbody and ambient environment to extract meaningful information -- an\nintelligent behavior in the mechanical domain. Given that Miura-ori has been\nwidely used to construct deployable structures, lightweight materials, and\ncompliant robots, enabling such information perception tasks can add a new\ndimension to the functionality of such a versatile structure.\n",

As giant generative models with millions to billions of\nparameters are developed, trained and maintained, a massive and\nenergy-efficient computing power is highly required. However, conventional\ndigital computers are struggling to keep up with the pace of the generative\nmodel improvements. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate high-throughput\noptical neural networks based on temporal computing. The core weighted\nsummation operation is realized with the use of high-speed electro-optic\nmodulation and low-speed balanced photodetection. The input data and weight are\nencoded in a time sequence separately and loaded on an optical signal via two\nelectro-optic modulators sequentially. By precisely controlling the\nsynchronization time of the data and weight loading, the matrix multiplication\nis performed. Followed by a balanced photodetector, the summation is conducted,\nthanks to the electron accumulation of the inherent electronic integrator\ncircuit of the low-speed photodetector. Thus, the linear weighted summation\noperation is implemented based on temporal computing in the optical domain.\nWith the proposed optical linear weighted summation, a fully-connected neural\nnetwork and convolutional neural network are realized. Thanks to the high-speed\nfeature of temporal computing, a high data throughput of the optical neural\nnetwork is experimentally demonstrated, and the weighting coefficients can be\nspecified on demand, which enables a strong programmability of the optical\nneural network. By leveraging wavelength multiplexing technology, a scalable\noptical neural network could be created with a massive computing power and\nstrong reconfigurability, which holds great potential for future giant AI\napplications.\n",

This involvement of untrustworthy, external entities opens the door to\nmajor security threats, such as reverse engineering (RE). RE can reveal the\nphysical structure and functionality of intellectual property (IP) and ICs,\nleading to IP theft, counterfeiting, and other misuses. The concept of the\nthreshold voltage-defined (TVD) logic family is a potential mechanism to\nobfuscate and protect the design and prevent RE. However, it addresses\npost-fabrication RE issues, and it has been shown that dopant profiling\ntechniques can be used to determine the threshold voltage of the transistor and\nbreak the obfuscation. In this work, we propose a novel TVD modulation with\nion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs) to protect the IC from RE and\nIP piracy. Compared to the conventional TVD logic family, ISFET-TVD allows\npost-manufacture programming. The ISFET-TVD logic gate can be reconfigured\nafter fabrication, maintaining an exact schematic architecture with an\nidentical layout for all types of logic gates, and thus overcoming the\nshortcomings of the classic TVD. The threshold voltage of the ISFETs can be\nadjusted after fabrication by changing the ion concentration of the material in\ncontact with the ion-sensitive gate of the transistor, depending on the Boolean\nfunctionality.

Feed-forward neural networks\nare one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms due to their\nsimplicity and universal approximation capability. However, the typical\ntraining procedure, where all weights are optimized, can be time and energy\nconsuming. An alternative approach is the Extreme Learning Machine, a\nfeed-forward neural network in which only the output weights are trained, while\nthe internal connections are random. Here we present an experimental\nimplementation of a photonic extreme learning machine (PELM) in an integrated\nsilicon chip. The PELM is based on the processing of the image of the scattered\nlight by an array of 18 gratings coupled to microresonators. Light propagation\nin the microresonator array is a linear process while light detection by the\nvideo camera is a nonlinear process. Training is done offline by analyzing the\nrecorded scattered light image with a linear classifier. We provide a\nproof-of-concept demonstration of the PELM by solving both binary and analog\ntasks, and show how the performance depends on the number of microresonators\nused in the readout procedure.\n",

Reaching the ground state is equivalent\nto finding the maximum (weighted) cut of the graph, which presents the Ising\nmachines as an alternative way to solving and investigating NP-complete\nproblems. Among the dynamical models, relaxation-based models are distinguished\nby their relations with guarantees of performance achieved in time scaling\npolynomially with the problem size. However, the terminal states of such\nmachines are essentially non-binary, necessitating special post-processing\nrelying on disparate computing. We show that an Ising machine implementing a\nspecial continuous dynamical system (called the V${}_2$ model) solves the\nrounding problem dynamically. We prove that the V${}_2$ model, starting from an\narbitrary non-binary state, terminates in a state that trivially rounds to a\nbinary state with the cut at least as big as obtained by optimal rounding of\nthe initial state. Besides showing that relaxation-based dynamical Ising\nmachines can be made self-contained, this result presents a non-Boolean\nrealization of solving a non-trivial information processing task on Ising\nmachines. Moreover, we prove that if the initial state of the V${}_2$-machine\nis a random limited amplitude perturbation of a binary state, the machine\nprogresses to a state with at least as high cut as that of the initial binary\nstate. Since the probability of improving the cut is finite, this shows that\nthe V${}_2$-machine with random agitations converges to a maximum cut state\nalmost surely.\n",

The communication is based on sending molecules (or other particles)\nat nano scale through channel instead sending electrons over a wire. Molecular\ncommunication devices have a large potential in medical applications as they\noffer an alternative to antenna-based transmission systems that may not be\napplicable due to size, temperature, or radiation constraints. The\ncommunication is achieved by transforming a digital signal into concentrations\nof molecules. These molecules are then detected at the other end of the\ncommunication channel and transformed back into a digital signal. Accurately\nmodeling the transmission channel is often not possible which may be due to a\nlack of data or time-varying parameters of the channel (e. g., the movements of\na person wearing a medical device). This makes demodulation of the signal very\ndifficult. Many approaches for demodulation have been discussed with one\nparticular approach having tremendous success: artificial neural networks.\nThese networks imitate the decision process in the human brain and are capable\nof reliably classifying noisy input data. Training such a network relies on a\nlarge set of training data. As molecular communication as a technology is still\nin its early development phase, this data is not always readily available. We\ndiscuss neural network-based demodulation approaches relying on synthetic data\nbased on theoretical channel models as well as works using actual measurements\nproduced by a prototype test bed. In this work, we give a general overview over\nthe field molecular communication, discuss the challenges in the demodulations\nprocess of transmitted signals, and present approaches to these challenges that\nare based on artificial neural networks.\n",

A\nviable approach for the execution of quantum classification algorithms is the\nintroduction of a well-known machine learning paradigm, namely, the ensemble\nmethods. Indeed, the ensembles combine multiple internal classifiers, which are\ncharacterized by compact sizes due to the smaller data subsets used for\ntraining, to achieve more accurate and robust prediction performance. In this\nway, it is possible to reduce the qubits requirements with respect to a single\nlarger classifier while achieving comparable or improved performance. In this\nwork, we present an implementation and an extensive empirical evaluation of\nensembles of quantum classifiers for binary classification, with the purpose of\nproviding insights into their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for\nenhancing the performance of basic quantum models. In particular, three\nclassical ensemble methods and three quantum classifiers have been taken into\naccount here. Hence, the scheme that has been implemented (in Python) has a\nhybrid nature. The results (obtained on real-world datasets) have shown an\naccuracy advantage for the ensemble techniques with respect to the single\nquantum classifiers, and also an improvement in robustness.

In particular,\ndendritic branches play a key role in temporal signal processing and feature\ndetection, using coincidence detection (CD) mechanisms, made possible by the\npresence of synaptic delays that align temporally disparate inputs for\neffective integration. Computational studies on spiking neural networks further\nhighlight the significance of delays for CD operations, enabling\nspatio-temporal pattern recognition within feed-forward neural networks without\nthe need for recurrent architectures. In this work, we present DenRAM, the\nfirst realization of a spiking neural network with analog dendritic circuits,\nintegrated into a 130nm technology node coupled with resistive memory (RRAM)\ntechnology. DenRAM's dendritic circuits use the RRAM devices to implement both\ndelays and synaptic weights in the network.

The device contains 21 monolithic\nmembrane valves that act like transistors in a pneumatic logic \"circuit\" that\nuses vacuum to represent TRUE and atmospheric pressure as FALSE. Three\npneumatic exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are used to calculate the parity bit\ncorresponding to the values of several control bits.

As a proof-of-concept, we used our pneumatic error detector\nto monitor the operation of a medical device, an intermittent pneumatic\ncompression (IPC) device commonly used to prevent the formation of\nlife-threatening blood clots in the wearer's legs. Experiments confirm that\nwhen the IPC device was damaged, the pneumatic error detector immediately\nrecognized the error (a leak) and alerted the wearer using sound.

These effects originate from corresponding physical\nand chemical processes in memristive devices. A physics-inspired compact model\nis employed to model and simulate interface-type RRAMs such as\nAu/BiFeO$_{3}$/Pt/Ti, Au/Nb$_{\\rm x}$O$_{\\rm y}$/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Nb, while\naccounting for the modeling of capacitive and inertia effects.

        "summary": "  Deep learning has proved successful in many applications but suffers from\nhigh computational demands and requires custom accelerators for deployment.\nCrossbar-based analog in-memory architectures are attractive for acceleration\nof deep neural networks (DNN), due to their high data reuse and high efficiency\nenabled by combining storage and computation in memory. However, they require\nanalog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to communicate crossbar outputs. ADCs\nconsume a significant portion of energy and area of every crossbar processing\nunit, thus diminishing the potential efficiency benefits. Pruning is a\nwell-studied technique to improve the efficiency of DNNs but requires\nmodifications to be effective for crossbars. In this paper, we motivate\ncrossbar-attuned pruning to target ADC-specific inefficiencies. This is\nachieved by identifying three key properties (dubbed D.U.B.) that induce\nsparsity that can be utilized to reduce ADC energy without sacrificing\naccuracy. The first property ensures that sparsity translates effectively to\nhardware efficiency by restricting sparsity levels to Discrete powers of 2. The\nother 2 properties encourage columns in the same crossbar to achieve both\nUnstructured and Balanced sparsity in order to amortize the accuracy drop. The\ndesired D.U.B. sparsity is then achieved by regularizing the variance of\n$L_{0}$ norms of neighboring columns within the same crossbar. Our proposed\nimplementation allows it to be directly used in end-to-end gradient-based\ntraining. We apply the proposed algorithm to convolutional layers of VGG11 and\nResNet18 models, trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and achieve up to\n7.13x and 1.27x improvement, respectively, in ADC energy with less than 1% drop\nin accuracy.\n",

In this paper, we investigate intelligent reflecting\nsurface (IRS) enabled wireless localization, in which an IRS is deployed to\nassist a BS in locating a target in its non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region. In\nparticular, we consider the case where the BS-IRS channel state information\n(CSI) is unknown. Specifically, we first propose a separate BS-IRS channel\nestimation scheme in which the BS operates in full-duplex mode (FDM), i.e., a\nportion of the BS antennas send downlink pilot signals to the IRS, while the\nremaining BS antennas receive the uplink pilot signals reflected by the IRS.\nHowever, we can only obtain an incomplete BS-IRS channel matrix based on our\ndeveloped iterative coordinate descent-based channel estimation algorithm due\nto the \"sign ambiguity issue\". Then, we employ the multiple hypotheses testing\nframework to perform target localization based on the incomplete estimated\nchannel, in which the probability of each hypothesis is updated using Bayesian\ninference at each cycle. Moreover, we formulate a joint BS transmit waveform\nand IRS phase shifts optimization problem to improve the target localization\nperformance by maximizing the weighted sum distance between each two\nhypotheses. However, the objective function is essentially a quartic function\nof the IRS phase shift vector, thus motivating us to resort to the\npenalty-based method to tackle this challenge. Simulation results validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed target localization scheme and show that the\nscheme's performance can be further improved by finely designing the BS\ntransmit waveform and IRS phase shifts intending to maximize the weighted sum\ndistance between different hypotheses.\n",

To meet these, more complex software applications, some of\nwhich require service-based cloud and edge backends, are developed. When new\nsoftware is deployed however, the high complexity and interdependencies between\ncomponents can lead to unforeseen side effects in other system parts. As such,\nit becomes more challenging to recognize whether deviations to the intended\nsystem behavior are occurring, ultimately resulting in higher monitoring\nefforts and slower responses to errors. To overcome this problem, a simulation\nof the cloud environment running in parallel to the system is proposed. This\napproach enables the live comparison between simulated and real cloud behavior.\nTherefore, a concept is developed mirroring the existing cloud system into a\nsimulation. To collect the necessary data, an observability platform is\npresented, capturing telemetry and architecture information. Subsequently, a\nsimulation environment is designed that converts the architecture into a\nsimulation model and simulates its dynamic workload by utilizing captured\ncommunication data. The proposed concept is evaluated in a real-world\napplication scenario for electric vehicle charging: Vehicles can apply for an\nunoccupied charging station at a cloud service backend, the latter which\nmanages all incoming requests and performs the assignment. Benchmarks are\nconducted by comparing the collected telemetry data with the simulated results\nunder different loads and injected faults.

Reconfigurable\nArchitecture for Neuromorphic Computing (RANC) is one such tool that offers\nability to execute pre-trained Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models within a\nunified ecosystem through both software-based simulation and FPGA-based\nemulation. RANC has been utilized by the community with its flexible and highly\nparameterized design to study implementation bottlenecks, tune architectural\nparameters or modify neuron behavior based on application insights and study\nthe trade space on hardware performance and network accuracy. In designing\narchitectures for use in neuromorphic computing, there are an incredibly large\nnumber of configuration parameters such as number and precision of weights per\nneuron, neuron and axon counts per core, network topology, and neuron behavior.\nTo accelerate such studies and provide users with a streamlined productive\ndesign space exploration, in this paper we introduce the GPU-based\nimplementation of RANC. We summarize our parallelization approach and quantify\nthe speedup gains achieved with GPU-based tick-accurate simulations across\nvarious use cases. We demonstrate up to 780 times speedup compared to serial\nversion of the RANC simulator based on a 512 neuromorphic core MNIST inference\napplication. We believe that the RANC ecosystem now provides a much more\nfeasible avenue in the research of exploring different optimizations for\naccelerating SNNs and performing richer studies by enabling rapid convergence\nto optimized neuromorphic architectures.\n",

Data from Sky (DFS) is one such\ntool, based on image processing and artificial intelligence (AI), that provides\noutput for macroscopic as well as microscopic variables of the traffic streams.\nThe company claims to provide 98 to 100 percent accuracy on the data exported\nusing DFS tool. The tool is widely used in developed countries where the\ntraffic is homogenous and has lane-based movements. In this study, authors have\nchecked the veracity of DFS tool in heterogenous and area-based traffic\nmovement that is prevailing in most developing countries. The validation is\ndone using various methods using Classified Volume Count (CVC), Space Mean\nSpeeds (SMS) of individual vehicle classes and microscopic trajectory of probe\nvehicle to verify DFS claim. The error for CVCs for each vehicle class present\nin the traffic stream is estimated. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)\nvalues are calculated for average speeds of each vehicle class between manually\nand DFS extracted space mean speeds (SMSs), and the microscopic trajectories\nare validated using a GPS based tracker put on probe vehicles. The results are\nfairly accurate in the case of data taken from a bird eye view with least\nerrors. The other configurations of data collection have some significant\nerrors, that are majorly caused by the varied traffic composition, the view of\ncamera angle, and the direction of traffic.\n",

In contrast to existing studies, where single-tier LEO satellite-based\nnetwork deployments are considered, the developed framework captures the\nheterogeneous nature of real-world satellite network deployments. More\nspecifically, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the performance of\nmulti-tier LEO satellite-based networks, where the locations of LEO satellites\nare approximated as points of independent Poisson point processes, with\ndifferent density, transmit power, and altitude. We propose three association\nschemes for the considered network topology based on: 1) the Euclidean\ndistance, 2) the average received power, and 3) a random selection. By using\nstochastic geometry tools, analytical expressions for the association\nprobability, the downlink coverage probability, as well as the spectral\nefficiency are derived for each association scheme, where the interference is\nconsidered. Moreover, we assess the achieved network performance under several\ndifferent fading environments, including low, typical, and severe fading\nconditions, namely non-fading, shadowed-Rician and Rayleigh fading channels,\nrespectively. Our results reveal the impact of fading channels on the coverage\nprobability, and illustrate that the average power-based association scheme\noutperforms in terms of achieved coverage and spectral efficiency performance\nagainst the other two association policies.

To realize these\nbenefits in a full system (accelerator + DRAM), designers must ensure that the\nbenefits of using the electrical, optical, analog, and digital domains exceed\nthe costs of converting data between domains. Designers must also consider\nsystem-level energy costs such as data fetch from DRAM.

In this work, we show that similarities between\nCompute-in-Memory (CiM) and photonics let us use CiM system modeling tools to\naccurately model photonics systems. Bringing modeling tools to photonics\nenables evaluation of photonic research in a full-system context, rapid design\nspace exploration, co-design, and comparison between systems.

A reliable handover method may reduce the\ninstances of unstable or frequent handovers that otherwise waste network\nresources. The signal strength measurement process is inherently time consuming\nas the user equipment (UE) has to measure multiple neighboring eNB (NeNB)\nfrequencies in each measurement period.

The\nproposed scheme outperforms the existing LTE-A handover methods. The improved\nperformance is achieved by selecting the TeNB based on some three independent\nparameters, namely orientation matching (OM), current load (CL), and the\nreceived signal strengths. An UE essentially measures only the NeNBs\nshortlisted based on OM and CL; thus measurement time is reduced considerably\nleading to a reduction of overall handover time.

The proposed\napproximate full adders are evaluated in three image processing applications in\nthree scenarios.

This\npaper stresses the necessity of transitioning from centralized to distributed\nSDA architectures. The current architecture predominantly relies on individual\ndownhaul, which we propose to transition to on-orbit distribution. Our results\ndemonstrate that the individual downhaul architecture does not scale\nefficiently with the increasing number of nodes, while on-orbit distribution\noffers significant improvements. By comparing the centralized architecture with\nthe proposed distributed architecture, we highlight the advantages of enhanced\ncoverage and resilience. Our findings show that on-orbit distribution greatly\noutperforms individual downhaul in terms of latency and scalability.\nSpecifically, the latency results for on-orbit distribution are substantially\nlower and more consistent, even as the number of satellites increases. In\naddition, we address the inherent challenges associated with on-orbit\ndistribution architecture, particularly cybersecurity concerns. We focus on\nlink security to ensure the availability and integrity of data transmission in\nthese advanced SDA systems.

RF Imaging is a technique that aims\nto detect geometric and material features of an object through RF waves. On the\nother hand, the PWE focuses on the the conversion of the wireless RF\npropagation in a controllable, by software, entity through the utilization of\nReconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), which can have a controllable\ninteraction with impinging RF waves. In that sense, this dynamic synergy\nleverages the potential of RF Imaging to detect the structure of an object\nthrough RF wavefronts and the PWE's ability to selectively replicate those RF\nwavefronts from one spatial location to wherever an XR-RF mobile user is\npresently located. Then the captured wavefront, through appropriate hardware,\nis mapped to the visual representation of the object through machine learning\nmodels. As a key aspect of the XR-RF's system workflow is the wavefront copying\nmechanism, this work introduces a new PWE configuration algorithm for XR-RF.\nMoreover, it is shown that the waveform replication process inevitably yields\nimprecision in the replication process. After statistical analysis, based on\nsimulation results, it is shown that this imprecision can be effectively\nmodeled by the gamma distribution.\n",

In SNNs, learning rules are based on neurons' spiking behavior, that\nis, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential\nexceeding that neuron's spiking threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital\ninformation. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter,\nand incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large\nportions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning.\nThis work focuses on the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside\nweights in SNNs. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a\nhyperparameter to a trainable parameter effectively addresses the issue of dead\nneurons during training. This leads to a more robust training algorithm,\nresulting in improved convergence, increased test accuracy, and a substantial\nreduction in the number of training epochs required to achieve viable accuracy\non spatiotemporal datasets such as NMNIST, DVS128, and Spiking Heidelberg\nDigits (SHD), with up to 30% training speed-up and up to 2% higher accuracy on\nthese datasets.\n",

We design simulations of quantum networks comprised of router\nnodes made up of trapped-ion qubits, separated by quantum repeaters in the form\nof Bell State Measurement (BSM) nodes. Such networks hold the promise of\nsecurely sharing quantum information and enabling high-power distributed\nquantum computing. Despite the promises, quantum networks encounter scalability\nissues due to noise and operational errors. Through a modular approach, our\nresearch aims to surmount these challenges, focusing on effects from scaling\nnode counts and separation distances while monitoring low-quality communication\narising from decoherence effects. We aim to pinpoint the critical features\nwithin networks essential for advancing scalable, large-scale quantum computing\nsystems. Our findings underscore the impact of several network parameters on\nscalability, highlighting a critical insight into the trade-offs between the\nnumber of repeaters and the quality of entanglement generated.

We survey\nexisting encoding methods and their respective strategies for\nclassical-to-quantum exact and approximate data loading, for the\nquantum-to-classical extraction of information from states, and for\nquantum-to-quantum encoding conversion. Next, we show how major quantum\nalgorithms find a natural interpretation in terms of data loading.

The\nnew conceptual framework is exemplified by considering its application to\nquantum-based Monte Carlo simulations, thus showcasing the power of the\nproposed formalism for the description of complex quantum circuits.

However,\nlimited bandwidth, latency, rain attenuation, long propagation delays, and\nco-channel interference pose challenges to efficient satellite communication.\nTherefore, semantic communication (SC) has emerged as a promising solution to\nimprove transmission efficiency and address these issues. In this paper, we\nexplore the potential of SC as a bandwidth-efficient, latency-minimizing\nstrategy specifically suited to 6G satellite communications. While existing SC\nmethods have demonstrated efficacy in direct satellite-terrestrial\ntransmissions, they encounter limitations in satellite networks due to\ndistortion accumulation across gateway hop-relays. Additionally, certain ground\nusers (GUs) experience poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), making direct\nsatellite communication challenging. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel framework that optimizes gateway hop-relay selection for GUs with low SNR\nand integrates gateway-based denoising mechanisms to ensure\nhigh-quality-of-service (QoS) in satellite-based SC networks. This approach\ndirectly mitigates distortion, leading to significant improvements in satellite\nservice performance by delivering customized services tailored to the unique\nsignal conditions of each GU.

Omni 3D\narbitrarily interleaves metal layers for both signal/power with FETs in 3D\n(i.e., nFETs and pFETs are stacked in 3D). Thus, signal/power routing layers\nhave fine-grained, all-sided access to the FET active regions maximizing 3D\nstandard cell design flexibility. This is in sharp contrast to approaches such\nas back-side power delivery networks (BSPDNs), complementary FETs (CFETs), and\nstacked FETs.

The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial\noptimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which\nnaturally converges to and stabilizes at a minimum energy state upon\nperturbance. The underlying mathematical abstraction, the Ising model, was\noriginally developed to explain dynamic behavior of ferromagnetic materials and\nwas shown to generalize to numerous other physical systems. In a generic\noptimization problem, each variable can interact with another in different\nways. At the same time, problem sizes of practical importance are growing very\nfast. Unfortunately, both the number and connectivity of spins in hardware are\nsubject to fundamental physical limits. Different problems feature different\ninteraction patterns between variables which may not always directly match the\nnetwork topology supported by a specific Ising machine. In the presence of a\nmismatch, emulating generic interactions using the machine topology is usually\npossible, however, comes at the cost of additional physical spins to facilitate\nthe mapping. Furthermore, mismatches in the problem vs. hardware connectivity\nrender even more physical spins necessary. Combinatorial optimization problems\nof practical importance come with diverse connectivity patterns, which a rigid\nnetwork topology in hardware cannot efficiently cover. To bridge the gap\nbetween application demand and hardware resources, in analogy to classical\nheterogeneous chip multiprocessors, in this paper we make the case for\nheterogeneous Ising multiprocessors, where each Ising core features a different\nconnectivity.

        "summary": "  Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a pivotal technology for memory disaggregation\nin future heterogeneous computing systems, enabling on-demand memory expansion\nand improved resource utilization. Despite its potential, CXL is in its early\nstages with limited market products, highlighting the need for a reliable\nsystem-level simulation tool. This paper introduces CXL-DMSim, an open-source,\nhigh-fidelity full-system simulator for CXL disaggregated memory systems,\ncomparable in speed to gem5. CXL-DMSim includes a flexible CXL memory expander\nmodel, device driver, and support for CXL\\.io and CXL\\.mem protocols. It\nsupports both app-managed and kernel-managed modes, with the latter featuring a\nNUMA-compatible mechanism. Rigorous verification against real hardware testbeds\nwith FPGA-based and ASIC-based CXL memory prototypes confirms CXL-DMSim's\naccuracy, with an average simulation error of 4.1%. Benchmark results using\nLMbench and STREAM indicate that CXL-FPGA memory has approximately ~2.88x\nhigher latency than local DDR, while CXL-ASIC latency is about ~2.18x. CXL-FPGA\nachieves 45-69% of local DDR's memory bandwidth, and CXL-ASIC reaches 82-83%.\nThe performance of CXL memory is significantly more sensitive to Rd/Wr patterns\nthan local DDR, with optimal bandwidth at a 74%:26% ratio rather than 50%:50%\ndue to the current CXL+DDR controller design. The study also shows that CXL\nmemory can markedly enhance the performance of memory-intensive applications,\nwith the most improvement seen in Viper (~23x) and in bandwidth-sensitive\nscenarios like MERCI (16%). CXL-DMSim's observability and expandability are\ndemonstrated through detailed case studies, showcasing its potential for\nresearch on future CXL-interconnected hybrid memory pools.\n",

Identifying\nresource-efficient analog system designs that mitigate these nonidealities is\ndone manually today.\n  While design optimization frameworks have been enormously successful in other\nfields, such as photonics, they typically either target linear dynamical\nsystems that have closed-form solutions or target a specific differential\nequation system and then derive the solution through hand analysis. In both\ncases, time-domain simulation is no longer needed to predict hardware behavior.\nIn contrast, described analog hardware platforms have nonlinear time-evolving\ndynamics that vary substantially from design to design, lack closed-form\nsolutions, and require the optimizer to consider time explicitly. We present\nShem, an optimization framework for analog systems. Shem leverages\ndifferentiation methods recently popularized to train neural ODEs to enable the\noptimization of analog systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics, noise and\nmismatch, and discrete behavior.

These PNA reservoir systems from prior works leverage echo state\nproperties and linear/nonlinear short-term memory of component reservoir nodes\nto map and preserve the dynamical information of the input time-series data\ninto nondelay spatial embeddings. Such mappings enable these PNA reservoir\nsystems to imitate and predict/forecast the input time series data.

The simulation results show that\nthe proposed scheme effectively reduces the energy consumption while ensuring\nflight robustness.

        "summary": "  In this paper, novel enhanced Cognitive Radio Network is considered by using\npower control where secondary users are allowed to use wireless resources of\nthe primary users when primary users are deactivated, but also allow secondary\nusers to coexist with primary users while primary users are activated by\nmanaging interference caused from secondary users to primary users. Therefore,\na novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is\nproposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced\ncognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under\ntwo cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference\n(SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for\nincreasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within\nfinite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed\nscheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher\ntarget SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower\nvalue for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period. In\norder to mitigate the attenuation of SIR due to channel uncertainties the\nproposed novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation\nallows the SIR of both primary users' and secondary users' to converge to a\ndesired target SIR while minimizing the energy consumption within finite\nhorizon. Simulation results illustrate that this novel finite horizon adaptive\noptimal distributed power allocation scheme can converge much faster and cost\nless energy than others by adapting to the channel variations optimally.\n",

The quality of\nspectrum sensing is evaluated by both sensing accuracy and sensing efficiency.\nHere, sensing accuracy is represented by the false alarm probability and the\ndetection probability while sensing efficiency is represented by the sensing\noverhead and network throughput. In this paper, we propose a group-based\ncooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses\nthe tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency. In GC-MAC, the\ncooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each\nteam senses a different channel while SUs in the same team perform the joint\ndetection on the targeted channel. The sensing process will not stop unless an\navailable channel is discovered. To reduce the sensing overhead, an\nSU-selecting algorithm is presented to selectively choose the cooperative SUs\nbased on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is\nbuilt to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of\nchannel conditions: time-invariant channel and time-varying channel. An\noptimization problem that maximizes achievable throughput is formulated to\noptimize the important design parameters. Both saturation and non-saturation\nsituations are investigated with respect to throughput and sensing overhead.\nSimulation results indicate that the proposed protocol is able to significantly\ndecrease sensing overhead and increase network throughput with guaranteed\nsensing accuracy.\n",

Equipped\nwith a rechargeable battery, a source node can harvest energy from ambient\nenvironments and rely on this free and regenerative energy supply to transmit\npackets. Due to the uncertainty of available energy from harvesting, however,\nintolerably large latency and packet loss could be induced, if the source\nalways waits for harvested energy. To overcome this problem, one Reliable\nEnergy Source (RES) can be resorted to for a prompt delivery of backlogged\npackets. Naturally, there exists a tradeoff between the packet delivery delay\nand power consumption from the RES. In this paper, we address the delay optimal\nscheduling problem for a bursty communication link powered by a\ncapacity-limited battery storing harvested energy together with one RES. The\nproposed scheduling scheme gives priority to the usage of harvested energy, and\nresorts to the RES when necessary based on the data and energy queueing\nprocesses, with an average power constraint from the RES. Through\ntwodimensional Markov chain modeling and linear programming formulation, we\nderive the optimal threshold-based scheduling policy together with the\ncorresponding transmission parameters.

Reservoir computing is an\napproach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time\ncomputing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a\ntime-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a\ndesired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the\ncomputational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated\nreadouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of\ninterconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal\namplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which\nimproves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number\nof output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small\nnetworks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform\ngeneration tasks. On the NARMA-10 task, we reduce the error by up to a factor\nof 2 compared to homogeneous reservoirs with sigmoidal neurons, whereas single\nmemristive networks are unable to produce the correct result. Hierarchical\ncomposition is key for solving more complex tasks with such novel nano-scale\nhardware.\n",

        "summary": "  Memristors have been suggested as a novel route to neuromorphic computing\nbased on the similarity between them and neurons (specifically synapses and ion\npumps). The d.c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a\nshort-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term\nmemory works exactly like habituation (e.g. in \\emph{Aplysia}). We elucidate\nthe physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of\nthese current spikes: summation, `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing\nreturns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to\nimplement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential\nlogic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full\nAdder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's\nshort-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the\ncarry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also\noutputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not\nphysically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port\nwith an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to\nunexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's\nslow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large\ncomputation with such slow operations speeds. We propose that using spiking\nlogic, either in gates or as neuron-analogues, with plastic rewritable\nconnections between them, would allow the building of a neuromorphic computer.\n",

Here, we overcome this difficulty by\nproposing an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections\nliterally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory.\nThis is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering\nof coherent light in random media. We use this device on a simple task of\nclassification with a kernel machine, and we show that, on the MNIST database,\nthe experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the\ncorresponding kernel. This framework can help make kernel methods practical for\napplications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.\nWe discuss possible extensions of the method in terms of a class of kernels,\nspeed, memory consumption and different problems.\n",

In particular, the\ntransmitter has to be able to control the release of signaling molecules for\nmodulation of the information bits. An important class of control mechanisms in\nnatural cells for releasing molecules is based on ion channels which are\npore-forming proteins across the cell membrane whose opening and closing may be\ncontrolled by a gating parameter. In this paper, a modulator for DMC based on\nion channels is proposed which controls the rate at which molecules are\nreleased from the transmitter by modulating a gating parameter signal.\nExploiting the capabilities of the proposed modulator, an on-off keying\nmodulation scheme is introduced and the corresponding average modulated signal,\ni.e., the average release rate of the molecules from the transmitter, is\nderived in the Laplace domain. By making a simplifying assumption, a\nclosed-form expression for the average modulated signal in the time domain is\nobtained which constitutes an upper bound on the total number of released\nmolecules regardless of this assumption. The derived average modulated signal\nis compared to results obtained with a particle based simulator. The numerical\nresults show that the derived upper bound is tight if the number of ion\nchannels distributed across the transmitter (cell) membrane is small.\n",

Communication via molecular\ndiffusion is a popular strategy that is ubiquitous in nature and very fast over\ndistances on the order of a micron or less. Existing closed-form analysis of\nthe diffusion channel impulse response generally assumes that the transmitter\nis a point source. In this paper, channel impulse responses are derived for\nspherical transmitters with either a passive or absorbing receiver. The derived\nchannel impulse responses are in closed-form for a one-dimensional environment\nand can be found via numerical integration for a three-dimensional environment.\nThe point transmitter assumption (PTA) is formally defined so that its accuracy\ncan be measured in comparison to the derived spherical transmitter impulse\nresponses. The spherical transmitter model is much more accurate than the PTA\nwhen the distance between a transmitter and its receiver is small relative to\nthe size of the transmitter. The derived results are verified via microscopic\nparticle-based simulations using the molecular communication simulation\nplatform AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion).

In contrast to other machine learning (ML) approaches, the structure is\nnot application dependent and relies on fully unsupervised continuous learning.\nWe hypothesize that a hardware implementation will be able not only to extend\nthe already practical uses of these ideas to broader scenarios but also to\nexploit the hardware-friendly CLA characteristics.

Inscribed matter is defined\nas an ensemble of \"tokens\" (molecules, objects, and so on) and is inspired, at\nleast partially, by biological systems where groups of individually constructed\ndiscrete particles ranging from molecules through membrane-bound structures\ncontaining molecules to viruses and organisms are released by a source and\ntravel to a target -- for example, morphogens or semiochemicals diffuse from\none cell, tissue or organism diffuse to another.

We provide capacity bounds for\neach scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not\nunreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at\nfemtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or\nbin-counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, individual token timing\nundergirds all molecular communication techniques. Thus, our modeling and\nresults about the physics of efficient token-based information transfer can\ninform investigations of diverse theoretical and practical problems in\nengineering and biology.

Recently, a deterministic,\ncontinuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nat.Phys. {\\bf 7}(12),\n966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean\nSatisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on\neven the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \\geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost\nthrough exponentially driven auxiliary variables. This paper presents a novel\nanalog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT, implementing the CTDS via incorporating\nnovel, analog circuit design ideas. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a\nco-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications.\nIt is especially effective for solving hard $k$-SAT problem instances that are\nchallenging for algorithms running on digital machines. Furthermore, with its\nmodular design, AC-SAT can readily be extended to solve larger size problems,\nwhile the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of\nvariables and number of clauses.

When propagation and reception processes are considered\nin a framework of first passage processes, we need to focus on absorbing\nreceivers. For this kind of molecular communication system, the characteristics\nof the channel is also affected by the shape of the transmitter. In the\nliterature, most studies focus on systems with a point transmitter due to\ncircular symmetry. In this letter, we address propagation and reception pattern\nfor chemical signals emitted from a spherical transmitter. We also investigate\nthe directivity gain achieved by the reflecting spherical transmitter. We\nquantify the power gain by measuring the received power at different angles on\na circular region. Moreover, we define three metrics, i.e., the half-power\npattern-width, the directivity gain, and the peak time of the signal, for\nanalyzing the received signal pattern.\n",

Vertex coloring of graphs, belonging to\nthe class of combinatorial optimization represents such a problem; and is well\nstudied for its wide spectrum of applications in data sciences, life sciences,\nsocial sciences and engineering and technology. This motivates alternate, and\nmore efficient non-Boolean pathways to their solution. Here, we demonstrate a\ncoupled relaxation oscillator based dynamical system that exploits the\ninsulator-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2), to efficiently solve the\nvertex coloring of graphs. By harnessing the natural analogue between\noptimization, pertinent to graph coloring solutions, and energy minimization\nprocesses in highly parallel, interconnected dynamical systems, we harness the\nphysical manifestation of the latter process to approximate the optimal\ncoloring of k-partite graphs. We further indicate a fundamental connection\nbetween the eigen properties of a linear dynamical system and the spectral\nalgorithms that can solve approximate graph coloring. Our work not only\nelucidates a physics-based computing approach but also presents tantalizing\nopportunities for building customized analog co-processors for solving hard\nproblems efficiently.\n",

It can be realized if time non-locality\n(memory) is present. A practical realization of self-organizing logic gates\n(SOLGs) can be done by combining circuit elements with and without memory. By\nemploying one such realization, we show, numerically, that SOLGs exploit\nelementary instantons to reach equilibrium points. Instantons are classical\ntrajectories of the non-linear equations of motion describing SOLGs, and\nconnect topologically distinct critical points in the phase space. By linear\nanalysis at those points, we show that these instantons connect the initial\ncritical point of the dynamics, with at least one unstable direction, directly\nto the final fixed point. We also show that the memory content of these gates\nonly affects the relaxation time to reach the logically consistent solution.\nFinally, we demonstrate, by solving the corresponding stochastic differential\nequations, that since instantons connect critical points, noise and\nperturbations may change the instanton trajectory in the phase space, but not\nthe initial and final critical points. Therefore, even for extremely large\nnoise levels, the gates self-organize to the correct solution.

        "summary": "  It is well known that physical phenomena may be of great help in computing\nsome difficult problems efficiently. A typical example is prime factorization\nthat may be solved in polynomial time by exploiting quantum entanglement on a\nquantum computer. There are, however, other types of (non-quantum) physical\nproperties that one may leverage to compute efficiently a wide range of hard\nproblems. In this perspective we discuss how to employ one such property,\nmemory (time non-locality), in a novel physics-based approach to computation:\nMemcomputing. In particular, we focus on digital memcomputing machines (DMMs)\nthat are scalable. DMMs can be realized with non-linear dynamical systems with\nmemory. The latter property allows the realization of a new type of Boolean\nlogic, one that is self-organizing. Self-organizing logic gates are\n\"terminal-agnostic\", namely they do not distinguish between input and output\nterminals. When appropriately assembled to represent a given\ncombinatorial/optimization problem, the corresponding self-organizing circuit\nconverges to the equilibrium points that express the solutions of the problem\nat hand. In doing so, DMMs take advantage of the long-range order that develops\nduring the transient dynamics. This collective dynamical behavior, reminiscent\nof a phase transition, or even the \"edge of chaos\", is mediated by families of\nclassical trajectories (instantons) that connect critical points of increasing\nstability in the system's phase space. The topological character of the\nsolution search renders DMMs robust against noise and structural disorder.\nSince DMMs are non-quantum systems described by ordinary differential\nequations, not only can they be built in hardware with available technology,\nthey can also be simulated efficiently on modern classical computers. As an\nexample, we will show the polynomial-time solution of the subset-sum problem\nfor the worst...\n",

However, the existing LCC systems either require cameras directly\nfacing to the lights or can only communicate over a single link, resulting in\nlow throughputs and being fragile to ambient illuminant interference. We\npresent HYCACO, a novel LCC system, which enables multiple light emitting\ndiodes (LEDs) with an unaltered camera to communicate via the non-line-of-sight\n(NLoS) links. Different from other NLoS LCC systems, the proposed scheme is\nresilient to the complex indoor luminous environment. HYCACO can decode the\nmessages by exploring the mixed reflected optical signals transmitted from\nmultiple LEDs. By further exploiting the rolling shutter mechanism, we present\nthe optimal optical frequencies and camera exposure duration selection strategy\nto achieve the best performance. We built a hardware prototype to demonstrate\nthe efficiency of the proposed scheme under different application scenarios.\nThe experimental results show that the system throughput reaches 4.5 kbps on\niPhone 6s with three transmitters.

If a target is present, it\ncontinuously and with a constant rate secretes molecules of a specific type,\nso-called biomarkers, into the medium, which are symptomatic for the presence\nof the target. Detection of these biomarkers is challenging since due to the\ndiffusion and degradation, the biomarkers are only detectable in the vicinity\nof the target. In addition, the exact location of the target within the tissue\nis not known. In this paper, we propose to distribute several reactive\nnanosensors (NSs) across the tissue such that at least some of them are\nexpected to come in contact with biomarkers, which cause them to become\nactivated. Upon activation, an NS releases a certain number of molecules of a\nsecondary type into the medium to alert a fusion center (FC), where the final\ndecision regarding the presence of the target is made. In particular, we\nconsider a composite hypothesis testing framework where it is assumed that the\nlocation of the target and the biomarker secretion rate are unknown, whereas\nthe locations of the NSs are known. We derive the uniformly most powerful (UMP)\ntest for the detection at the NSs. For the final decision at the FC, we show\nthat the UMP test does not exist. Hence, we derive a genie-aided detector as an\nupper bound on performance. We then propose two sub-optimal detectors and\nevaluate their performance via simulations\n",

The conventional Complementary\nMetal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology is limited by the threshold voltage\nand subthreshold leakage problems in scaling of devices. This leads to failure\nin adapting it to sub-micron and nanotechnologies. The carbon nanotube (CNT)\ntechnology overcomes the threshold voltage and subthreshold leakage problems\ndespite reduction in size. The CNT based technology develops the most promising\ndevices among emerging technologies because it has most of the desired\nfeatures. Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) are the novel\ndevices that are expected to sustain the transistor scalability while\nincreasing its performance. Recently, there have been tremendous advances in\nCNT technology for nanoelectronics applications. CNFETs avoid most of the\nfundamental limitations and offer several advantages compared to silicon-based\ntechnology. Though CNT evolves as a better option to overcome some of the bulk\nCMOS problems, the CNT itself still immersed with setbacks. The fabrication of\ncarbon nanotube at very large digital circuits on a single substrate is\ndifficult to achieve. Therefore, a hybrid NP dynamic Carry Look Ahead Adder\n(CLA) is designed using p-CNFET and n-MOS transistors.

Throughout the numerical analysis, a\nsymmetrical $2\\times 2$ MIMO-DBMC system is assumed. Furthermore, a trained\nartificial neural network is utilized to acquire the channel impulse responses.\nThe numerical analysis demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a diversity\ngain in molecular communications.

This model described the motion of a\nboundary, $w$, between two types of inter-converting material,\n$R_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, seemingly under a uniform field\nacross the entire device. In fact, what was intended was a field with a\ndiscontinuity at $w$, that was uniform between $0<x<w$. In this paper we show\nthat the discontinuity is required for the Strukov model derivation to be\ncompleted, and thus the derivation as given does not describe a situation with\na uniform field across the entire device. The discontinuity can be described as\na Heaviside function, $H$, located on $w$, for which there are three common\nsingle-valued approximations for $H(w)$. The Strukov model as intended includes\nan approximation for the Heaviside function (the field is taken to be the same\nas that across the $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ part of the device). We compare\napproximations and give solutions. We then extend the description of the field\nto a more-realistic continuously varying sigmoidal transition between two\nuniform fields and demonstrate that the centro-symmetric approximation model\n(taking the field as being the average of the fields across $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$\nand $R_{\\mathrm{off}}$) is a better single-point model of that situation: the\nother two approximations over or underestimate the field.\n",

These are logic gates and circuits able to accept\ninput signals from any terminal, without distinction between conventional input\nand output terminals. They can solve boolean problems by self-organizing into\ntheir solution. They can be fabricated either with circuit elements with memory\n(such as memristors) and/or standard MOS technology. Using tools of functional\nanalysis, we prove mathematically the following constraints for the\npoly-resource resolvability: i) SOLCs possess a global attractor; ii) their\nonly equilibrium points are the solutions of the problems to solve; iii) the\nsystem converges exponentially fast to the solutions; iv) the equilibrium\nconvergence rate scales at most polynomially with input size. We finally\nprovide arguments that periodic orbits and strange attractors cannot coexist\nwith equilibria.

We first characterize security metrics for a\nbasic building block of the security primitives based on a two layer stack with\nmonolithically integrated 10x10 250-nm half-pitch memristive crossbar circuits.\nThe experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity,\nmeasured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total,\nis close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The\nuniqueness, which was evaluated on a smaller sample by readjusting conductances\nof crosspoint devices within the same crossbar, is also close to the ideal 50%\n+/- 1%, while the smallest bit error rate, i.e. reciprocal of reliability,\nmeasured over 30-day window under +/-20% power supply variations, was ~ 1.5%\n+/- 1%. We then utilize multiple instances of the basic block to demonstrate\nphysically unclonable functional primitive with 10-bit hidden challenge\ngeneration that encodes more than 10^19 challenge response pairs and has\ncomparable uniformity, diffusiveness, and bit error rate.\n",

Bayesian models have been proposed to face\nthis challenge. Indeed, Bayesian inference is a way to do optimal reasoning\nwhen only uncertain and incomplete information is available. Various\nperceptive, sensory-motor, and cognitive functions have been successfully\nmodeled this way. However, the biological mechanisms allowing animals and\nhumans to represent and to compute probability distributions are not known. It\nhas been proposed that neurons and assemblies of neurons could be the\nappropriate scale to search for clues to probabilistic reasoning. In contrast,\nin this paper, we propose that interacting populations of macromolecules and\ndiffusible messengers can perform probabilistic computation. This suggests that\nprobabilistic reasoning, based on cellular signaling pathways, is a fundamental\nskill of living organisms available to the simplest unicellular organisms as\nwell as the most complex brains.\n",

One of the main challenges with such systems\nis the limited control the transmitter has on the concentration level at the\nreceiver. For example, concentration cannot be directly decreased by the\ntransmitter, and the decrease in concentration over time occurs solely due to\ntransport mechanisms such as diffusion. This can result in inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI), which can have degrading effects on performance. In this\nwork, a new and novel scheme is proposed that uses the transmission of acids,\nbases, and the concentration of hydrogen ions for carrying information. By\nemploying this technique, the concentration of hydrogen ions at the receiver\ncan be both increased and decreased through the sender's transmissions. This\nenables novel ISI mitigation schemes as well as the possibility to form a wider\narray of signal patterns at the receiver.\n",

Its building blocks can be fabricated in hardware with standard\nelectronic circuits, thus offering a path to its practical realization. In\naddition, since memcomputing is based on non-quantum elements, the equations of\nmotion describing these machines can be simulated efficiently on standard\ncomputers. In fact, it was recently realized that memcomputing, and in\nparticular its digital (hence scalable) version, when simulated on a classical\nmachine provides a significant speed-up over state-of-the-art algorithms on a\nvariety of non-convex problems. Here, we stress-test the capabilities of this\napproach on finding approximate solutions to hard combinatorial optimization\nproblems.

We\nrecently showed that in a region where state of the art algorithms demonstrate\nthis exponential growth, simulations of digital memcomputing machines performed\nusing the Falcon$^\\copyright$ simulator of MemComputing, Inc. only require time\nand memory resources that scale linearly. These results are extended in a\nstress-test up to $64\\times10^6$ variables (corresponding to about 1 billion\nliterals), namely the largest case that we could fit on a single node with 128\nGB of DRAM.

Here, we propose to\nreplicate the kernel matrix of a convolution layer on distinct analog arrays,\nand randomly divide parts of the compute among them, so that multiple kernel\nmatrices are trained in parallel.

Based on this finding, we propose an attack scheme called\nprobabilistic SAT (PSAT) which can bypass the defense offered by logic locking\nand camouflaging for imprecise computing schemes. Further, we illustrate how\ncareful application of our GSHE primitive can remain secure even on the\napplication of the PSAT attack. Finally, we also discuss side-channel attacks\nand invasive monitoring, which are arguably even more concerning threats than\nSAT attacks.\n",

        "summary": "  Ising computing provides a new computing paradigm for many hard combinatorial\noptimization problems. Ising computing essentially tries to solve the quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problem, which is also described by the Ising\nspin glass model and is also the basis for so-called Quantum Annealing\ncomputers. In this work, we propose a novel General Purpose Graphics Processing\nUnit (GPGPU) solver for the balanced min-cut graph partitioning problem, which\nhas many applications in the area of design automation and others. Ising model\nsolvers for the balanced min-cut partitioning problem have been proposed in the\npast. However, they have rarely been demonstrated in existing quantum computers\nfor many meaningful problem sizes. One difficulty is the fact that the\nbalancing constraint in the balanced min-cut problem can result in a complete\ngraph in the Ising model, which makes each local update a global update. Such\nglobal update from each GPU thread will diminish the efficiency of GPU\ncomputing, which favors many localized memory accesses for each thread. To\nmitigate this problem, we propose an novel Global Decoupled Ising (GDI) model\nand the corresponding annealing algorithm, in which the local update is still\npreserved to maintain the efficiency. As a result, the new Ising solver\nessentially eliminates the need for the fully connected graph and will use a\nmore efficient method to track and update global balance without sacrificing\ncut quality. Experimental results show that the proposed Ising-based min-cut\npartitioning method outperforms the state of art partitioning tool, METIS, on\nG-set graph benchmarks in terms of partitioning quality with similar CPU/GPU\ntimes.\n",

Our detailed simulations have shown that, for example, the 5-bit VMM of\n200-element vectors, using the commercially available 64-layer gate-all-around\nmacaroni-type 3D-NAND memory blocks designed in the 55-nm technology node, may\nprovide an unprecedented area efficiency of 0.14 um2/byte and energy efficiency\nof ~10 fJ/Op, including the input/output and other peripheral circuitry\noverheads. Our second major contribution is the development of 3D-aCortex, a\nmulti-purpose neuromorphic inference processor that utilizes the proposed\n3D-VMM blocks as its core processing units. We have performed rigorous\nperformance simulations of such a processor on both circuit and system levels,\ntaking into account non-idealities such as drain-induced barrier lowering,\ncapacitive coupling, charge injection, parasitics, process variations, and\nnoise. Our modeling of the 3D-aCortex performing several state-of-the-art\nneuromorphic-network benchmarks has shown that it may provide the\nrecord-breaking storage efficiency of 4.34 MB/mm2, the peak energy efficiency\nof 70.43 TOps/J, and the computational throughput up to 10.66 TOps/s. The\nstorage efficiency can be further improved seven-fold by aggressively sharing\nVMM peripheral circuits at the cost of slight decrease in energy efficiency and\nthroughput.\n",

Solutions of many hard problems\nhave been reported by numerically integrating the ODEs of DMMs, showing\nsubstantial advantages over state-of-the-art solvers. To investigate the\nreasons behind the robustness and effectiveness of this method, we employ three\nexplicit integration schemes (forward Euler, trapezoid and Runge-Kutta 4th\norder) with a constant time step, to solve 3-SAT instances with planted\nsolutions. We show that, (i) even if most of the trajectories in the phase\nspace are destroyed by numerical noise, the solution can still be achieved;\n(ii) the forward Euler method, although having the largest numerical error,\nsolves the instances in the least amount of function evaluations; and (iii)\nwhen increasing the integration time step, the system undergoes a\n\"solvable-unsolvable transition\" at a critical threshold, which needs to decay\nat most as a power law with the problem size, to control the numerical errors.\nTo explain these results, we model the dynamical behavior of DMMs as directed\npercolation of the state trajectory in the phase space in the presence of\nnoise.

Receiver saturation renders\nthe system behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly\nneglected in existing analytical models. Furthermore, due to the ligands'\ncompetition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual binding events at\nthe molecular receiver are in general statistically dependent and the binomial\nmodel for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. In this work,\nwe propose a novel deterministic model for receptor saturation in terms of a\nstate-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion of Fick's diffusion\nequation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally\nefficient. Employing the proposed deterministic model, we show that saturation\nat the molecular receiver reduces the peak-value of the expected received\nsignal and accelerates the clearance of NTs as compared to the case when\nreceptor occupancy is neglected. We further derive a statistical model for the\nreceived signal in terms of the hypergeometric distribution which accounts for\nthe competition of NTs for receptors and the competition of receptors for NTs.\nThe proposed statistical model reveals how the signal statistics are shaped by\nthe number of released NTs, the number of receptors, and the binding kinetics\nof the receptors, respectively, in the presence of competition. We show that\nthe impact of these parameters on the signal variance depends on the relative\nnumbers of NTs and receptors.

Our\nframework reduces laser and tuning-power overhead while intelligently\napproximating communication, such that application output quality is not\ndistorted beyond an acceptable limit. Simulation results show that our\nframework can achieve up to 56.4% lower laser power consumption and up to 23.8%\nbetter energy-efficiency than the best-known prior work on approximate\ncommunication with silicon photonic interconnects and for the same application\noutput quality.\n",

In\nthis regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their\nunique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential,\ndurability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog\nstorage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further\nimproving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display\nstrong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more\nchallenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To\naddress this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming\nstrategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like\ncompliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage\namplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for\ntuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating\ndigital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters\nfixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like\ncompliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results,\nwith and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory\narray of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is\npossible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array\nlevel, verified 1000 seconds after programming.\n",

In this work, we focus on a\ndiffusion-based communication system where the reception process is an\nabsorption via receptors. Whenever a molecule hits to the receiver it is\nremoved from the environment. This kind of reception process is called first\npassage process and it is more complicated compared to diffusion process only.\nIn 3-D environments, obtaining analytical solution for hitting time\ndistribution for realistic cases is complicated, hence we develop an end-to-end\nsimulator for he diffusion-based communication system that sends consecutive\nsymbols.\n  In CvD, each symbol is modulated and demodulated in a time slot called symbol\nduration, however the long tail distribution of hitting time is the main\nchallenge that affects the symbol detection error. The molecules arriving in\nthe following slots become an interference source when detection takes place.\nEnd-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol\ninterference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI\ncancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the\neffect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are\nconsidered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves.

Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes\nformed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,\nwe used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such\ncommunication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules\nthat a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the\nnumber of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls\nwith distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.\nIn order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a\nmolecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the\ndifferent or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the\ntransmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the\nrelay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the\nreceiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type\nof molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of\nconcentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number\nof bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying,\nwe obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that\nmulti-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying. In the\nsecond scenario, we study the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary\nsignaling scheme. We show that this relaying strategy increases the reliability\nof M-ary communication significantly.\n",

        "summary": "  Molecular communication is a new field of communication where molecules are\nused to transfer information. Among the proposed methods, molecular\ncommunication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective. One of the main\nchallenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits\ncommunication at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy\nefficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a\npre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a\ndecision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the\noptimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally\ncalculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD\nsystem suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,\nnew modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of\nISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a\nmodulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is\nproposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.\nFurthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes\nthe residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a\nnew energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute\nfor the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision\nfeedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are\ncompared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more\nadvantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower\ncomputational complexity.\n",

These non-idealities can lead to errors in\nVMMs, eventually degrading the DNN's accuracy. It is therefore critical to\nstudy the impact of crossbar non-idealities on the accuracy of large-scale\nDNNs.

First, probabilistic spin logic\ndevices are used to develop an RBM realization which is adapted to construct\ndeep belief networks (DBNs) having one to three hidden layers of size 10 to 800\nneurons each. Second, we design a hardware implementation for the contrastive\ndivergence (CD) algorithm using a four-state finite state machine capable of\nunsupervised training in N+3 clocks where N denotes the number of neurons in\neach RBM. The functionality of our proposed CD hardware implementation is\nvalidated using ModelSim simulations. We synthesize the developed Verilog HDL\nimplementation of our proposed test/train control circuitry for various DBN\ntopologies where the maximal RBM dimensions yield resource utilization ranging\nfrom 51 to 2,421 lookup tables (LUTs). Next, we leverage spin Hall effect\n(SHE)-magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based non-volatile LUTs circuits as an\nalternative for static random access memory (SRAM)-based LUTs storing the\ndeterministic logic configuration to form a reconfigurable fabric. Finally, we\ncompare the performance of our proposed SNRA with SRAM-based configurable\nfabrics focusing on the area and power consumption induced by the LUTs used to\nimplement both CD and evaluation modes. The results obtained indicate more than\n80% reduction in combined dynamic and static power dissipation, while achieving\nat least 50% reduction in device count.\n",

While the resulting machines have demonstrated in some cases even\nsuper-human performance, their energy consumption has often proved to be\nprohibitive in the absence of costly super-computers. Most state-of-the-art\nmachine learning solutions are based on memory-less models of neurons. This is\nunlike the neurons in the human brain, which encode and process information\nusing temporal information in spike events. The different computing principles\nunderlying biological neurons and how they combine together to efficiently\nprocess information is believed to be a key factor behind their superior\nefficiency compared to current machine learning systems. Inspired by the\ntime-encoding mechanism used by the brain, third generation spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) are being studied for building a new class of information\nprocessing engines.\n  Modern computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture, however, are\nill-suited for efficiently implementing SNNs, since their performance is\nlimited by the need to constantly shuttle data between physically separated\nlogic and memory units. Hence, novel computational architectures that address\nthe von Neumann bottleneck are necessary in order to build systems that can\nimplement SNNs with low energy budgets.

The architecture of this probabilistic\ncomputer is similar to a stochastic neural network with the p-bit playing the\nrole of a binary stochastic neuron, but with one key difference: there is no\nsequencer used to enforce an ordering of p-bit updates, as is typically\nrequired. Instead, we explore \\textit{sequencerless} designs where all p-bits\nare allowed to flip autonomously and demonstrate that such designs can allow\nultrafast operation unconstrained by available clock speeds without\ncompromising the solution's fidelity. Based on experimental results from a\nhardware benchmark of the autonomous design and benchmarked device models, we\nproject that a nanomagnetic implementation can scale to achieve petaflips per\nsecond with millions of neurons. A key contribution of this paper is the focus\non a hardware metric $-$ flips per second $-$ as a problem and\nsubstrate-independent figure-of-merit for an emerging class of hardware\nannealers known as Ising Machines.

This new cell structure,\nreferred to as flash threshold logic (FTL), uses floating gate (flash)\ntransistors to realize the weights associated with a threshold function. The\nthreshold voltages of the flash transistors serve as a proxy for the weights.\nAn FTL cell can be equivalently viewed as a multi-input, edge-triggered\nflipflop which computes a threshold function on a clock edge. Consequently, it\ncan be used in the automatic synthesis of ASICs. The use of flash transistors\nin the FTL cell allows programming of the weights after fabrication, thereby\npreventing discovery of its function by a foundry or by reverse engineering.\nThis paper focuses on the design and characteristics of the FTL cell. We\npresent a novel method for programming the weights of an FTL cell for a\nspecified threshold function using a modified perceptron learning algorithm.\nThe algorithm is further extended to select weights to maximize the robustness\nof the design in the presence of process variations. The FTL circuit was\ndesigned in 40nm technology and simulations with layout-extracted parasitics\nincluded, demonstrate significant improvements in the area (79.7%), power\n(61.1%), and performance (42.5%) when compared to the equivalent\nimplementations of the same function in conventional static CMOS design.

Although photonic reservoir computing provides superior performance\nin environments whose characteristics are coincident with the training datasets\nfor the reservoir, the performance is significantly degraded if these\ncharacteristics deviate from the original knowledge used in the training phase.\nHere, we propose a scheme of adaptive model selection in photonic reservoir\ncomputing using reinforcement learning. In this scheme, a temporal waveform is\ngenerated by different dynamic source models that change over time. The system\nautonomously identifies the best source model for the task of time series\nprediction using photonic reservoir computing and reinforcement learning. We\nprepare two types of output weights for the source models, and the system\nadaptively selected the correct model using reinforcement learning, where the\nprediction errors are associated with rewards. We succeed in adaptive model\nselection when the source signal is temporally mixed, having originally been\ngenerated by two different dynamic system models, as well as when the signal is\na mixture from the same model but with different parameter values. This study\npaves the way for autonomous behavior in photonic artificial intelligence and\ncould lead to new applications in load forecasting and multi-objective control,\nwhere frequent environment changes are expected.\n",

Independent maximum likelihood\nestimation is also considered at each RX as a benchmark to show the performance\nadvantage of DE.

It introduces the notion of a logic of the mind, where\nneurophysiological data are encoded as logical expressions representing mental\nactivity. Effective logical expressions are likely to be extensive, involving\ndozens of variables. Large expressions require considerable computational power\nto be processed. This is problematic for BCI applications because they require\nfast reaction times to execute sequences of commands. Quantum computers hold\nmuch promise in terms of processing speed for some problems, including those\ninvolving logical expressions. Hence, we propose to use quantum computers to\nprocess the logic of the mind. The chapter begins with an introduction to BCI\nand the electroencephalogram, which is the neurophysiological signal that is\nnormally used in BCI. Then, it briefly discusses how the EEG corresponds to\nmental states, followed by an introduction to the logic of the mind. After\nthat, there is an overview of quantum computing, focusing on the basics deemed\nnecessary to understand how it processes logical expressions. An example of a\nBCI system is presented. In a nutshell, the system reads the EEG and builds\nlogical expressions, which are sent to a quantum computer to solve them. In\nturn, the system converts the results into sounds by means of a bespoke\nsynthesiser. Essentially, the BCI here is a musical instrument controlled by\nthe mind of the player.

        "summary": "  In this paper, a hardware-optimized approach to emotion recognition based on\nthe efficient brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) paradigm is\nproposed. Emotion recognition provides valuable information for human-computer\ninteractions, however the large number of input channels (>200) and modalities\n(>3) involved in emotion recognition are significantly expensive from a memory\nperspective. To address this, methods for memory reduction and optimization are\nproposed, including a novel approach that takes advantage of the combinatorial\nnature of the encoding process, and an elementary cellular automaton. HDC with\nearly sensor fusion is implemented alongside the proposed techniques achieving\ntwo-class multi-modal classification accuracies of >76% for valence and >73%\nfor arousal on the multi-modal AMIGOS and DEAP datasets, almost always better\nthan state of the art. The required vector storage is seamlessly reduced by 98%\nand the frequency of vector requests by at least 1/5. The results demonstrate\nthe potential of efficient hyperdimensional computing for low-power,\nmulti-channeled emotion recognition tasks.\n",

In the Von Neumann architecture, processing and memory\nunits are implemented as separate blocks interchanging data intensively and\ncontinuously. This data transfer is responsible for a large part of the power\nconsumption. The next generation computer technology is expected to solve\nproblems at the exascale with 1018 calculations each second. Even though these\nfuture computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are based on von Neumann\ntype architectures, they will consume between 20 and 30 megawatts of power and\nwill not have intrinsic physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal with\ncomplex data as our brain does. These needs can be addressed by neuromorphic\ncomputing systems which are inspired by the biological concepts of the human\nbrain. This new generation of computers has the potential to be used for the\nstorage and processing of large amounts of digital information with much lower\npower consumption than conventional processors. Among their potential future\napplications, an important niche is moving the control from data centers to\nedge devices.\n  The aim of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of\nneuromorphic technology and provide an opinion on the challenges and\nopportunities that the future holds in the major areas of neuromorphic\ntechnology, namely materials, devices, neuromorphic circuits, neuromorphic\nalgorithms, applications, and ethics. The Roadmap is a collection of\nperspectives where leading researchers in the neuromorphic community provide\ntheir own view about the current state and the future challenges.

The quality of the fixed\nnetwork, called reservoir, is the most important factor that determines the\nperformance of the RC system. In this paper, we investigate the influence of\nthe hierarchical reservoir structure on the properties of the reservoir and the\nperformance of the RC system. Analogous to deep neural networks, stacking\nsub-reservoirs in series is an efficient way to enhance the nonlinearity of\ndata transformation to high-dimensional space and expand the diversity of\ntemporal information captured by the reservoir. These deep reservoir systems\noffer better performance when compared to simply increasing the size of the\nreservoir or the number of sub-reservoirs. Low frequency components are mainly\ncaptured by the sub-reservoirs in later stage of the deep reservoir structure,\nsimilar to observations that more abstract information can be extracted by\nlayers in the late stage of deep neural networks. When the total size of the\nreservoir is fixed, tradeoff between the number of sub-reservoirs and the size\nof each sub-reservoir needs to be carefully considered, due to the degraded\nability of individual sub-reservoirs at small sizes. Improved performance of\nthe deep reservoir structure alleviates the difficulty of implementing the RC\nsystem on hardware systems.\n",

Several studies introduced\nDNA based storage systems with high information density (petabytes/gram).\nHowever, DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies yield erroneous outputs.\nAlgorithmic approaches for correcting these errors depend on reading multiple\ncopies of each sequence and result in excessive reading costs. The\nunprecedented success of Transformers as a deep learning architecture for\nlanguage modeling has led to its repurposing for solving a variety of tasks\nacross various domains.

Our approach exploits the\ninherent redundancy of each decoded file to learn its underlying structure. To\ndemonstrate our proposed approach, we encode text, image and code-script files\nto DNA, produce errors with high-fidelity error simulator, and reconstruct the\noriginal files from the noisy reads. Our model achieves lower error rates when\nreconstructing the original data from a single read of each DNA strand compared\nto state-of-the-art algorithms using 2-3 copies.

However, achieving high\nmemory fidelity incurs significant write-energy costs, which should be reduced\nfor large-scale deployment of MRAMs. In this paper, we formulate a\n\\emph{biconvex} optimization problem to optimize write fidelity given energy\nand latency constraints. The basic idea is to allocate non-uniform write pulses\ndepending on the importance of each bit position. The fidelity measure we\nconsider is mean squared error (MSE), for which we optimize write pulses via\n\\emph{alternating convex search (ACS)}. By using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\nconditions, we derive analytic solutions and propose an \\emph{iterative\nwater-filling-type} algorithm by leveraging the analytic solutions. Hence, the\nproposed iterative water-filling algorithm is computationally more efficient\nthan the original ACS while their solutions are identical. Although the\noriginal ACS and the proposed iterative water-filling algorithm do not\nguarantee global optimality, the MSEs obtained by the proposed algorithm are\ncomparable to the MSEs by complicated global nonlinear programming solvers.\nFurthermore, we prove that the proposed algorithm can reduce the MSE\nexponentially with the number of bits per word. For an 8-bit accessed word, the\nproposed algorithm reduces the MSE by a factor of 21. We also evaluate the\nproposed algorithm for MNIST dataset classification supposing that the model\nparameters of deep neural networks are stored in MRAMs. The numerical results\nshow that the optimized write pulses can achieve \\SI{40}{\\%} write energy\nreduction for a given classification accuracy.\n",

We\ncan easily represent multi-attribute data more compactly on a classical\ncomputer by replacing one-hot encoding with label encoding. However, replacing\nthese encoding schemes on a QC is not straightforward as PQM and P-PQM operate\nat the quantum bit level.\n  We present an enhanced P-PQM, called EP-PQM, that allows label encoding of\ndata stored in a PQM data structure and reduces the circuit depth of the data\nstorage and retrieval procedures. We show implementations for an ideal QC and a\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device.\n  Our complexity analysis shows that the EP-PQM approach requires $O\\left(z\n\\log_2(a)\\right)$ qubits as opposed to $O(za)$ qubits for P-PQM. EP-PQM also\nrequires fewer gates, reducing gate count from $O\\left(rza\\right)$ to\n$O\\left(rz\\log_2(a)\\right)$.\n  For five datasets, we demonstrate that training an ML classification model\nusing EP-PQM requires 48% to 77% fewer qubits than P-PQM for datasets with\n$a>2$. EP-PQM reduces circuit depth in the range of 60% to 96%, depending on\nthe dataset. The depth decreases further with a decomposed circuit, ranging\nbetween 94% and 99%.\n  EP-PQM requires less space; thus, it can train on and classify larger\ndatasets than previous PQM implementations on NISQ devices. Furthermore,\nreducing the number of gates speeds up the classification and reduces the noise\nassociated with deep quantum circuits. Thus, EP-PQM brings us closer to\nscalable ML on a NISQ device.\n",

Memory augmented neural\nnetwork has been proposed to achieve the goal, but the memory module has to be\nstored in an off-chip memory due to its size. Therefore the practical use has\nbeen heavily limited. Previous works on emerging memory-based implementation\nhave difficulties in scaling up because different modules with various\nstructures are difficult to integrate on the same chip and the small sense\nmargin of the content addressable memory for the memory module heavily limited\nthe degree of mismatch calculation. In this work, we implement the entire\nmemory augmented neural network architecture in a fully integrated memristive\ncrossbar platform and achieve an accuracy that closely matches standard\nsoftware on digital hardware for the Omniglot dataset. The successful\ndemonstration is supported by implementing new functions in crossbars in\naddition to widely reported matrix multiplications. For example, the\nlocality-sensitive hashing operation is implemented in crossbar arrays by\nexploiting the intrinsic stochasticity of memristor devices. Besides, the\ncontent-addressable memory module is realized in crossbars, which also supports\nthe degree of mismatches. Simulations based on experimentally validated models\nshow such an implementation can be efficiently scaled up for one-shot learning\non the Mini-ImageNet dataset.

However, existing architectures can only handle data with regular\nstructures, e.g., images or videos, but fail to generalize to graph-structured\ndata beyond Euclidean space, e.g., social networks or document co-citation\nnetworks. Here, we propose an all-optical graph representation learning\narchitecture, termed diffractive graph neural network (DGNN), based on the\nintegrated diffractive photonic computing units (DPUs) to address this\nlimitation. Specifically, DGNN optically encodes node attributes into strip\noptical waveguides, which are transformed by DPUs and aggregated by on-chip\noptical couplers to extract their feature representations. Each DPU comprises\nsuccessive passive layers of metalines to modulate the electromagnetic optical\nfield via diffraction, where the metaline structures are learnable parameters\nshared across graph nodes. DGNN captures complex dependencies among the node\nneighborhoods and eliminates the nonlinear transition functions during the\nlight-speed optical message passing over graph structures. We demonstrate the\nuse of DGNN extracted features for node and graph-level classification tasks\nwith benchmark databases and achieve superior performance.

While the technology is evolving rapidly,\nthe prohibitive cost of reads and writes, the high frequency and the peculiar\nnature of errors occurring in DNA storage pose a significant challenge to its\nadoption. In this work we make a novel observation that the probability of\nsuccessful recovery of a given bit from any type of a DNA-based storage system\nhighly depends on its physical location within the DNA molecule. In other\nwords, when used as a storage medium, some parts of DNA molecules appear\nsignificantly more reliable than others. We show that large differences in\nreliability between different parts of DNA molecules lead to highly inefficient\nuse of error-correction resources, and that commonly used techniques such as\nunequal error-correction cannot be used to bridge the reliability gap between\ndifferent locations in the context of DNA storage. We then propose two\napproaches to address the problem. The first approach is general and applies to\nany types of data; it stripes the data and ECC codewords across DNA molecules\nin a particular fashion such that the effects of errors are spread out evenly\nacross different codewords and molecules, effectively de-biasing the underlying\nstorage medium. The second approach is application-specific, and seeks to\nleverage the underlying reliability bias by using application-aware mapping of\ndata onto DNA molecules such that data that requires higher reliability is\nstored in more reliable locations, whereas data that needs lower reliability is\nstored in less reliable parts of DNA molecules. We show that the proposed data\nmapping can be used to achieve graceful degradation in the presence of high\nerror rates, or to implement the concept of approximate storage in DNA.\n",

To read (and write) data DNA storage\nexploits technology that has been developed over decades to sequence naturally\noccurring DNA in the life sciences. To achieve higher accuracy for previously\nunseen, biological DNA, sequencing relies on extending and training deep\nmachine learning models known as basecallers. This growth in model complexity\nrequires substantial resources, both computational and data sets. It also\neliminates the possibility of a compact read head for DNA as a storage medium.\n  We argue that we need to depart from blindly using sequencing models from the\nlife sciences for DNA data storage. The difference is striking: for life\nscience applications we have no control over the DNA, however, in the case of\nDNA data storage, we control how it is written, as well as the particular write\nhead. More specifically, data-carrying DNA can be modulated and embedded with\nalignment markers and error correcting codes to guarantee higher fidelity and\nto carry out some of the work that the machine learning models perform.\n  In this paper, we study accuracy trade-offs between deep model size and error\ncorrecting codes. We show that, starting with a model size of 107MB, the\nreduced accuracy from model compression can be compensated by using simple\nerror correcting codes in the DNA sequences. In our experiments, we show that a\nsubstantial reduction in the size of the model does not incur an undue penalty\nfor the error correcting codes used, therefore paving the way for portable\ndata-carrying DNA read head. Crucially, we show that through the joint use of\nmodel compression and error correcting codes, we achieve a higher read accuracy\nthan without compression and error correction codes.\n",

Nonetheless, to\ndemonstrate a practical on-chip memristor-based system, it is essential to have\nthe ability to apply large programming voltage ranges during the\ncharacterisation procedures for various memristor technologies. This work\npresents a 16x16 high voltage memristor characterisation array employing high\nvoltage CMOS circuitry. The proposed system has a maximum programming range of\n$\\pm22V$ to allow on-chip electroforming and I-V sweep. In addition, a Kelvin\nvoltage sensing system is implemented to improve the readout accuracy for low\nmemristance measurements. This work addresses the limitation of conventional\nCMOS-memristor platforms which can only operate at low voltages, thus limiting\nthe characterisation range and integration options of memristor technologies.\n",

        "summary": "  Neural networks are widely deployed models across many scientific disciplines\nand commercial endeavors ranging from edge computing and sensing to large-scale\nsignal processing in data centers. The most efficient and well-entrenched\nmethod to train such networks is backpropagation, or reverse-mode automatic\ndifferentiation. To counter an exponentially increasing energy budget in the\nartificial intelligence sector, there has been recent interest in analog\nimplementations of neural networks, specifically nanophotonic neural networks\nfor which no analog backpropagation demonstration exists. We design\nmass-manufacturable silicon photonic neural networks that alternately cascade\nour custom designed \"photonic mesh\" accelerator with digitally implemented\nnonlinearities. These reconfigurable photonic meshes program computationally\nintensive arbitrary matrix multiplication by setting physical voltages that\ntune the interference of optically encoded input data propagating through\nintegrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks. Here, using our packaged\nphotonic chip, we demonstrate in situ backpropagation for the first time to\nsolve classification tasks and evaluate a new protocol to keep the entire\ngradient measurement and update of physical device voltages in the analog\ndomain, improving on past theoretical proposals. Our method is made possible by\nintroducing three changes to typical photonic meshes: (1) measurements at\noptical \"grating tap\" monitors, (2) bidirectional optical signal propagation\nautomated by fiber switch, and (3) universal generation and readout of optical\namplitude and phase. After training, our classification achieves accuracies\nsimilar to digital equivalents even in presence of systematic error. Our\nfindings suggest a new training paradigm for photonics-accelerated artificial\nintelligence based entirely on a physical analog of the popular backpropagation\ntechnique.\n",

Photonic cryptographic hash functions, which use photonic integrated\ncircuits to accelerate computation, promise energy efficiency for verifying\ntransactions and mining in a cryptonetwork. Like many analog computing\napproaches, however, current proposals for photonic cryptographic hash\nfunctions that promise similar security guarantees as Bitcoin are susceptible\nto systematic error, so multiple devices may not reach a consensus on\ncomputation despite high numerical precision (associated with low photodetector\nnoise). In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that a\nmore general family of robust discrete analog cryptographic hash functions,\nwhich we introduce as LightHash, leverages integer matrix-vector operations on\nphotonic mesh networks of interferometers. The difficulty of LightHash can be\nadjusted to be sufficiently tolerant to systematic error (calibration error,\nloss error, coupling error, and phase error) and preserve inherent security\nguarantees present in the Bitcoin protocol. Finally, going beyond our\nproof-of-concept, we define a ``photonic advantage'' criterion and justify how\nrecent developments in CMOS optoelectronics (including analog-digital\nconversion) provably achieve such advantage for robust and digitally-verifiable\nphotonic computing and ultimately generate a new market for decentralized\nphotonic technology.\n",

Reinforcement learning is\nan important branch of machine learning, and photonic decision-making\nprinciples have been demonstrated with respect to the multi-armed bandit\nproblems. However, reinforcement learning could involve a massive number of\nstates, unlike previously demonstrated bandit problems where the number of\nstates is only one. Q-learning is a well-known approach in reinforcement\nlearning that can deal with many states. The architecture of Q-learning,\nhowever, does not fit well photonic implementations due to its separation of\nupdate rule and the action selection. In this study, we organize a new\narchitecture for multi-state reinforcement learning as a parallel array of\nbandit problems in order to benefit from photonic decision-makers, which we\ncall parallel bandit architecture for reinforcement learning or PBRL in short.\nTaking a cart-pole balancing problem as an instance, we demonstrate that PBRL\nadapts to the environment in fewer time steps than Q-learning. Furthermore,\nPBRL yields faster adaptation when operated with a chaotic laser time series\nthan the case with uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers where the\nautocorrelation inherent in the laser chaos provides a positive effect.

In addition, the\ndistributed sensors, energy generators and storage devices, and networking have\nled to a huge increase in attack vectors that make the grid vulnerable to a\nvariety of attacks. The interconnection between computational and physical\ncomponents through a largely open, IP-based communication network enables an\nattacker to cause physical damage through remote cyber-attacks or attack on\nsoftware-controlled grid operations via physical- or cyber-attacks. Transactive\nEnergy (TE) is an emerging approach for managing increasing DERs in the\nsmart-grids through economic and control techniques. Transactive Smart-Grids\nuse the TE approach to improve grid reliability and efficiency. However,\nskepticism remains in their full-scale viability for ensuring grid reliability.\nIn addition, different TE approaches, in specific situations, can lead to very\ndifferent outcomes in grid operations.

In this paper, we propose a novel low-latency\nparallel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that has between\n2-2,800x fewer network parameters compared to SOTA CNN architectures and\nachieves 5-fold cross validation accuracy of 99.84% for epileptic seizure\ndetection, and 99.01% and 97.54% for epileptic seizure prediction, when\nevaluated using the University of Bonn Electroencephalogram (EEG), CHB-MIT and\nSWEC-ETHZ seizure datasets, respectively. We subsequently implement our network\nonto analog crossbar arrays comprising Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)\ndevices, and provide a comprehensive benchmark by simulating, laying out, and\ndetermining hardware requirements of the CNN component of our system. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to parallelize the execution of\nconvolution layer kernels on separate analog crossbars to enable 2 orders of\nmagnitude reduction in latency compared to SOTA hybrid Memristive-CMOS DL\naccelerators.

        "summary": "  Integrated photonic neural networks (IPNNs) are emerging as promising\nsuccessors to conventional electronic AI accelerators as they offer substantial\nimprovements in computing speed and energy efficiency. In particular, coherent\nIPNNs use arrays of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) for unitary\ntransformations to perform energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplication.\nHowever, the underlying MZI devices in IPNNs are susceptible to uncertainties\nstemming from optical lithographic variations and thermal crosstalk and can\nexperience imprecisions due to non-uniform MZI insertion loss and quantization\nerrors due to low-precision encoding in the tuned phase angles. In this paper,\nwe, for the first time, systematically characterize the impact of such\nuncertainties and imprecisions (together referred to as imperfections) in IPNNs\nusing a bottom-up approach. We show that their impact on IPNN accuracy can vary\nwidely based on the tuned parameters (e.g., phase angles) of the affected\ncomponents, their physical location, and the nature and distribution of the\nimperfections. To improve reliability measures, we identify critical IPNN\nbuilding blocks that, under imperfections, can lead to catastrophic degradation\nin the classification accuracy. We show that under multiple simultaneous\nimperfections, the IPNN inferencing accuracy can degrade by up to 46%, even\nwhen the imperfection parameters are restricted within a small range. Our\nresults also indicate that the inferencing accuracy is sensitive to\nimperfections affecting the MZIs in the linear layers next to the input layer\nof the IPNN.\n",

Nonetheless, when the scale of a\nphotonic circuit increases, the effects of noise on the fidelity of quantum\noperators and deep learning weight matrices become more severe. Here we\ndemonstrate a nontrivial stochastic nature of large-scale programmable photonic\ncircuits-heavy-tailed distributions of rotation operators-that enables the\ndevelopment of high-fidelity universal unitaries through designed pruning of\nsuperfluous rotations. The power law and the Pareto principle for the\nconventional architecture of programmable photonic circuits are revealed with\nthe presence of hub phase shifters, allowing for the application of network\npruning to the design of photonic hardware. We extract a universal architecture\nfor pruning random unitary matrices and prove that \"the bad is sometimes better\nto be removed\" to achieve high fidelity and energy efficiency.

However, costly numerical\nsimulation significantly hinders the scalability and turn-around time in the\nphotonic circuit design loop. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have\nbeen proposed to predict the optical field solution of a single instance of a\npartial differential equation (PDE) with predefined parameters. Their\ncomplicated PDE formulation and lack of efficient parametrization mechanisms\nlimit their flexibility and generalization in practical simulation scenarios.\nIn this work, for the first time, a physics-agnostic neural operator-based\nframework, dubbed NeurOLight, is proposed to learn a family of frequency-domain\nMaxwell PDEs for ultra-fast parametric photonic device simulation. We balance\nthe efficiency and generalization of NeurOLight via several novel techniques.\nSpecifically, we discretize different devices into a unified domain, represent\nparametric PDEs with a compact wave prior, and encode the incident light via\nmasked source modeling. We design our model with parameter-efficient\ncross-shaped NeurOLight blocks and adopt superposition-based augmentation for\ndata-efficient learning. With these synergistic approaches, NeurOLight\ngeneralizes to a large space of unseen simulation settings, demonstrates\n2-orders-of-magnitude faster simulation speed than numerical solvers, and\noutperforms prior neural network models by ~54% lower prediction error with\n~44% fewer parameters.

Such\nThermodynamic AI algorithms are currently run on digital hardware, ultimately\nlimiting their scalability and overall potential. Stochastic fluctuations\nnaturally occur in physical thermodynamic systems, and such fluctuations can be\nviewed as a computational resource. Hence, we propose a novel computing\nparadigm, where software and hardware become inseparable. Our algorithmic\nunification allows us to identify a single full-stack paradigm, involving\nThermodynamic AI hardware, that could accelerate such algorithms. We contrast\nThermodynamic AI hardware with quantum computing where noise is a roadblock\nrather than a resource. Thermodynamic AI hardware can be viewed as a novel form\nof computing, since it uses a novel fundamental building block. We identify\nstochastic bits (s-bits) and stochastic modes (s-modes) as the respective\nbuilding blocks for discrete and continuous Thermodynamic AI hardware. In\naddition to these stochastic units, Thermodynamic AI hardware employs a\nMaxwell's demon device that guides the system to produce non-trivial states.

For such interposer-based SiPs, there is\na push to realize on-interposer inter-chiplet communication bandwidth of\nmulti-Tb/s and end-to-end communication latency of no more than 10ns. This push\ncomes as the natural progression from some recent prior works on SiP design,\nand is driven by the proliferating bandwidth demand of modern data-intensive\nworkloads. To meet this bandwidth and latency goal, prior works have focused on\na potential solution of using the silicon photonic interposer (SiPhI) for\nintegrating and interconnecting a large number of chiplets into an SiP. Despite\nthe early promise, the existing designs of on-SiPhI interconnects still have to\nevolve by leaps and bounds to meet the goal of multi-Tb/s bandwidth. However,\nthe possible design pathways, upon which such an evolution can be achieved,\nhave not been explored in any prior works yet. In this paper, we have\nidentified several design pathways that can help evolve on-SiPhI interconnects\nto achieve multi-Tb/s aggregate bandwidth. We perform an extensive link-level\nand system-level analysis in which we explore these design pathways in\nisolation and in different combinations of each other. From our link-level\nanalysis, we have observed that the design pathways that simultaneously enhance\nthe spectral range and optical power budget available for wavelength\nmultiplexing can render aggregate bandwidth of up to 4Tb/s per on-SiPhI link.\n",

Despite showing outstanding speed and\nenergy efficiency, Josephson junction-based circuits suffer from several\nchallenges such as flux trapping leading to limited scalability, difficulty in\ndriving high impedances, and so on. Three-terminal cryotron devices have been\nproposed to solve these issues which can drive high impedances (>100 k{\\Omega})\nand are free from any flux trapping issue.

In this paper, we focus\non optimization problems related to permutations, where the goal is to find the\noptimal permutation out of the $n!$ possible permutations of $n$ elements. To\nrepresent these problems as Ising models, a commonly employed approach is to\nuse a kernel that utilizes one-hot encoding to find any one of the $n!$\npermutations as the optimal solution. However, this kernel contains a large\nnumber of quadratic terms and high absolute coefficient values. The main\ncontribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel permutation encoding\ntechnique called dual-matrix domain-wall, which significantly reduces the\nnumber of quadratic terms and the maximum absolute coefficient values in the\nkernel. Surprisingly, our dual-matrix domain-wall encoding reduces the\nquadratic term count and maximum absolute coefficient values from $n^3-n^2$ and\n$2n-4$ to $6n^2-12n+4$ and $2$, respectively.

To address such a need, silicon-photonic-based neural network\n(SP-NN) accelerators have recently emerged as a promising alternative to\nelectronic accelerators due to their lower latency and higher energy\nefficiency. Not only can SP-NNs alleviate the fan-in and fan-out problem with\nlinear algebra processors, their operational bandwidth can match that of the\nphotodetection rate (typically 100 GHz), which is at least over an order of\nmagnitude faster than electronic counterparts that are restricted to a clock\nrate of a few GHz. Unfortunately, the underlying silicon photonic devices in\nSP-NNs suffer from inherent optical losses and crosstalk noise originating from\nfabrication imperfections and undesired optical couplings, the impact of which\naccumulates as the network scales up. Consequently, the inferencing accuracy in\nan SP-NN can be affected by such inefficiencies -- e.g., can drop to below 10%\n-- the impact of which is yet to be fully studied. In this paper, we\ncomprehensively model the optical loss and crosstalk noise using a bottom-up\napproach, from the device to the system level, in coherent SP-NNs built using\nMach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) devices. The proposed models can be applied\nto any SP-NN architecture with different configurations to analyze the effect\nof loss and crosstalk. Such an analysis is important where there are\ninferencing accuracy and scalability requirements to meet when designing an\nSP-NN. Using the proposed analytical framework, we show a high power penalty\nand a catastrophic inferencing accuracy drop of up to 84% for SP-NNs of\ndifferent scales with three known MZI mesh configurations (i.e., Reck,\nClements, and Diamond) due to accumulated optical loss and crosstalk noise.\n",

At the\nsame time, reaction wheels used in the attitude determination and control\nsystem (ADCS) introduce high frequency jitter which can disrupt pointing\nstability. For space domain awareness (SDA) tasks that track objects tens of\nthousands of kilometres away, the pointing accuracy offered by current\nnanosats, typically in the range of 10 to 100 arcseconds, is not sufficient. In\nthis work, we develop a novel payload that utilises a neuromorphic event sensor\n(for high frequency and highly accurate relative attitude estimation) paired in\na closed loop with a piezoelectric stage (for active attitude corrections) to\nprovide highly stable sensor-specific pointing. Event sensors are especially\nsuited for space applications due to their desirable characteristics of low\npower consumption, asynchronous operation, and high dynamic range. We use the\nevent sensor to first estimate a reference background star field from which\ninstantaneous relative attitude is estimated at high frequency. The\npiezoelectric stage works in a closed control loop with the event sensor to\nperform attitude corrections based on the discrepancy between the current and\ndesired attitude. Results in a controlled setting show that we can achieve a\npointing accuracy in the range of 1-5 arcseconds using our novel payload at an\noperating frequency of up to 50Hz using a prototype built from\ncommercial-off-the-shelf components.

In order to meet the\nrequirements of multi-client accessing or computing encrypted cloud data, all\nclients with limited quantum ability outsource the key generation to a trusted\nkey center and upload their encrypted data to the data center.

However, deploying existing DL models on such\nplatforms is not trivial, since a great range of photonic neural network\narchitectures relies on incoherent setups and power addition operational\nschemes that cannot natively represent negative quantities. This results in\nadditional hardware complexity that increases cost and reduces energy\nefficiency. To overcome this, we can train non-negative neural networks and\npotentially exploit the full range of incoherent neuromorphic photonic\ncapabilities. However, existing approaches cannot achieve the same level of\naccuracy as their regular counterparts, due to training difficulties, as also\nrecent evidence suggests. To this end, we introduce a methodology to obtain the\nnon-negative isomorphic equivalents of regular neural networks that meet\nrequirements of neuromorphic hardware, overcoming the aforementioned\nlimitations. Furthermore, we also introduce a sign-preserving optimization\napproach that enables training of such isomorphic networks in a non-negative\nmanner.\n",

Two\nstrategies are promising for achieving low energy consumption and fast\nprocessing speeds in end-to-end neuromorphic applications. First, to directly\nencode analog signals to spikes to bypass the need for an analog-to-digital\nconverter (ADC). Second, to use temporal encoding techniques to maximize the\nspike sparsity, which is a crucial parameter for fast and efficient\nneuromorphic processing. In this work, we propose an adaptive control of the\nrefractory period of the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model for\nencoding continuous analog signals into a train of time-coded spikes. The\nLIF-based encoder generates phase-encoded spikes that are compatible with\ndigital hardware. We implemented the neuron model on a physical circuit and\ntested it with different electric signals. A digital neuromorphic chip\nprocessed the generated spike trains and computed the signal's frequency\nspectrum using a spiking version of the Fourier transform. We tested the\nprototype circuit on electric signals up to 1 KHz. Thus, we provide an\nend-to-end neuromorphic application that generates the frequency spectrum of an\nelectric signal without the need for an ADC or a digital signal processing\nalgorithm.\n",

However, analogue computing\nstill faces the same challenges as before: programming nonidealities and\nexpensive programming due to the underlying devices physics.

Neuromorphic\ncircuits are a promising approach to computing where techniques used by the\nbrain to achieve high efficiency are exploited. Many existing neuromorphic\ncircuits rely on unconventional and useful properties of novel technologies to\nbetter mimic the operation of the brain. One such technology is single flux\nquantum (SFQ) logic -- a cryogenic superconductive technology in which the data\nare represented by quanta of magnetic flux (fluxons) produced and processed by\nJosephson junctions embedded within inductive loops. The movement of a fluxon\nwithin a circuit produces a quantized voltage pulse (SFQ pulse), resembling a\nneuronal spiking event. These circuits routinely operate at clock frequencies\nof tens to hundreds of gigahertz, making SFQ a natural technology for\nprocessing high frequency pulse trains.\n  Prior proposals for SFQ neural networks often require energy-expensive fluxon\nconversions, involve heterogeneous technologies, or exclusively focus on device\nlevel behavior.

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is an\nemerging, brain-inspired machine learning technique that enjoys several\nadvantages over existing DNNs, including being lightweight, requiring\nlow-precision operands, and being robust to noise introduced by the\nnonidealities in the hardware.

This\nbelief led to simplified models of BMs with restricted intralayer connections\nor layer-by-layer training of deep BMs. Recent developments in domain-specific\nhardware -- specifically probabilistic computers (p-computer) with\nprobabilistic bits (p-bit) -- may change established wisdom on the tractability\nof deep BMs. In this paper, we show that deep and unrestricted BMs can be\ntrained using p-computers generating hundreds of billions of Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) samples per second, on sparse networks developed originally for\nuse in D-Wave's annealers. To maximize the efficiency of learning the\np-computer, we introduce two families of Mean-Field Theory assisted learning\nalgorithms, or xMFTs (x = Naive and Hierarchical). The xMFTs are used to\nestimate the averages and correlations during the positive phase of the\ncontrastive divergence (CD) algorithm and our custom-designed p-computer is\nused to estimate the averages and correlations in the negative phase. A custom\nField-Programmable-Gate Array (FPGA) emulation of the p-computer architecture\ntakes up to 45 billion flips per second, allowing the implementation of CD-$n$\nwhere $n$ can be of the order of millions, unlike RBMs where $n$ is typically 1\nor 2. Experiments on the full MNIST dataset with the combined algorithm show\nthat the positive phase can be efficiently computed by xMFTs without much\ndegradation when the negative phase is computed by the p-computer. Our\nalgorithm can be used in other scalable Ising machines and its variants can be\nused to train BMs, previously thought to be intractable.\n",

Accurate and scalable simulation\ntools for photonic integrated circuits are critical for designing neuromorphic\nphotonic circuits. This is especially important when designing networks with\nrecurrent connections, where the dynamics of the system may give rise to\nunstable and oscillatory solutions which need to be accurately modelled. These\ntools must simultaneously simulate the analog electronics and the multi-channel\n(wavelength-division-multiplexed) photonics contained in a photonic neuron to\naccurately predict on-chip behaviour. In this paper, we utilize a Verilog-A\nmodel of the photonic neural network to investigate the dynamics of recurrent\nintegrated circuits. We begin by reviewing the theory of continuous-time\nrecurrent neural networks as dynamical systems and the relation of these\ndynamics to important physical features of photonic neurons such as\ncascadability. We then present the neural dynamics of systems of one and two\nneurons in the simulated Verilog-A circuit, which are compared to the expected\ndynamics of the abstract CTRNN model. Due to the presence of parasitic circuit\nelements in the Verilog-A simulation, it is seen that there is a topological\nequivalence, but not an exact isomorphism, between the theoretical model and\nthe simulated model.

The difference between them is\nthat the potential energy barrier in a BSN LBM, albeit low, is much higher than\nthat in an ASN LBM.

However, the deployment of\nanalog photonic tensor accelerators encounters reliability challenges due to\nhardware noise and environmental variations. While off-chip noise-aware\ntraining and on-chip training have been proposed to enhance the variation\ntolerance of optical neural accelerators with moderate, static noise, we\nobserve a notable performance degradation over time due to temporally drifting\nvariations, which requires a real-time, in-situ calibration mechanism. To\ntackle this challenging reliability issues, for the first time, we propose a\nlightweight dynamic on-chip remediation framework, dubbed DOCTOR, providing\nadaptive, in-situ accuracy recovery against temporally drifting noise. The\nDOCTOR framework intelligently monitors the chip status using adaptive probing\nand performs fast in-situ training-free calibration to restore accuracy when\nnecessary. Recognizing nonuniform spatial variation distributions across\ndevices and tensor cores, we also propose a variation-aware architectural\nremapping strategy to avoid executing critical tasks on noisy devices.\nExtensive experiments show that our proposed framework can guarantee sustained\nperformance under drifting variations with 34% higher accuracy and 2-3\norders-of-magnitude lower overhead compared to state-of-the-art on-chip\ntraining methods.

SFQ systems operate at tens of gigahertz with up to\nthree orders of magnitude smaller power as compared to CMOS. In conventional\nSFQ systems, most gates require clock signal. Each gate should have the fanins\nwith equal logic depth, necessitating insertion of path-balancing (PB) DFFs,\nincurring prohibitive area penalty. Multiphase clocking is the effective method\nfor reducing the path-balancing overhead at the cost of reduced throughput.\nHowever, existing tools are not directly applicable for technology mapping of\nmultiphase systems. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we propose a\ntechnology mapping tool for multiphase systems. Our contribution is threefold.\nFirst, we formulate a phase assignment as a Constraint Programming with\nSatisfiability (CP-SAT) problem, to determine the phase of each element within\nthe network. Second, we formulate the path balancing problem as a CP-SAT to\noptimize the number of DFFs within an asynchronous datapath. Finally, we\nintegrate these methods into a technology mapping flow to convert a logic\nnetwork into a multiphase SFQ circuit. In our case studies, by using seven\nphases, the size of the circuit (expressed as the number of Josephson\njunctions) is reduced, on average, by 59.94 % as compared to the dual\n(fast-slow) clocking method, while outperforming the state-of-the-art\nsingle-phase SFQ mapping tools.\n",

        "summary": "  Wireless communication is rapidly evolving, and future wireless\ncommunications (6G and beyond) will be more heterogeneous, multi-layered, and\ncomplex, which poses challenges to traditional communications. Adaptive\ntechnologies in traditional communication systems respond to environmental\nchanges by modifying system parameters and structures on their own and are not\nflexible and agile enough to satisfy requirements in future communications. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving communication\nframework, which consists of three layers: data layer, information layer, and\nknowledge layer. The first two layers allow communication systems to sense\nenvironments, fuse data, and generate a knowledge base for the knowledge layer.\nWhen dealing with a variety of application scenarios and environments, the\ngenerated knowledge is subsequently fed back to the first two layers for\ncommunication in practical application scenarios to obtain self-evolving\nability and enhance the robustness of the system. In this paper, we first\nhighlight the limitations of current adaptive communication systems and the\nneed for intelligence, automation, and self-evolution in future wireless\ncommunications. We overview the development of self-evolving technologies and\nconceive the concept of self-evolving communications with its hypothetical\narchitecture. To demonstrate the power of self-evolving modules, we compare the\nperformances of a communication system with and without evolution. We then\nprovide some potential techniques that enable self-evolving communications and\nchallenges in implementing them.\n",

We demonstrate our approach's efficacy by\npredicting a second-order nonlinear dynamical system with an extremely low\nprediction error (0.00018). Additionally, we predict a chaotic H\\'enon map,\nachieving a low normalized root mean square error (0.080). Unlike previous\nPRCs, such errors are achieved without input encoding methods, underscoring the\npower of distinct input-state correlations. Most importantly, we generalize our\napproach to other neuromorphic devices that lack inherent voltage offsets using\nexternally applied offsets to realize various input-state correlations. Our\napproach and unprecedented performance are a major milestone towards\nhigh-performance full in-materia PRCs.\n",

PNNs compute using light, which leads to\nseveral differences in implementation when compared to electronics, such as the\nneed to represent input features in the photonic domain before feeding them\ninto the network. In this encoding process, it is common to combine multiple\nfeatures into a single input to reduce the number of inputs and associated\ndevices, leading to smaller and more energy-efficient PNNs. Although this\nalters the network's handling of input data, its impact on PNNs remains\nunderstudied. This paper addresses this open question, investigating the effect\nof commonly used encoding strategies that combine features on the performance\nand learning capabilities of PNNs. Here, using the concept of feature\nimportance, we develop a mathematical methodology for analyzing feature\ncombination. Through this methodology, we demonstrate that encoding multiple\nfeatures together in a single input determines their relative importance, thus\nlimiting the network's ability to learn from the data.

Consequently, the paradigm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)\nhaving AI techniques at its core implies additional energy and carbon costs\nthat may become significant with more complex neural architectures. To better\nunderstand the energy and Carbon Footprint (CF) of some AIoT components, very\nrecent studies employ conventional metrics. However, these metrics are not\ndesigned to capture energy efficiency aspects of inference. In this paper, we\npropose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AIoT Lifecycle (eCAL) to capture the\noverall energy cost of inference over the lifecycle of an AIoT system. We\ndevise a new methodology for determining eCAL of an AIoT system by analyzing\nthe complexity of data manipulation in individual components involved in the\nAIoT lifecycle and derive the overall and per bit energy consumption. With eCAL\nwe show that the better a model is and the more it is used, the more energy\nefficient an inference is. For an example AIoT configuration, eCAL for making\n$100$ inferences is $1.43$ times higher than for $1000$ inferences. We also\nevaluate the CF of the AIoT system by calculating the equivalent CO$_{2}$\nemissions based on the energy consumption and the Carbon Intensity (CI) across\ndifferent countries. Using 2023 renewable data, our analysis reveals that\ndeploying an AIoT system in Germany results in emitting $4.62$ times higher\nCO$_2$ than in Finland, due to latter using more low-CI energy sources.\n",

However, in addition to network state information, a\nquantum routing protocol must also take into account the requested entanglement\nfidelity, the probabilistic nature of swapping operations, and the short\nlifetime of entangled states. In this work, we formulate a practical\nentanglement routing problem and analyze and categorize the main approaches to\naddress it, drawing comparisons to, and inspiration from, classical network\nrouting strategies where applicable.

They can benefit from the prevalent approach of\nfirst training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and then translating to an\nSNN with subsequent hyperparameter tuning. The tuning is required to ensure\nthat the resulting SNN is accurate with respect to the ANN in terms of metrics\nlike Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, SNN controllers for safety-critical\nCPSs must also satisfy safety specifications, which are not guaranteed by the\nconversion approach. In this paper, we propose a solution which tunes the\n$temporal$ $window$ hyperparameter of the translated SNN to ensure both\naccuracy and compliance with the safe range specification that requires the SNN\noutputs to remain within a safe range. The core verification problem is\nmodelled using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and is solved with\nGurobi. When the controller fails to meet the range specification, we compute\ntight bounds on the SNN outputs as feedback for the CPS developer. To mitigate\nthe high computational cost of verification, we integrate data-driven steps to\nminimize verification calls. Our approach provides designers with the\nconfidence to safely integrate energy-efficient SNN controllers into modern\nCPSs. We demonstrate our approach with experimental results on five different\nbenchmark neural controllers.\n",

In\npractice, DTs of physical devices, such as mobile users (MUs), are commonly\ndeployed in multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks for the sake of reducing\nlatency. To ensure the accuracy and fidelity of DTs, it is essential for MUs to\nregularly synchronize their status with their DTs. However, MU mobility\nintroduces significant challenges to DT synchronization. Firstly, MU mobility\ntriggers DT migration which could cause synchronization failures. Secondly, MUs\nrequire frequent synchronization with their DTs to ensure DT fidelity.\nNonetheless, DT migration among MEC servers, caused by MU mobility, may occur\ninfrequently. Accordingly, we propose a two-timescale DT synchronization and\nmigration framework with reliability consideration by establishing a non-convex\nstochastic problem to minimize the long-term average energy consumption of MUs.\nWe use Lyapunov theory to convert the reliability constraints and reformulate\nthe new problem as a partially observable Markov decision-making process\n(POMDP).

Perceptual\nstudies confirm that they can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns\nwith high fidelity.

        "summary": "  The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most\nprominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been\nintroduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address\nspecific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently\nutilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the\nHybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to\naccelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and\noperational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this\nportfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this\nsolver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across\nthree combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the\nKnapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this\nrelatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to\nsolve these three optimization problems.\n",

Comprising a 'neuro' component for feature extraction\nand a 'symbolic' component for decision-making, neuro-symbolic AI has yet to\nfully benefit from efficient hardware accelerators. Additionally, current\nhardware struggles to accommodate applications requiring dynamic resource\nallocation between these two components. To address these challenges-and\nmitigate the typical data-transfer bottleneck of classical Von Neumann\narchitectures-we propose a ferroelectric charge-domain compute-in-memory (CiM)\narray as the foundational processing element for neuro-symbolic AI.

This design, overcomes the destructive sensing limitations of DRAM\nin CiM applications, while capable of capitalizing decades of DRAM expertise\nwith a similar cell structure as DRAM, achieves high immunity against FeFET\nvariation-crucial for neuro-symbolic AI-and demonstrates superior energy\nefficiency.

MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical\napplications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and\nholistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these\napplications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here\nreferred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly\nbranched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology\nof such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at\na target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical\nend-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in\nlinear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to\nany MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as\nsignaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering\ncomponents that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively\nisolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model\nwith testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule\ndelay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule\ndispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the\ncharacterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the\nnetwork topology.

Conventional detection methods\noften struggle under varying channel conditions, leading to high bit error\nrates (BER) and reduced communication efficiency. This paper introduces ART-Rx,\na novel Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for MC that addresses these\nchallenges. Implemented within a conceptual system-on-chip (SoC), ART-Rx\nemploys a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically\nadjust the detection threshold based on observed errors in real time.\nComprehensive simulations using MATLAB and Smoldyn compare ART-Rx's performance\nagainst a statistically optimal detection threshold across various scenarios,\nincluding different levels of interference, concentration shift keying (CSK)\nlevels, flow velocities, transmitter-receiver distances, diffusion\ncoefficients, and binding rates.

The main adapted principle of constructing such systems is\nbased on requiring that, on the one hand, the system converges to a binary\nstate and, on the other hand, the system's energy in such states mimics the\nclassical Ising Hamiltonian. The emergence of binary-like states is regarded to\nbe an indispensable feature of dynamical Ising machines as it establishes the\nrelation between the machine's continuous terminal state and the inherently\ndiscrete solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. This is emphasized\nby problems where the unknown quantities are represented by spin complexes, for\nexample, the graph coloring problem. In such cases, an imprecise mapping of the\ncontinuous states to spin configurations may lead to invalid solutions\nrequiring intensive post-processing. In contrast to such an approach, we show\nthat there exists a class of non-binary dynamical Ising machines without the\nincongruity between the continuous character of the machine's states and the\ndiscreteness of the spin states. We demonstrate this feature by applying such a\nmachine to the problems of finding proper graph coloring, constructing Latin\nsquares, and solving Sudoku puzzles. Thus, we demonstrate that the information\ncharacterizing discrete states can be unambiguously presented in essentially\ncontinuous dynamical systems.

        "summary": "  This paper proposes an approach to perform travel demand calibration for\nhigh-resolution stochastic traffic simulators. It employs abundant travel times\nat the path-level, departing from the standard practice of resorting to scarce\nsegment-level sensor counts. The proposed approach is shown to tackle\nhigh-dimensional instances in a sample-efficient way. For the first time, case\nstudies on 6 metropolitan highway networks are carried out, considering a total\nof 54 calibration scenarios. This is the first work to show the ability of a\ncalibration algorithm to systematically scale across networks. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)\nalgorithm, the proposed approach enhances fit to field data by an average 43.5%\nwith a maximum improvement of 80.0%, and does so within fewer simulation calls.\n",

        "summary": "  Ising machines (IM) are physics-inspired alternatives to von Neumann\narchitectures for solving hard optimization tasks. By mapping binary variables\nto coupled Ising spins, IMs can naturally solve unconstrained combinatorial\noptimization problems such as finding maximum cuts in graphs. However, despite\ntheir importance in practical applications, constrained problems remain\nchallenging to solve for IMs that require large quadratic energy penalties to\nensure the correspondence between energy ground states and constrained optimal\nsolutions. To relax this requirement, we propose a self-adaptive IM that\niteratively shapes its energy landscape using a Lagrange relaxation of\nconstraints and avoids prior tuning of penalties. Using a probabilistic-bit\n(p-bit) IM emulated in software, we benchmark our algorithm with\nmultidimensional knapsack problems (MKP) and quadratic knapsack problems (QKP),\nthe latter being an Ising problem with linear constraints. For QKP with 300\nvariables, the proposed algorithm finds better solutions than state-of-the-art\nIMs such as Fujitsu's Digital Annealer and requires 7,500x fewer samples. Our\nresults show that adapting the energy landscape during the search can speed up\nIMs for constrained optimization.\n",

Then, we develop a\njoint scheduling and beamforming framework that optimizes the OTA-FEEL\nperformance while keeping the sensing and communication quality, determined\nrespectively in terms of Cramer-Rao bound and achievable downlink rate, in a\ndesired range. The resulting scheduling problem reduces to a combinatorial\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). We develop a\nlow-complexity hierarchical method based on the matching pursuit algorithm used\nwidely for sparse recovery in the literature of compressed sensing. The\nproposed algorithm uses a step-wise strategy to omit the least effective\ndevices in each iteration based on a metric that captures both the aggregation\nand sensing quality of the system. It further invokes alternating optimization\nscheme to iteratively update the downlink beamforming and uplink\npost-processing by marginally optimizing them in each iteration. Convergence\nand complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. Numerical\nevaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed algorithm. The results show that by leveraging accurate sensing, the\ntarget echoes on the uplink signal can be effectively suppressed, ensuring the\nquality of model aggregation to remain intact despite the interference.\n",

For internal logic, we investigate how arbitrary computations\ncan be implemented. We demonstrate how to encode dual-rail logic to build a\nuniversal logic gate that concurrently evaluates and, nand, nor, and or\noperations. Using many of these gates and appropriate interconnects, we can\nevaluate any logical expression.

In this\npaper, we ask: Can we build a global exchange where everyone can contribute\ncomputation and data to train the next generation of machine learning\napplications?\n  We present an early, but running prototype of DataBright, a system that turns\nthe creation of training examples and the sharing of computation into an\ninvestment mechanism. Unlike most crowdsourcing platforms, where the\ncontributor gets paid when they submit their data, DataBright pays dividends\nwhenever a contributor's data or hardware is used by someone to train a machine\nlearning model. The contributor becomes a shareholder in the dataset they\ncreated. To enable the measurement of usage, a computation platform that\ncontributors can trust is also necessary. DataBright thus merges both a data\nmarket and a trusted computation market.\n  We illustrate that trusted computation can enable the creation of an AI\nmarket, where each data point has an exact value that should be paid to its\ncreator. DataBright allows data creators to retain ownership of their\ncontribution and attaches to it a measurable value. The value of the data is\ngiven by its utility in subsequent distributed computation done on the\nDataBright computation market. The computation market allocates tasks and\nsubsequent payments to pooled hardware. This leads to the creation of a\ndecentralized AI cloud. Our experiments show that trusted hardware such as\nIntel SGX can be added to the usual ML pipeline with no additional costs.

Many analogue physical systems\nincluding nonlinear oscillator networks, lasers, and condensates were proposed\nand realised to address hard computational problems from various areas of\nsocial and physical sciences and technology. The analogue systems emulate spin\nHamiltonians with continuous or discrete degrees of freedom to which actual\noptimisation problems can be mapped. Understanding the underlying physical\nprocess by which the system finds the ground state often leads to new classes\nof system-inspired or quantum-inspired algorithms for hard optimisation.\nTogether physical platforms and related algorithms can be combined to form a\nhybrid architecture that may one day compete with conventional computing. In\nthis Chapter, we review some of the systems and physically-inspired algorithms\nthat show such promise.\n",

As AI solutions have become more sophistication and the\nuse cases grew, they highlighted the need to address performance and energy\nefficiency challenges faced during the implementation process. To address these\nchallenges, there has been growing interest in neuromorphic chips. Neuromorphic\ncomputing relies on non von Neumann architectures as well as novel devices,\ncircuits and manufacturing technologies to mimic the human brain. Among such\ntechnologies, 3D integration is an important enabler for AI hardware and the\ncontinuation of the scaling laws. In this paper, we overview the unique\nopportunities 3D integration provides in neuromorphic chip design, discuss the\nemerging opportunities in next generation neuromorphic architectures and review\nthe obstacles. Neuromorphic architectures, which relied on the brain for\ninspiration and emulation purposes, face grand challenges due to the limited\nunderstanding of the functionality and the architecture of the human brain.\nYet, high-levels of investments are dedicated to develop neuromorphic chips. We\nargue that 3D integration not only provides strategic advantages to the\ncost-effective and flexible design of neuromorphic chips, it may provide design\nflexibility in incorporating advanced capabilities to further benefits the\ndesigns in the future.\n",

As an\nalternative to scaling transistors for general-purpose computing, the\nintegration of transistors with unconventional technologies has emerged as a\npromising path for domain-specific computing. In this article, we provide a\nfull-stack review of probabilistic computing with p-bits as a representative\nexample of the energy-efficient and domain-specific computing movement. We\nargue that p-bits could be used to build energy-efficient probabilistic\nsystems, tailored for probabilistic algorithms and applications. From hardware,\narchitecture, and algorithmic perspectives, we outline the main applications of\nprobabilistic computers ranging from probabilistic machine learning and AI to\ncombinatorial optimization and quantum simulation. Combining emerging\nnanodevices with the existing CMOS ecosystem will lead to probabilistic\ncomputers with orders of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and\nprobabilistic sampling, potentially unlocking previously unexplored regimes for\npowerful probabilistic algorithms.\n",

Optical\nmatrix-vector multipliers are best suited to performing computations with very\nlarge operands, which suggests that large Transformer models could be a good\ntarget for optical computing. To test this idea, we performed small-scale\noptical experiments with a prototype accelerator to demonstrate that\nTransformer operations can run on optical hardware despite noise and errors.\nUsing simulations, validated by our experiments, we then explored the energy\nefficiency of optical implementations of Transformers and identified scaling\nlaws for model performance with respect to optical energy usage. We found that\nthe optical energy per multiply-accumulate (MAC) scales as $\\frac{1}{d}$ where\n$d$ is the Transformer width, an asymptotic advantage over digital systems. We\nconclude that with well-engineered, large-scale optical hardware, it may be\npossible to achieve a $100 \\times$ energy-efficiency advantage for running some\nof the largest current Transformer models, and that if both the models and the\noptical hardware are scaled to the quadrillion-parameter regime, optical\ncomputers could have a $>8,000\\times$ energy-efficiency advantage over\nstate-of-the-art digital-electronic processors that achieve 300 fJ/MAC. We\nanalyzed how these results motivate and inform the construction of future\noptical accelerators along with optics-amenable deep-learning approaches. With\nassumptions about future improvements to electronics and Transformer\nquantization techniques (5$\\times$ cheaper memory access, double the\ndigital--analog conversion efficiency, and 4-bit precision), we estimated that\noptical computers' advantage against current 300-fJ/MAC digital processors\ncould grow to $>100,000\\times$.\n",

From kinetic\nMonte Carlo simulations we analyze the critical nonlinear aspects of\nvariable-range hopping transport for realizing Boolean logic gates in these\ndevices on three levels. First, we quantify the occurrence of individual gates\nfor random choices of control voltages. We find that linearly inseparable gates\nsuch as the XOR gate are less likely to occur than linearly separable gates\nsuch as the AND gate, despite the fact that the number of different regions in\nthe multidimensional control voltage space for which AND or XOR gates occur is\ncomparable. Second, we use principal component analysis to characterize the\ndistribution of the output current vectors for the (00,10,01,11) logic input\ncombinations in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the output covariance\nmatrix. This allows a simple and direct comparison of the behavior of different\nsimulated devices and a comparison to experimental devices.

As digital\ncomputing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a\npromising platform to complement existing digital systems.

This language is,\neffectively, a digital representation of the analog signals shown by the\nproteinoids. We use two different experimental techniques: (i) a\nvoltage-sensitive dye and (ii) a pair of differential electrodes, to record the\nanalog signals. The analog signals are digitally approximatied (synthesised) by\nsampling the analog signals into a series of discrete values, which are then\nconverted into binary representations. We have shown the\nAND-OR-NOT-XOR-NOR-NAND-XNOR gate representation of the digitally sampled\nsignal of proteinoids. Additional encoding schemes are applied to convert the\nbinary code identified above to a two-dimensional QR code. As a result, the QR\ncode becomes a digital, unique marker of a given proteinoid network. We show\nthat it is possible to retrieve the analog signal from the QR code by scanning\nthe QR code using a mobile phone. Our work shows that soft matter fluidic\nsystems, such as proteinoids, can have a fundamental informatiom-theoretic\nlanguage, unique to their internal information transmission properties\n(electrical activity in this case) - such a language can be made universal and\naccessible to everyone using 2D QR codes, which can digitally encode their\ninternal properties and give an option to recover the original signal when\nrequired. On a more fundamental note, this study identifies the techniques of\napproximating continuum properties of soft matter fluidic systems using a\nseries representation of gates and QR codes, which are a piece-wise digital\nrepresentation, and thus one step closer to programming the fluids using\ninformation-theoretic methods, as suggested almost a decade ago by Tao's fluid\nprogram.\n",

        "summary": "  Emerging distributed generation demands highly reliable and resilient\ncoordinating control in microgrids. To improve on these aspects, spiking neural\nnetwork is leveraged, as a grid-edge intelligence tool to establish a talkative\ninfrastructure, Spike Talk, expediting coordination in next-generation\nmicrogrids without the need of communication at all. This paper unravels the\nphysics behind Spike Talk from the perspective of its distributed\ninfrastructure, which aims to address the Von Neumann Bottleneck. Relying on\ninferring information via power flows in tie lines, Spike Talk allows adaptive\nand flexible control and coordination itself, and features in synaptic\nplasticity facilitating online and local training functionality. Preliminary\ncase studies are demonstrated with results, while more extensive validations\nare to be included as future scopes of work.\n",

We describe a new\nreaction network scheme for solving a large class of statistical problems\nincluding the problem of how a cell would infer its environment from\nreceptor-ligand bindings. Specifically we show how reaction networks can\nimplement information projection, and consequently a generalized\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm, to solve maximum likelihood estimation\nproblems in partially-observed exponential families on categorical data. Our\nscheme can be thought of as an algorithmic interpretation of E. T. Jaynes's\nvision of statistical mechanics as statistical inference.\n",

        "summary": "  Bias-scalable analog computing is attractive for implementing machine\nlearning (ML) processors with distinct power-performance specifications. For\ninstance, ML implementations for server workloads are focused on higher\ncomputational throughput for faster training, whereas ML implementations for\nedge devices are focused on energy-efficient inference. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the implementation of bias-scalable approximate analog computing\ncircuits using the generalization of the margin-propagation principle called\nshape-based analog computing (S-AC). The resulting S-AC core integrates several\nnear-memory compute elements, which include: (a) non-linear activation\nfunctions; (b) inner-product compute circuits; and (c) a mixed-signal\ncompressive memory, all of which can be scaled for performance or power while\npreserving its functionality. Using measured results from prototypes fabricated\nin a 180nm CMOS process, we demonstrate that the performance of computing\nmodules remains robust to transistor biasing and variations in temperature. In\nthis paper, we also demonstrate the effect of bias-scalability and\ncomputational accuracy on a simple ML regression task.\n",

        "summary": "  We propose and analyze a compact and non-volatile nanomagnetic (all-spin)\nnon-binary matrix multiplier performing the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC)\noperation using two magnetic tunnel junctions - one activated by strain to act\nas the multiplier, and the other activated by spin-orbit torque pulses to act\nas a domain wall synapse that performs the operation of the accumulator. It has\ntwo advantages over the usual crossbar-based electronic non-binary matrix\nmultiplier. First, while the crossbar architecture requires N3 devices to\nmultiply two matrices, we require only 2N2 devices. Second, our matrix\nmultiplier is non-volatile and retains the information about the product matrix\nafter being powered off. Here, we present an example where each MAC operation\ncan be performed in ~5 ns and the maximum energy dissipated per operation is\n~60Nmax aJ, where Nmax is the largest matrix size. This provides a very useful\nhardware accelerator for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks\nwhich involve the multiplication of large matrices. The non-volatility allows\nthe matrix multiplier to be embedded in powerful non-von-Neumann architectures,\nincluding processor-in-memory. It also allows much of the computing to be done\nat the edge (of internet-of-things) while reducing the need to access the\ncloud, thereby making artificial intelligence more resilient against\ncyberattacks.\n",

        "summary": "  Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing\ndemands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence,\nbecause much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers\nbetween logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called \"computational\nrandom-access memory (CRAM)\" has emerged to address this fundamental\nlimitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells\nthemselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and\nperformance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications\nhave been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there lacks an\nexperimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computation\naccuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its\ntechnological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based\non magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First,\nbasic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are\nstudied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated.\nBased on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to\ncharacterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Scalar addition, multiplication,\nand matrix multiplication, which are essential building blocks for many\nconventional and machine intelligence applications, are evaluated and show\npromising accuracy performance. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's\naccuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant\nimpact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.\n",

        "summary": "  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems of autonomous systems such as drones,\nrobots and self-driving cars may consume up to 50% of total power available\nonboard, thereby limiting the vehicle's range of functions and considerably\nreducing the distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge.\nNext-generation onboard AI systems need an even higher power since they collect\nand process even larger amounts of data in real time. This problem cannot be\nsolved using the traditional computing devices since they become more and more\npower-consuming. In this review article, we discuss the perspectives of\ndevelopment of onboard neuromorphic computers that mimic the operation of a\nbiological brain using nonlinear-dynamical properties of natural physical\nenvironments surrounding autonomous vehicles. Previous research also\ndemonstrated that quantum neuromorphic processors (QNPs) can conduct\ncomputations with the efficiency of a standard computer while consuming less\nthan 1% of the onboard battery power. Since QNPs is a semi-classical\ntechnology, their technical simplicity and low, compared with quantum\ncomputers, cost make them ideally suitable for application in autonomous AI\nsystem. Providing a perspective view on the future progress in unconventional\nphysical reservoir computing and surveying the outcomes of more than 200\ninterdisciplinary research works, this article will be of interest to a broad\nreadership, including both students and experts in the fields of physics,\nengineering, quantum technologies and computing.\n",

A major challenge in this context is\nthat these networks are difficult to train since training here would require a\nchange of physical parameters rather than simply of coefficients in a computer\nprogram. For this reason, reservoir computing, where one employs\nhigh-dimensional recurrent networks and trains only the final layer, is widely\nused in this context. In this chapter, I introduce the basic concepts of\nreservoir computing.
