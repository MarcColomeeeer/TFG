Almost three centuries later, in ``The\nfoundations of mathematics,'' David Hilbert tried to ``recast mathematical\ndefinitions and inferences in such a way that they are unshakable.'' Hilbert's\nprogram relied explicitly on formal systems (equivalently, computational\nsystems) to provide certainty in mathematics. The concepts of computation and\nformal system were not defined in his time, but Descartes' method may be\nunderstood as seeking certainty in essentially the same way.\n  In this article, I explain formal systems as concrete artifacts, and\ninvestigate the way in which they provide a high level of certainty---arguably\nthe highest level achievable by rational discourse. The rich understanding of\nformal systems achieved by mathematical logic and computer science in this\ncentury illuminates the nature of programs, such as Descartes' and Hilbert's,\nthat seek certainty through rigorous analysis.\n",

        "summary": "  Generating high-quality schedules for a rotating workforce is a critical task\nin all settings where a certain staffing level must be guaranteed beyond the\ncapacity of single employees, such as for instance in industrial plants,\nhospitals, or airline companies. Results from ergonomics \\cite{BEST91} indicate\nthat rotating workforce schedules have a profound impact on the health and\nsocial life of employees as well as on their performance at work. Moreover,\nrotating workforce schedules must satisfy legal requirements and should also\nmeet the objectives of the employing organization. We describe our solution to\nthis problem. A basic design decision was to aim at quickly obtaining\nhigh-quality schedules for realistically sized problems while maintaining human\ncontrol. The interaction between the decision maker and the algorithm therefore\nconsists in four steps: (1) choosing a set of lengths of work blocks (a work\nblock is a sequence of consecutive days of work shifts), (2) choosing a\nparticular sequence of work and days-off blocks among those that have optimal\nweekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the\nchosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences\nof shifts, and (4) assignment of shift sequences to work blocks while\nfulfilling the staffing requirements. The combination of constraint\nsatisfaction and problem-oriented intelligent backtracking algorithms in each\nof the four steps allows to find good solutions for real-world problems in\nacceptable time. Computational results from real-world problems and from\nbenchmark examples found in the literature confirm the viability of our\napproach. The algorithms are now part of a commercial shift scheduling software\npackage.\n",

Experts from each laboratory would remain at their home\ninstitution but continue to participate in the operation of the machine after\nconstruction. Experts are required to be on site only during initial\ncommissioning and for par-ticularly difficult problems. Repairs require an\non-site non-expert maintenance crew.

This Hierarchical Storage Manager targetted at HEP applications has\nbeen in full production at CERN since May 2001. It now contains more than two\nPetabyte of data in roughly 9 million files. In 2002, 350 Terabytes of data\nwere stored for COMPASS at 45 MB/s and a Data Challenge was run for ALICE in\npreparation for the LHC startup in 2007 and sustained a data transfer to tape\nof 300 MB/s for one week (180 TB). The major functionality improvements were\nthe support for files larger than 2 GB (in collaboration with IN2P3) and the\ndevelopment of Grid interfaces to CASTOR: GridFTP and SRM (\"Storage Resource\nManager\"). An ongoing effort is taking place to copy the existing data from\nobsolete media like 9940 A to better cost effective offerings. CASTOR has also\nbeen deployed at several HEP sites with little effort. In 2003, we plan to\ncontinue working on Grid interfaces and to improve performance not only for\nCentral Data Recording but also for Data Analysis applications where thousands\nof processes possibly access the same hot data. This could imply the selection\nof another filesystem or the use of replication (hardware or software).\n",

This, with some future extension, can\nyield a new and unambiguous representation, $\\bar{\\sigma}$, of the surface\nconsisting of $n$-1 planar regions whose properties correspond lead to the {\\em\nrecognition} of the surfaces' properties i.e. developable, ruled etc.\n\\cite{hung92smooth}) and {\\em classification} criteria.\n  It is further shown that the image (i.e. representation) of an algebraic\nsurface of degree 2 in $\\Real^n$ is a region whose boundary is also an\nalgebraic curve of degree 2.

The\nresult is a ``line-curve'' which is seen as the envelope of it's tangents.\nUsually this gives an unclear image and is at the heart of the\n``over-plotting'' problem; a barrier in the effective use of Parallel\nCoordinates. This problem is overcome by a transformation which provides\ndirectly the ``point-curve'' representation of a curve. Earlier this was\napplied to conics and their generalizations. Here the representation, also\ncalled dual, is extended to all planar algebraic curves. Specifically, it is\nshown that the dual of an algebraic curve of degree $n$ is an algebraic of\ndegree at most $n(n - 1)$ in the absence of singular points. The result that\nconics map into conics follows as an easy special case. An algorithm, based on\nalgebraic geometry using resultants and homogeneous polynomials, is obtained\nwhich constructs the dual image of the curve. This approach has potential\ngeneralizations to multi-dimensional algebraic surfaces and their\napproximation. The ``trade-off'' price then for obtaining {\\em planar}\nrepresentation of multidimensional algebraic curves and hyper-surfaces is the\nhigher degree of the image's boundary which is also an algebraic curve in\n$\\|$-coords.\n",

Each of these two disciplines is\nnow well represented with respect to most computer science (CS) curricula. But,\nthe two disciplines are practiced almost independently - missing oppurtunities\nto collaborate, coordinate and communicate about the overall design - and\nthereby contributing to system failures. Today, a confluence of several\ningredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user\ninterface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of\nthe human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model\nto integrate the UI experts' UE development efforts with that of SE. This in\nturn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of\neducation and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration\nand coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the\ncurrent approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings.

These two aspects are the changes in the structure\nof organizations and the epistemology of Information Systems Development.\nFirstly, the conception of business processes within the management of\norganizations increases the structural complexity of Information Systems,\nbecause existing systems have to be integrated into a coherent cross-functional\narchitecture. Secondly, process thinking leads to a particular view of\norganizations that ultimately has a negative effect on the support of\nInformation Systems. As an illustration of process thinking, the Business\nProcess Reengineering movement adheres to a technocratic management perspective\nof organizations. Particularly this conception of organization views people as\nmechanisms to realize certain organizational goals. As a result of this view\nstakeholders are confronted with the implemented systems, rather than consulted\nabout the scope and functionality of those systems. Therefore, both aspects of\nprocess thinking have a negative impact on the success of IT projects. The\nproblem of structural complexity is an area that is addressed by Enterprise\nApplication Integration, and mainly requires technical solutions. However, the\nproblems associated with the conception of organization require a different,\nmarkedly non-technical, perspective. Several directions are discussed to\novercome some limitations of process thinking, but these directions are merely\nsmall pointers. If truly effective and useful Information Systems are to be\nacquired, IT practitioners and scientists require a completely different\nmindset.\n",

We will construct a mechanism that induces truthful\nrevelation of the agents' capability trees and chance events and to follow the\ninstructions about their hidden decisions. This enables the planner to select\nthe optimal subset of agents and obtain the efficient joint execution.

As the suppliers seek to secure\ntheir intellectual property (IP) rights, the customer usually has no direct\naccess to the suppliers' source code, and is able to enforce the use of\nverification tools only by legal requirements. In turn, the supplier has no\nmeans to convince the customer about successful verification without revealing\nthe source code. This paper presents an approach to resolve the conflict\nbetween the IP interests of the supplier and the quality interests of the\ncustomer. We introduce a protocol in which a dedicated server (called the\n\"amanat\") is controlled by both parties: the customer controls the verification\ntask performed by the amanat, while the supplier controls the communication\nchannels of the amanat to ensure that the amanat does not leak information\nabout the source code. We argue that the protocol is both practically useful\nand mathematically sound. As the protocol is based on well-known (and\nrelatively lightweight) cryptographic primitives, it allows a straightforward\nimplementation on top of existing verification tool chains. To substantiate our\nsecurity claims, we establish the correctness of the protocol by cryptographic\nreduction proofs.\n",

The EDCA uses Carrier Sense Multiple\nAccess with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and slotted Binary Exponential\nBackoff (BEB) mechanism. We present a simple mathematical analysis framework\nfor the EDCA function. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed\nrandom access systems exhibit cyclic behavior where each station successfully\ntransmits a packet in a cycle. Our analysis shows that an AC-specific cycle\ntime exists for the EDCA function. Validating the theoretical results via\nsimulations, we show that the proposed analysis accurately captures EDCA\nsaturation performance in terms of average throughput, medium access delay, and\npacket loss ratio. The cycle time analysis is a simple and insightful\nsubstitute for previously proposed more complex EDCA models.\n",

Next the contrast of the\ntransformed image is enhanced so as to compensate for brightness loss that\nwould arise from backlight dimming. The proposed approach relies on an accurate\ndefinition of the image distortion which takes into account both the pixel\nvalue differences and a model of the human visual system and is amenable to\nhighly efficient hardware realization. Experimental results show that the\nhistogram equalization for backlight scaling method results in about 45% power\nsaving with an effective distortion rate of 5% and 65% power saving for a 20%\ndistortion rate.

Consequently, mixing\nbetween two liquids is mainly obtained by natural diffusion which may take a\nlong time or equivalently requires centimetre length channels. To reduce time\nand length for mixing, it is possible to generate chaotic-like flows either by\nmodifying the channel geometry or by creating an external perturbation of the\nflow. In this paper, an active micromixer is presented consisting on thermal\nactuation with heating resistors. In order to disturb the liquid flow, an\noscillating transverse flow is generated by heating the liquid. Depending on\nthe value of boiling point, either bubble expansion or volumetric dilation\ncontrolled the transverse flow amplitude. A chaotic like mixing is then induced\nunder particular conditions depending on volume expansion, liquid velocity,\nfrequency of actuation... This solution presents the advantage to achieve\nmixing in a very short time (1s) and along a short channel distance (channel\nwidth).

Our goal is to scavenge energy by developing a miniature\npower source for operating electronic components. First Bi and Sb micro-devices\non silicon glass substrate have been manufactured with an area of 1cm2\nincluding more than one hundred junctions. Each step of process fabrication has\nbeen optimized: photolithography, deposition process, anneals conditions and\nmetallic connections. Different device structures have been realized with\ndifferent micro-line dimensions. Each devices performance will be reviewed and\ndiscussed in function of their design structure.\n",

In the static mode, we\nprovide experimental and theoretical demonstration that the pull-in effect can\nbe shifted beyond one third of the initial gap and even be eliminated when\nelectrostatic actuators are operated in liquids. This should benefit to\napplications in microfluidics requiring either binary state actuation (e.g.\npumps, valves) or continuous displacements over the whole gap (e.g.\nmicrotweezers). In dynamic mode, actuators like micro-cantilevers present a\ngreat interest for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in liquids. As this\napplication requires a good understanding of the cantilever resonance frequency\nand Q-factor, an analytical modeling in liquid environment has been\nestablished. The theoretically derived curves are validated by experimental\nresults using a nitride encapsulated cantilever with integrated electrostatic\nactuation. Electrode potential screening and undesirable electrochemistry in\ndielectric liquids are counteracted using AC-voltages. Both experimental and\ntheoretical results should prove useful in micro-cantilever design for AFM in\nliquids.\n",

METHODS: A prostate phantom was created. A three-dimensional real-time\nultrasound system with a 5.9MHz probe was used, making it possible to see\nseveral reconstructed orthogonal viewing planes in real time. Fourteen\noperators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound\n(TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies). The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation\nin a 3-D ultrasonographic volume. Special software was used to visualise the\nbiopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area. A comparative\nstudy was performed to examine the accuracy of the entry points and target of\nthe needle. Distribution was assessed by measuring the volume sampled and a\nredundancy ratio of the sampled prostate. RESULTS: A significant increase in\naccuracy in hitting the target zone was identified using 4-D ultrasonography as\ncompared to 2-D. There was no increase in the sampled volume or improvement in\nthe biopsy distribution with 4-D ultrasonography as compared to 2-D.\nCONCLUSION: The 4-D TRUS guidance appears to show, on a synthetic model, an\nimprovement in location accuracy and in the ability to reproduce a protocol.\nThe biopsy distribution does not seem improved.\n",

It\nrequires prostate delineation from the images for dose planning. Because\nultrasound imaging is patient- and operator-dependent, we have proposed to fuse\nMRI data to TRUS data to make image processing more reliable. The technical\naccuracy of this approach has already been evaluated. METHODS: We present work\nin progress concerning the evaluation of the approach from the dosimetry\nviewpoint. The objective is to determine what impact this system may have on\nthe treatment of the patient. Dose planning is performed from initial TRUS\nprostate contours and evaluated on contours modified by data fusion. RESULTS:\nFor the eight patients included, we demonstrate that TRUS prostate volume is\nmost often underestimated and that dose is overestimated in a correlated way.\nHowever, dose constraints are still verified for those eight patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This confirms our initial hypothesis.\n",

Even though some\ncountries, including the Security Big Six (SB6), are equipped with their\nsecurity books and may feel relatively safe; this remains a wrong sense of\nsecurity as long as they share their networks with entities of less security.\nThe standards impose security best practices and system specifications for the\ndevelopment of information security management systems. Partners beyond borders\nhave to be secure as this is only possible if all entities connected to the\npartnership remain secure. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the\ncontinuous security of partners without periodic security auditing and\ncertification, and members who do not comply should be barred from the\npartnership. This concept also applies to the cyber space or the electronic\nsociety.

Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are good\ncandidates to allow reconfigurable RF functions such as filters, oscillators or\nantennas. This paper will focus on the MEMS electromechanical resonators which\nshow interesting performances to replace SAW filters or quartz reference\noscillators, allowing smaller integrated functions with lower power\nconsumption. The resonant frequency depends on the material properties, such as\nYoung's modulus and density, and on the movable mechanical structure dimensions\n(beam length defined by photolithography). Thus, it is possible to obtain multi\nfrequencies resonators on a wafer. The resonator performance (frequency,\nquality factor) strongly depends on the environment, like moisture or pressure,\nwhich imply the need for a vacuum package. This paper will present first\nresonator mechanisms and mechanical behaviors followed by state of the art\ndescriptions with applications and specifications overview.

In the previous electro-thermal and\nthermo-elastic models of suspended polysilicon micro beams, the\nthermo-mechanical properties of polysilicon have been considered constant over\na wide rang of temperature (20- 900 degrees C). In reality, the\nthermo-mechanical properties of polysilicon depend on temperature and change\nsignificantly at high temperatures.

In the theoretical models, two parts of\nelastic deflection model and thermal elastic model of micro beams buckling have\nbeen established and simulated. Also, temperature dependent buckling of\npolysilicon micro beam under high temperature has been modeled by Finite\nElement Analysis (FEA). Analytical results and numerical results using FEA are\ncompared with experimental data available in literature. Their reasonable\nagreement validates analytical model and FEM.

The micro-diaphragm pump with two valves is\nfabricated in an aluminum case by using highly accurate CNC machine, and the\ncross-section dimension is 5mm x 8mm. Both valves and diaphragm are\nmanufactured from PDMS. The amplitude of vibration by a piezoelectric device\nproduces an oscillating flow which may change the chamber volume by changing\nthe curvature of a diaphragm. Several experimental set-ups for performance test\nin a single micro-diaphragm pump, isothermal flow open system, and a closed\nliquid cooling system is designed and implemented. The performance of one-side\nactuating micro-diaphragm pump is affected by the design of check valves,\ndiaphragm, piezoelectric device, chamber volume, input voltage and frequency.\nThe measured maximum flow rate of present design is 72 ml/min at zero total\npump head in the range of operation frequency 70-180 Hz.\n",

This paper proposes a novel architecture of\nhigh-selection-speed three-dimensional data registration for inkjet\napplications. With the configuration of three-dimensional data registration,\nthe number of data accessing points as well as the scanning lines can be\ngreatly reduced for large array inkjet printheads with nozzles numbering more\nthan 1000. This IC (Integrated Circuit) architecture involves three-dimensional\nmultiplexing with the provision of a gating transistor for each ink firing\nresistor, where ink firing resistors are triggered only by the selection of\ntheir associated gating transistors. Three signals: selection (S), address (A),\nand power supply (P), are employed together to activate a nozzle for droplet\nejection.

The significance of low temperature hot embossing is to improve\nglobal flatness of embossed devices. This paper reports on experimental studies\nof polymer deformation and relaxation in micro embossing when the process\ntemperatures are below or near its glass transition temperature (Tg). In this\ninvestigation, an indentation system and a micro embosser were used to\ninvestigate the relationship of microstructure formation versus process\ntemperature and load pressure. The depth of indentation was controlled and the\nload force at a certain indentation depth was measured. Experiments were\ncarried out using 1 mm thick PMMA films with the process temperature ranging\nfrom Tg-55 degrees C to Tg +20 degrees C. The embossed structures included a\nsingle micro cavity and groups of micro cavity arrays. It was found that at\ntemperature of Tg-55 degrees C, elastic deformation dominated the formation of\nmicrostructures and significant relaxation happened after embossing. From Tg-20\ndegrees C to Tg, plastic deformation dominated polymer deformation, and\npermanent cavities could be formed on PMMA substrates without obvious\nrelaxation. However, the formation of protrusive structures as micro pillars\nwas not complete since there was little polymer flow. With an increase in\nprocess temperature, microstructure could be formed under lower loading\npressure. Considering the fidelity of a single microstructure and global\nflatness of embossed substrates, micro hot embossing at a low process\ntemperature, but with good fidelity, should be preferred.\n",

Contrary to common\nlogic, the iterative averaging of a system's elements does not result in\nhomogenization of the system; instead, it causes an obligatory subdivision of\nthe system into two alternative subgroups, leaving no outliers. Within each of\nthe formed subgroups, similarity coefficients between the elements reach the\nvalue of 1, whereas similarity coefficients between the elements of different\nsubgroups equal a certain constant value greater than 0 but lower than 1. When\nsubjected to iterative averaging, any system consisting of three or more\nelements of which at least two elements are not completely identical undergo\nsuch a process of bifurcation that occurs non-linearly. Successive iterative\naveraging of each of the forming subgroups eventually provides a hierarchical\nsystem that reflects relationships between the elements of an input system\nunder analysis. We propose a definition of a natural hierarchy that can exist\nonly in conditions of closeness of a system and can be discovered upon\nproviding such an effect onto a system which allows its elements interact with\neach other based on the principle of self-organization. Self-organization can\nbe achieved through an overall and total cross-averaging of a system's\nelements. We demonstrate the application potentials of the proposed technology\non a number of examples, including a system of scattered points, randomized\ndatasets, as well as meteorological and demographical datasets.\n",

The HGV2C\nmethod involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual\nobject that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly\ncreated object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to\nanalyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain\nobject. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and\nits functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and\ninfothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set\nof parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to\nequal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the\npreviously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three\nfunctions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects\nincluding two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the\ngroup into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP\nweight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the\nquery object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter\nvalues, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP\nmultiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A\nrespective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D)\nbetween the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the\ndifference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly\nincreases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases. This new\napproach to knowledge representation is demonstrated on the example of\npopulation pyramids of 220 countries.\n",

And then, the rod could be machined to a\nmiddle-dimension of 20 micrometers by electrolysis. A final desired micro\ndimension can be achieved using supersonic aided electrolysis.\nHigh-aspect-ratio of micro tungsten carbide rod was easily obtained by this\nprocess. Surface roughness of the sample with supersonic aided agitation was\ncompared with that with no agitation in electrolysis. The machined surface of\nthe sample is very smooth due to ionized particles of anode could be removed by\nsupersonic aided agitation during electrolysis. Deep micro holes can also be\nachieved by the machined high-aspect-rati tungsten carbide rod using EDM\nprocess. A micro probe of a ball shape at the end was processed by proposed\nsupersonic aided electrolysis machining process.\n",

The\naim of our research is to pattern large area ceramic green composites using a\nmodified roller laminating apparatus, which is compatible with screen printing\nmachines, for integration of embossing and screen printing. The instrumentation\nof our roller embossing apparatus, as shown in Figure1, consists of roller 1\nand rollers 2. Roller 1 is heated up to the desired embossing temperature ;\nroller 2 is, however, kept at room temperature. The mould is a nickel template\nmanufactured by plating nickel-based micro patterns (height : 50 $\\mu$m) on a\nnickel film (thickness : 70 $\\mu$m) ; the substrate for the roller embossing is\na multilayered Heraeus Heralock HL 2000 ceramic green composite. Comparing with\nthe conventional simultaneous embossing, the advantages of roller embossing\ninclude : (1) low embossing force ; (2) easiness of demoulding ; (3) localized\narea in contact with heater ; and etc. We have demonstrated the capability of\nlarge area roller embossing with a panel size of 150mmx 150mm on the mentioned\nsubstrate. We have explored and confirmed the impact of parameters (feed speed,\ntemperature of roller and applied pressure) to the pattern quality of roller\nembossing. Furthermore, under the optimized process parameters, we\ncharacterized the variations of pattern dimension over the panel area, and\ncalculated a scaling factor in order to make the panel compatible with other\nprocesses.

A commutation between\nthe energy accumulation in the charge pump and the recharge of the buffer\ncapacitor Cres is assured by a switch which is the major bottleneck in the\nenergy harvester circuit. The commutation timing of the switch determines the\nefficiency of the energy harvesting. In previous papers [1] the switch\ncommutates periodically with some fixed duty ratio. However, this solution is\nnot appropriate when the environment parameters, e.g. the vibration frequency,\nchange. We found that the switching should be ordered by the internal state of\nthe circuit, an not by some fixed timing scenario. We presents how to find the\noptimal operation mode of the harvester.

From a comparison of mixing lengths, the results revealed also that\nthe SNR micro-reactor surpassed the SGM in mixing performance by more than 200\n%. As a reaction length is a suitable test of the performance of a reactor, we\nintroduced a redox reaction between ascorbic acid and iodine solutions to\nassess the reaction capability of these micro devices ; the reaction lengths of\nthe SNR micro-reactor were much shorter than those of a SGM.

The\ninherently zero offset of the thermopile is exploited in a feedback loop\ncontrolling the dissipated power in the heater resistors, eliminating\ninevitable influences of resistance drift and mismatch of the thin-film metal\nresistors. The control system cancels the flow-induced temperature difference\nacross the thermopile by controlling a power difference between both heater\nresistors, thereby giving a measure for the flow rate. The flow sensor was\ncharacterised for power difference versus water flow rates up to 1.5 ul/min,\nbeing in good agreement with a thermal model of the sensor, and the correct\nlow-drift operation of the temperature-balancing control system has been\nverified.\n",

Therefore, our interest in this work\nfocus on another parameter affect on the undesirable phenomena as the vortices\nin the Micro-nip. The problem deals with the flow through the Micro-nip of\nmetering size press. The flow enters and exits at a tangential velocity of 20\nm/s between two rollers with diameter 80 cm and 60 -m apart. In the upper and\nbottom part of the domain the angular velocity is 314 rad /s. It has one\nsub-domain. Previous studies focus on the Micro-nip without considering the\ninertia and the viscoelasticity of the material. Roll coating is a technique\ncommonly used in the coating industry to meter a thin fluid film on a moving\nsubstrate. During the film formation, the fluid is subjected to very high shear\nand extensional rates over a very short period of time. The fluid domain\nchanges as a function of the hydrodynamic pressure within the nip as a result\nof the deformable cover usually used on one of the rolls. The free surface also\nadds more complexity to the flow due to the force equilibrium in the fluid gas\ninterface. Last of all, the rheological behavior of the coating fluid is\nusually non-Newtonian, so the metering flow hydrodynamics is finally very\ndifficult to describe. It is concluded that the normal forces of micro-nip\nincreases with increasing the inhibitors. Therefore, it affects on the\nsmoothness and creates defects. On the other hand, it can be concluded that the\ncreation of big vortex in the middle of micro-nip affects on the coating liquid\nbehavior.\n",

This study uses a silicon wafer deposited silicon nitride layers,\nreassembled the gas flow sensor with four cantilever beams that perpendicular\nto each other and manufactured piezoresistive structure on each\nmicro-cantilever by MEMS technologies, respectively. When the cantilever beams\nare formed after etching the silicon wafer, it bends up a little due to the\nreleased residual stress induced in the previous fabrication process. As air\nflows through the sensor upstream and downstream beam deformation was made,\nthus the airflow direction can be determined through comparing the resistance\nvariation between different cantilever beams. The flow rate can also be\nmeasured by calculating the total resistance variations on the four\ncantilevers.\n",

The fully\nmodular ICV-SLID concept allows the formation of multiple device stacks.

As this ability is strongly reduced when an offset\nvoltage is present at the output of the bridge, the proposed architecture\nimplements a feedback loop to control MOS transistors inserted in the\nWheatstone bridge to compensate resistor mismatches.

Reversible circuits are of interest in the design of very low power\ncircuits where energy loss implied by high frequency switching is not of much\nconsideration. Reversibility is essential for Quantum Computing. This paper\nexamines the testability of Reversible Iterative Logic Arrays (ILAs) composed\nof reversible k-CNOT gates. For certain ILAs it is possible to find a test set\nwhose size remains constant irrespective of the size of the ILA, while for\nothers it varies with array size. Former type of ILAs is known as\nConstant-Testable, i.e. C-Testable. It has been shown that Reversible Logic\nArrays are C-Testable and size of test set is equal to number of entries in\ncells truth table implying that the reversible ILAs are also Optimal-Testable,\ni.e. O-Testable. Uniform-Testability, i.e. U-Testability has been defined and\nReversible Heterogeneous ILAs have been characterized as U-Testable. The test\ngeneration problem has been shown to be related to certain properties of cycles\nin a set of graphs derived from cell truth table. By careful analysis of these\ncycles an efficient test generation technique that can be easily converted to\nan ATPG program has been presented for both 1-D and 2D ILAs.

Considerable effort has been\nexpended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope\nwith the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been\naimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In\nthis paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo\nmethod for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method\nis widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing\nyield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not\nbe used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly\nfull circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing\nyield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator,\nbut at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator\nis based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance\nsampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for\ncheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that\nour improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte\nCarlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.\n",

Consequently,\nairport ground operations face critically congested taxiways and long runway\nqueues. In this report, we show how improved management of departure operations\nfrom the ready-to-push-back time to the wheels-off time can potentially yield\nsignificant benefits to airlines and air traffic services. We develop a\nCollaborative Virtual Queue to enable better optimization capabilities during\ncongested situations while taking into account the laissez-faire competitive\nenvironment. Results are evaluated using a departure system model, validated\nusing current statistics and previous studies. First, the Collaborative Virtual\nQueue enables keeping aircraft away from runway queues, which increases\nwheels-off time predictability. Second, holding aircraft enables last-minute\nintra-airline flight switching. This creates new optimization capabilities for\nairlines i.e. it gives airlines the flexibility to prioritize their flight\nsequence in real-time. These capabilities are illustrated by the trade-off\nbetween minimizing the average passenger waiting time and minimizing the level\nof unfairness between aircraft of the same airline. For instance, airlines\ncould choose to decrease by up to 15% their average passenger waiting time by\nprioritizing heavy planes over small planes when the taxiway system is\ncongested.\n",

Scilab is ported to the embedded ARM-Linux system. The drivers\nfor interfacing Scilab with several communication protocols including serial,\nEthernet, and Modbus are developed. Experiments are conducted to test the\ndeveloped embedded platform. The use of Scilab enables implementation of\ncomplex control algorithms on embedded platforms. With the developed platform,\nit is possible to perform all phases of the development cycle of embedded\ncontrol systems in a unified environment, thus facilitating the reduction of\ndevelopment time and cost.\n",

Taking advantage\nof the dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technology, this paper develops a\nperformance-aware power management scheme for embedded controllers with\nprocessors that allow multiple voltage levels. The periods of control tasks are\nadapted online with respect to the current QoC, thus facilitating additional\nenergy reduction over standard DVS. To avoid the waste of CPU resources as a\nresult of the discrete voltage levels, a resource reclaiming mechanism is\nemployed to maximize the CPU utilization and also to improve the QoC.\nSimulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.\nCompared with the optimal standard DVS scheme, the proposed scheme is shown to\nbe able to save remarkably more energy while maintaining comparable QoC.\n",

Therefore a closer look at the impact of ICT in\npublic financial management and performance is highly justified. Public finance\nis defined as a field of economics concerned with paying for collective or\ngovernmental activities, and with the administration and design of those\nactivities. Activities will be viewed as services or more precisely as public\nservices. We believe that there is need to consider performance from the\nperspective of effective performance and the perceived performance. In fact the\nreal or effective performance might not correspond to the perceived\nperformance. A service can be considered from the perspective of the\ndecision-maker, who in our case could be a government or a collectivity. ICT\ncan be employed in the three phases that concern the decision-maker: design,\nimplementation and evaluation. The beneficiaries of a service can employ ICT in\nany of the three phases - awareness, exploitation and assessment - for\nguarantying a high level of efficiency. Each phase in the environment of a\nservice will be presented as well as illustrations of how ICT can be employed\nin order to improve the end-result of each one of them. We believe that a high\nefficiency of each phase will produce a high global efficiency. It should be\nnoted however that the effectiveness of any system is highly dependent on the\nhuman engagement in the system. Therefore, the impact of ICT in public\nfinancial management will be felt only if the decision-makers and the end-users\nof the services engage themselves in the success of the system.

Unlike many existing\nnetwork generating models, our method does not use link probabilities to\nachieve modularity. Instead, it utilizes a user-specified topology to determine\nrelatedness between pairs of nodes in terms of edge distances and links are\nswitched to increase edge distances. To measure the modular-ness of a network\nas a whole, a new metric called Q2 is proposed. Comparisons are made between\nthe Q [15] and Q2 measures. We also comment on the effect of our modularization\nmethod on other network characteristics such as clustering, hierarchy, average\npath length, small-worldness, degree correlation and centrality. An application\nof this method is reported elsewhere [12]. Briefly, the generated networks are\nused as test problems to explore the effect of modularity and degree\ndistribution on evolutionary search algorithms.\n",

In order to reach the best possible performances, it\nis necessary to take into account a maximum of constraints during tool path\ncalculation. For this purpose, we have developed a surface representation of\nthe tool paths to manage 5-axis High Speed Milling, which is the most\ncomplicated case. This model allows integrating early in the step of tool path\ncomputation the machine tool geometrical constraints (axis ranges, part holder\norientation), kinematical constraints (speed and acceleration on the axes,\nsingularities) as well as gouging issues between the tool and the part. The aim\nof the paper is to optimize the step of 5-axis HSM tool path calculation with a\nbi-parameter surface representation of the tool path. We propose an example of\nintegration of the digital process for tool path computation, ensuring the\nrequired quality and maximum productivity\n",

These sites are Ajaccio (seaside),\nBastia (seaside) and Corte (average altitude of 486 meters). This lack of\nweather station makes difficult the predictability of PV power grid\nperformance. This work intends to study a methodology which can predict global\nsolar irradiation using data available from another location for daily and\nhourly horizon. In order to achieve this prediction, we have used Artificial\nNeural Network which is a popular artificial intelligence technique in the\nforecasting domain. A simulator has been obtained using data available for the\nstation of Ajaccio that is the only station for which we have a lot of data: 16\nyears from 1972 to 1987. Then we have tested the efficiency of this simulator\nin two places with different geographical features: Corte, a mountainous region\nand Bastia, a coastal region. On daily horizon, the relocation has implied\nfewer errors than a naive prediction method based on the persistence (RMSE=1468\nVs 1383Wh/m2 to Bastia and 1325 Vs 1213Wh/m2 to Corte). On hourly case, the\nresults were still satisfactory, and widely better than persistence (RMSE=138.8\nVs 109.3 Wh/m2 to Bastia and 135.1 Vs 114.7 Wh/m2 to Corte). The last\nexperiment was to evaluate the accuracy of our simulator on a PV power grid\nlocalized at 10 km from the station of Ajaccio.

Prostate tracking makes it possi- ble to overcome several\ndrawbacks of the current standard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy\nprocedure, namely the insufficient targeting accuracy which may lead to a\nbiopsy distribution of poor quality, the very approximate knowledge about the\nactual location of the sampled tissues which makes it difficult to implement\nfocal therapy strategies based on biopsy results, and finally the difficulty to\nprecisely reach non-ultrasound (US) targets stemming from different modalities,\nstatistical atlases or previous biopsy series. The prostate tracking systems\npresented so far are limited to rigid transformation tracking. However, the\ngland can get considerably deformed during the intervention because of US probe\npres- sure and patient movements. We propose to use 3D US combined with\nimage-based elastic registration to estimate these deformations. A fast elastic\nregistration algorithm that copes with the frequently occurring US shadows is\npresented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We\nevaluated 23 surgeons' accuracy inserting a guide-wire in a human cadaver\nexperiment, following a pre-established procedure. These medical trainees were\ndefined in three prospective respects: novice or skilled; with or without\ntheoretical knowledge; with or without surgical procedure familiarity. Analysed\ncriteria for each tested surgeon included the number of intraoperative X-rays\ntaken in order to achieve the surgical procedure as well as an iatrogenic index\nreflecting the surgeon's ability to detect any hazardous trajectory at the time\nof performing said procedure. RESULTS: An average number of 13 X-rays was\nrequired for wire implantation by the G1 group. G2 group, assisted by the\nsimulator use, required an average of 10 X-rays. A substantial difference was\nespecially observed within the novice sub-group (N), with an average of 12.75\nX-rays for the G1 category and an average of 8.5 X-rays for the G2 category.

In this paper, we propose a new approach in\ndetecting cross language plagiarism. Our web based cross language plagiarism\ndetection system is specially tuned to detect translation plagiarism by\nimplementing different techniques and tools to assist the detection process.\nGoogle Translate API is used as our translation tool and Google Search API,\nwhich is used in our information retrieval process. Our system is also\nintegrated with the fingerprint matching technique, which is a widely used\nplagiarism detection technique. In general, our proposed system is started by\ntranslating the input documents from Malay to English, followed by removal of\nstop words and stemming words, identification of similar documents in corpus,\ncomparison of similar pattern and finally summary of the result. Three\nleast-frequent 4-grams fingerprint matching is used to implement the core\ncomparison phase during the plagiarism detection process. In K-gram fingerprint\nmatching technique, although any value of K can be considered, yet K = 4 was\nstated as an ideal choice. This is because smaller values of K (i.e., K = 1, 2,\nor 3), do not provide good discrimination between sentences. On the other hand,\nthe larger the values of K (i.e., K = 5, 6, 7...etc), the better discrimination\nof words in one sentence from words in another.\n",

The essential requirement is that the sequence is uncorrelated with\nthe decision space topology, so that its effect is to pseudorandomly distribute\nprobes throughout the landscape. While this process may appear to be similar to\nthe randomness in an inherently stochastic algorithm, it is in fact\nfundamentally different because CFO remains deterministic at every step. Three\npseudorandom methods are discussed (initial probe distribution, repositioning\nfactor, and decision space adaptation).

OFDM is very effective in combating\nintersymbol interference and can achieve high data rate in frequency selective\nchannel. For OFDM communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio\nchannels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in Inter\nCarrier Interference (ICI). ICI causes power leakage among subcarriers thus\ndegrading the system performance. A wellknown problem of OFDM is its\nsensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier\nfrequencies. There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset one\nis the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to\neach of the carriers and the second is introduction of ICI from the other\ncarriers. This research work investigates three effective methods for combating\nthe effects of ICI: ICI Self Cancellation (SC), Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nestimation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method. These three methods are\ncompared in terms of bit error rate performance and bandwidth efficiency.\nThrough simulations, it is shown that the three techniques are effective in\nmitigating the modulation schemes, the ML and EKF methods perform better than\nthe SC method.\n",

From the latter, there are values limiting those parameters. The\nbeginning of a tolerancing process is in this duality. As high precision\nassemblies cannot be analyzed with the assumption that form errors are\nnegligible, we propose to apply this process to assemblies with form errors\nthrough a new way of allowing to parameterize forms and solve their assemblies.\nThe assembly process is calculated through a method of allowing to solve the 3D\nassemblies of pairs of surfaces having form errors using a static equilibrium.\nWe have built a geometrical model based on the modal shapes of the ideal\nsurface. We compute for the completely deterministic contact points between\nthis pair of shapes according to a given assembly process. The solution gives\nan accurate evaluation of the assembly performance. Then we compare the results\nwith or without taking into account the form errors. When we analyze a batch of\nassemblies, the problem is to compute for the nonconformity rate of a pilot\nproduction according to the functional requirements. We input probable errors\nof surfaces (position, orientation, and form) in our calculus and we evaluate\nthe quality of the results compared with the functional requirements. The pilot\nproduction then can or cannot be validated.\n",

The modal\ncharacterisation is used to describe the form deviation of a geometry as the\ncombination of elementary deviations (location, orientation and form).

We proposed\nto realize a global optimization of a deep drawing industrial progression (made\nof several stages) for a cup manufacture. The objectives of the process were\nthe thickness decrease and the geometrical parameters (especially the height).\nThis paper improves on this previous work in the aim of mastering the contour\nerror. From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the\nneeded material and the number of forming operations. Our action is focused on\nthe appearance of unexpected undulations (ears) located on the rim of the cups\nduring forming due to a nonuniform crystallographic texture. Those undulations\ncan cause a significant amount of scraps, productivity loss, and cost during\nmanufacture. In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming\noperations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two\nforming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is\nto reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed\nmaterial (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in\ndefining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and\nthen simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine\ntransformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming\noperation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links\nbetween the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients. An optimization is then\npossible by using mathematical links. This original approach leads the ears'\namplitude to be reduced by a factor of 10, with only 15 numerical experiments.\nMoreover, we have limited the number of forming stages from 4 to 2 with a\nminimal material use.\n",

This paper presents an intelligent system\nto detect the presence of forest fires in the forest spatial data using\nArtificial Neural Networks. The digital images in the forest spatial data are\nconverted from RGB to XYZ color space and then segmented by employing\nanisotropic diffusion to identify the fire regions.

This enables the possibility of enhancing the system's\nperformance by deploying adaptive mechanisms, namely power distribution and\ndynamic sub-carrier assignments. The performances of maximizing the minimum\nthroughput have been analyzed by MATLAB codes.\n",

        "summary": "  The property that every control system should posses is stability, which\ntranslates into safety in real-life applications. A central tool in systems\ntheory for synthesizing control laws that achieve stability are control\nLyapunov functions (CLFs). Classically, a CLF enforces that the resulting\nclosed-loop state trajectory is contained within a cone with a fixed,\npredefined shape, and which is centered at and converges to a desired\nconverging point. However, such a requirement often proves to be\noverconservative, which is why most of the real-time controllers do not have a\nstability guarantee. Recently, a novel idea that improves the design of CLFs in\nterms of flexibility was proposed. The focus of this new approach is on the\ndesign of optimization problems that allow certain parameters that define a\ncone associated with a standard CLF to be decision variables. In this way\nnon-monotonicity of the CLF is explicitly linked with a decision variable that\ncan be optimized on-line. Conservativeness is significantly reduced compared to\nclassical CLFs, which makes \\emph{flexible CLFs} more suitable for\nstabilization of constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems and real-time\ncontrol. The purpose of this overview is to highlight the potential of flexible\nCLFs for real-time control of fast mechatronic systems, with sampling periods\nbelow one millisecond, which are widely employed in aerospace and automotive\napplications.\n",

The design is scalable:\nall species of DNA strands can in principle be mixed and prepared in a single\ntest tube, rather than requiring separate purification of each species, which\nis a barrier to large-scale synthesis. The design is time-responsive: the\nconcentration of output species changes in response to the concentration of\ninput species, so that time-varying inputs may be continuously processed. The\ndesign is digital: Boolean values of wires in the circuit are represented as\nhigh or low concentrations of certain species, and we show how to construct a\nsingle-input, single-output signal restoration gate that amplifies the\ndifference between high and low, which can be distributed to each wire in the\ncircuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital\nabstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is\nenergy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0\nconcentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal\nconcentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic)\nequilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until\nthe input again changes.\n  Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided\nnon-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy\nmust be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at\nsteady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are\npermanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not \"generic\"; each gate\nin the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence\ndifferent circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we\nrequire input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an\ninput of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by\nthe presence of another. That is, we do not construct a \"true NOT gate\" that\nsets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration\nis low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive,\ndigital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of\nthese problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually\nincompatible.\n",

The unique behaviour of the MOS transistors in subthreshold\nregion not only allows a designer to work at low input bias current but also at\nlow voltage. While operating the device at weak inversion results low power\ndissipation but dynamic range is degraded. Optimum balance between power\ndissipation and dynamic range results when the MOS transistors are operated at\nmoderate inversion. Power is again minimised by the application of input\ndependant bias current using feedback loops in the input transistors of the\ndifferential pair with two current substractors. In comparison with the\nreported low power low voltage opamps at 0.8 micron technology, this opamp has\nvery low standby power consumption with a high driving capability and operates\nat low voltage. The opamp is fairly small (0.0084 mm 2) and slew rate is more\nthan other low power low voltage opamps reported at 0.8 um technology [1,2].\nVittoz at al [3] reported that slew rate can be improved by adaptive biasing\ntechnique and power dissipation can be reduced by operating the device in weak\ninversion. Though lower power dissipation is achieved the area required by the\ncircuit is very large and speed is too small. So, operating the device in\nmoderate inversion is a good solution.

Basically the principle of sub- threshold logics is\noperating MOSFET in sub-threshold region and using the leakage current in that\nregion for switching action, there by drastically decreasing power. To reduce\nthe power consumption of sub-threshold circuits further, a novel body biasing\ntechnique termed VTMOS is introduced .VTMOS approach is realized from DTMOS\napproach. Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) circuits provide low leakage and high\ncurrent drive, compared to CMOS circuits, operated at lower voltages. The VTMOS\nis based on operating the MOS devices with an appropriate substrate bias which\nvaries with gate voltage, by connecting a positive bias voltage between gate\nand substrate for NMOS and negative bias voltage between gate and substrate for\nPMOS. With VTMOS, there is a considerable reduction in operating current and\npower dissipation, while the remaining characteristics are almost the same as\nthose of DTMOS. Results of our investigations show that VTMOS circuits improves\nthe power up to 50% when compared to CMOS and DTMOS circuits, in sub- threshold\nregion.. The performance analysis and comparison of VTMOS, DTMOS and CMOS is\nmade and test results of Power dissipation, Propagation delay and Power delay\nproduct are presented to justify the superiority of VTMOS logic over\nconventional sub-threshold logics using Hspice Tool. The dependency of these\nparameters on frequency of operation has also been investigated.\n",

This is to say that, a situation may arise that some\nservices might not have all that the user specifies but are rated high in those\nthey have. With some tradeoffs specified in form of weight, these services will\nbe made available to the user for consideration. This assertion is from the\nfact that, the user's requirements for the specified QoS properties are of\nvarying degree i.e. he will always prefer one ahead of the other. This can be\ncaptured in form of weight i.e. the one preferred most will have the highest\nweight. If a consumer specifies light weight for those QoS properties that a\nweb service is deficient in and high weight for those it has, this will\nminimize the difference between them.

CAM software can help in estimating that time for a given strategy.\nBut in practice, CAM-programmed feed rates are rarely achieved, especially\nwhere complex surface finishing is concerned. This means that machining time\nforecasts are often more than one step removed from reality. The reason behind\nthis is that CAM routines do not take either the dynamic performances of the\nmachines or their specific machining tolerances into account. The present\narticle seeks to improve simulation of high-speed NC machine dynamic behaviour\nand machining time prediction, offering two models. The first contributes\nthrough enhanced simulation of three-axis paths in linear and circular\ninterpolation, taking high-speed machine accelerations and jerks into account.\nThe second model allows transition passages between blocks to be integrated in\nthe simulation by adding in a polynomial transition path that caters for the\ntrue machining environment tolerances. Models are based on respect for path\nmonitoring. Experimental validation shows the contribution of polynomial\nmodelling of the transition passage due to the absence of a leap in\nacceleration.

Space\nmapping is a powerful technique to optimize such complex models by efficiently\nsubstituting accurate but expensive electromagnetic models, fine models, with\nfast and approximate models, coarse models.

        "summary": "  Central Force Optimization is a global search and optimization algorithm that\nsearches a decision space by flying \"probes\" whose trajectories are\ndeterministically computed using two equations of motion. Because it is\npossible for a probe to fly outside the domain of feasible solutions, a simple\nerrant probe retrieval method has been used previously that does not include\nthe directional information contained in a probe's acceleration vector. This\nnote investigates the effect of adding directionality to the \"repositioning\nfactor\" approach. As a general proposition, it appears that doing so does not\nimprove convergence speed or accuracy. In fact, adding directionality to the\noriginal errant probe retrieval scheme appears to be highly inadvisable.\nNevertheless, there may be alternative probe retrieval schemes that do benefit\nfrom directional information, and the results reported here may assist in or\nencourage their development.\n",

A task generates jobs that can be\ngiven arbitrary service times before their deadlines. A task then obtains\nrewards based on the service times received by its jobs. We show that this\nmodel is compatible to the imprecise computation models and the increasing\nreward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these\nmodels, which mainly focus on maximize the total reward in the system, we aim\nto fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks, which offers\nbetter fairness and allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive\na necessary and sufficient condition for a system, along with reward\nrequirements of tasks, to be feasible. We also obtain an off-line feasibility\noptimal scheduling policy. We then studies a sufficient condition for a policy\nto be feasibility optimal or achieves some approximation bound. This condition\ncan serve as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtains\na greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility\noptimal when all tasks have the same periods and also obtain an approximation\nbound for the policy under general cases.\n",

It uses the instantaneous value of the square of the error signal\nas an estimate of the mean-square error (MSE). The LMS algorithm changes\n(adapts) the filter tap weights so that the error signal is minimized in the\nmean square sense. In Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS), two\nnew versions of LMS algorithms, same formulations are performed as in the LMS\nalgorithm with the exception that filter tap weights are now expressed using\ntrigonometric and hyperbolic formulations, in cases for TLMS and HLMS\nrespectively. Hence appears the CORDIC algorithm as it can efficiently perform\ntrigonometric, hyperbolic, linear and logarithmic functions. While\nhardware-efficient algorithms often exist, the dominance of the software\nsystems has kept those algorithms out of the spotlight. Among these hardware-\nefficient algorithms, CORDIC is an iterative solution for trigonometric and\nother transcendental functions. Former researches worked on CORDIC algorithm to\nobserve the convergence behavior of Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) algorithm and\nobtained a satisfactory result in the context of convergence performance of\nTLMS algorithm. But revious researches directly used the CORDIC block output in\ntheir simulation ignoring the internal step-by-step rotations of the CORDIC\nprocessor. This gives rise to a need for verification of the convergence\nperformance of the TLMS algorithm to investigate if it actually performs\nsatisfactorily if implemented with step-by-step CORDIC rotation. This research\nwork has done this job. It focuses on the internal operations of the CORDIC\nhardware, implements the Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS)\nalgorithms using actual CORDIC rotations. The obtained simulation results are\nhighly satisfactory and also it shows that convergence behavior of HLMS is much\nbetter than TLMS.\n",

        "summary": "  The ARMrayan Multimedia Mobile CMS (Content Management System) is the first\nmobile CMS that gives the opportunity to users for creating multimedia J2ME\nmobile applications with their desired content, design and logo; simply,\nwithout any need for writing even a line of code. The low-level programming and\ncompatibility problems of the J2ME, along with UI designing difficulties, makes\nit hard for most people -even programmers- to broadcast their content to the\nwidespread mobile phones used by nearly all people. This system provides\nuser-friendly, PC-based tools for creating a tree index of pages and inserting\nmultiple multimedia contents (e.g. sound, video and picture) in each page for\ncreating a J2ME mobile application. The output is a stand-alone Java mobile\napplication that has a user interface, shows texts and pictures and plays music\nand videos regardless of the type of devices used as long as the devices\nsupport the J2ME platform. Bitmap fonts have also been used thus Middle Eastern\nlanguages can be easily supported on all mobile phone devices. We omitted\nprogramming concepts for users in order to simplify multimedia content-oriented\nmobile application designing for use in educational, cultural or marketing\ncenters. Ordinary operators can now create a variety of multimedia mobile\napplications such as tutorials, catalogues, books, and guides in minutes rather\nthan months. Simplicity and power has been the goal of this CMS. In this paper,\nwe present the software engineered-designed concepts of the ARMrayan MCMS along\nwith the implementation challenges faces and solutions adapted.\n",

Finally the designed mobile\napplication was implemented and the important sections of it were described,\nsuch as the interactive house top view map which indicates the status of the\ndevices using predefined icons. The facilities to manage the scheduled tasks\nand defined rules are also implemented in this mobile application that was\ndeveloped for use in Windows Mobile platform.

It minimizes the number of tests to be performed to\ndetermine the genuinity of the circuit. The main idea behind the present\nresearch work is to identify the maximum number of indistinguishable faults\npresent in the given circuit and minimize the number of test cases based on the\nnumber of faults that has been detected. Heuristic approach is used for test\nminimization part, which identifies the essential tests from overall test\ncases. From the results it is observed that, test minimization varies from 50%\nto 99% with the lowest one corresponding to a circuit with four gates .Test\nminimization is low in case of circuits with lesser input leads in gates\ncompared to greater input leads in gates for the boolean expression with same\nnumber of symbols. Achievement of 99% reduction is due to the fact that the\nlarge number of tests find the same faults. The new approach is implemented for\nsimple circuits. The results show potential for both smaller test sets and\nlower cpu times.\n",

With the rapid increase in the capacity and size of\ndata centers, there is a continuous increase in the demand for energy\nconsumption. These data centers not only consume a tremendous amount of energy\nbut are riddled with IT inefficiencies. All data center are plagued with\nthousands of servers as major components. These servers consume huge energy\nwithout performing useful work. In an average server environment, 30% of the\nservers are \"dead\" only consuming energy, without being properly utilized.\nTheir utilization ratio is only 5 to 10 percent. This paper focuses on the use\nof an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient\ndata centers by providing a solution called server consolidation. It increases\nthe utilization ratio up to 50% saving huge amount of energy. Server\nconsolidation helps in implementing green data centers to ensure that IT\ninfrastructure contributes as little as possible to the emission of green house\ngases, and helps to regain power and cooling capacity, recapture resilience and\ndramatically reducing energy costs and total cost of ownership.\n",

The tool set proposed by these architecture frameworks connects\noperational views of the military user, system views of the developers, and the\ntechnical views for standards and integration methods needed to make the\nnetwork centric system of systems work. The tools are therefore logically a\nvaluable backbone for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A).

A major setback is that squeezed logic variables\nare unable to work in the hyperspace, because the logic-low zero value sets the\nhyperspace product vector to zero. This paper proposes Boolean universal logic\ngates that alleviate such shortcomings. They are able to work with non-squeezed\nlogic values where both the high and low values are encoded into nonzero,\nbipolar, independent random telegraph waves. Non-squeezed universal Boolean\nlogic gates for spike-based brain logic are also shown. The advantages vs.\ndisadvantages of the two logic types are compared.\n",

The\nmotivation of each pedestrian is to leave the facility. The events used to\nredirect pedestrians include the identification of a jam situation and/or\nidentification of a better route than the current. This study considers two\ntypes of pedestrians: familiar and unfamiliar with the facility. Four\nstrategies are modelled to cover those groups. The modelled strategies are the\nshortest path (local and global); They are combined with a quickest path\napproach, which is based on an observation principle. In the quickest path\napproach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment\nand are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit\nanalysis function. The dynamic modelling of route choice with different\nstrategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of in uences which\nappears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an\nevacuation process. To address this question criteria are elaborated. The\ncriteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time, the\nindividual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size\nitself. The in uences of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria\nare investigated. The sensibility of the system to disturbances (e.g. broken\nescape route) is also analysed.

        "summary": "  Noise problems in signals have gained huge attention due to the need of\nnoise-free output signal in numerous communication systems. The principal of\nadaptive noise cancellation is to acquire an estimation of the unwanted\ninterfering signal and subtract it from the corrupted signal. Noise\ncancellation operation is controlled adaptively with the target of achieving\nimproved signal to noise ratio. This paper concentrates upon the analysis of\nadaptive noise canceller using Recursive Least Square (RLS), Fast Transversal\nRecursive Least Square (FTRLS) and Gradient Adaptive Lattice (GAL) algorithms.\nThe performance analysis of the algorithms is done based on convergence\nbehavior, convergence time, correlation coefficients and signal to noise ratio.\nAfter comparing all the simulated results we observed that GAL performs the\nbest in noise cancellation in terms of Correlation Coefficient, SNR and\nConvergence Time. RLS, FTRLS and GAL were never evaluated and compared before\non their performance in noise cancellation in terms of the criteria we\nconsidered here.\n",

A solution to overcome this problem is to design\nthe beamforming vector using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the\nreceiver to the transmitter. In the case of limited feedback, the beamforming\nvector is limited to lie in a codebook that is known to both the transmitter\nand receiver.When the feedback is strictly limited, important issues are how to\nquantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in\nassociated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback\navailable.In this paper channel quantization schema using simple approach to\ncodebook design (random vector quantization)is illustrated. Performance results\nshow that even with a few bits of feedback, performance can be close to that\nwith perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter.\n",

        "summary": "  Recent evolutions on forging process induce more complex shape on forging\ndie. These evolutions, combined with High Speed Machining (HSM) process of\nforging die lead to important increase in time for machining preparation. In\nthis context, an original approach for generating machining process based on\nmachining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core of this approach is to\ndecompose a CAD model of complex forging die in geometric features.\nTechnological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric\nfeature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as\nmaterial, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging\nprocess and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and\nmachining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between\nthe surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining features identification\ncutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of forging die,\nare associated to them in order to generate machining sequences. A machining\nprocess model is proposed to formalize the links between information imbedded\nin the machining features and the parameters of cutting tools and machining\nstrategies. At last machining sequences are grouped and ordered to generate the\ncomplete die machining process. In this paper the identification of geometrical\nfeatures is detailed. Geometrical features identification is based on machining\nknowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL\nmodels. A map based on the contact area between cutting tools and die shape\ngives basic geometrical features which are connected or not according to the\ncontinuity maps. The proposed approach is illustrated by an application on an\nindustrial study case which was accomplished as part of collaboration.\n",

In this context,\nparallel proximal algorithms and related alternating direction methods of\nmultipliers have become popular optimization techniques to approximate\niteratively the desired solution. Until now, in most of these methods, either\nLipschitz differentiability properties or tight frame representations were\nassumed. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to relax these\nassumptions by considering a class of non necessarily tight frame\nrepresentations, thus offering the possibility of addressing a broader class of\nsignal restoration problems. In particular, it is possible to use non\nnecessarily maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction, which\nare common tools in digital signal processing. The proposed approach allows us\nto solve both frame analysis and frame synthesis problems for various noise\ndistributions. In our simulations, it is applied to the deconvolution of data\ncorrupted with Poisson noise or Laplacian noise by using (non-tight) discrete\ndual-tree wavelet representations and filter bank structures.\n",

It helps an organization\nin saving costs and creating new business opportunities.This paper provides a\nframework, Education Cloud for the e- management of NGO's. The Education Cloud\ncan transform a nonprofit, or an entire sector of nonprofits, achieves its\nmission and creates lasting impact in its communities. This paper also presents\nthe case study of Kalgidhar trust, Baru Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, NGO which is\nusing the education as the tool to solve the social issues.\n",

As feed drives are one part of the set Machine tool - Numerical\nController, it is necessary to improve their performances to optimize feed\ndrive dynamics during trajectory follow up. Hence, this paper deals with the\nmodelling of the feed drive in the case of multi axis machining. This model can\nbe used for the simulation of axis dynamics and tool-path tracking to tune\nparameters and optimize new frameworks of command strategies. A procedure of\nidentification based on modern NC capabilities is presented and applied to\nindustrial HSM centres. Efficiency of this modelling is assessed by\nexperimental verifications on various representative trajectories. After\nimplementing a Generalized Predictive Control, reliable simulations are\nperformed thanks to the model. These simulations can then be used to tune\nparameters of this new framework according to the tool-path geometry.\n",

The machine encoder signals are also compared to the actual\ntool center point position as recorded with a non-contact measuring instrument\ncalled CapBall to evaluate the total geometric errors.

The evolution of the respective contributions for\ncontouring errors, quasi-static geometric errors and dynamic geomet- ric errors\nis experimentally evaluated and a relation between programmed feed rate and\ndynamic errors is highlighted.\n",

To this end, we propose and implement our design approach to\nreconfiguration to manage invalid bindings.

Our model's\nparameters are derived from a unique data set provided by a large food bank and\nfood rescue organization in north central Colorado. We find that food supply is\na non-parametric heavy-tailed process that is well-modeled with an extreme\nvalue peaks-over-threshold model. Although the underlying process is\nstochastic, the basic approach of food rescue and redistribution appears to be\nfeasible both at small and large scales. The ultimate efficacy of this model is\nintimately tied to the rate at which food expires and hence the ability to\npreserve and quickly transport and redistribute food. The cost of the\nredistribution is tied to the number and density of participating suppliers,\nand costs can be reduced (and supply increased) simply by recruiting additional\ndonors to participate. Our results show that with sufficient funding and\nmanpower, a significant amount of food can be rescued from the waste stream and\nused to feed the hungry.\n",

Within CES bio-inspired systems play a key role. The disclosure\nfrom bio-inspired systems and biological computation has not been sufficiently\nworked out, however. Biological computation is to be taken as the processing of\ninformation by living systems that is carried out in polynomial time, i.e.,\nefficiently; such processing however is grasped by current science and research\nas an intractable problem (for instance, the protein folding problem). A remark\nis needed here: P versus NP problems should be well defined and delimited but\nbiological computation problems are not. The shift from conventional\nengineering to bio-inspired engineering needs bring the subject (or problem) of\ncomputability to a new level. Within the frame of computation, so far, the\nprevailing paradigm is still the Turing-Church thesis. In other words,\nconventional engineering is still ruled by the Church-Turing thesis (CTt).\nHowever, CES is ruled by CTt, too. Contrarily to the above, we shall argue here\nthat biological computation demands a more careful thinking that leads us\ntowards hypercomputation. Bio-inspired engineering and CES thereafter, must\nturn its regard toward biological computation. Thus, biological computation can\nand should be taken as the ground for engineering complex non-linear systems.\nBiological systems do compute in terms of hypercomputation, indeed. If so, then\nthe focus is not algorithmic or computational complexity but\ncomputation-beyond-the-Church-Turing-barrier. We claim that we need a new\ncomputational theory that encompasses biological processes wherein the\nTuring-Church thesis is but a particular case.\n",

The fossil fuel is considered insufficient thus solar\nenergy systems are becoming more and more useful, not only in terms of\ninstallation but monitoring of these systems is very crucial. Monitoring\nbecomes very important when there are a large number of solar panels.\nMonitoring would allow early detection if the output falls below required level\nor one of the solar panel out of 1000 goes down. In this study the target is to\nmonitor and control a developed solar panel by using available internet\nfoundation. This web-enabled software will provide more flexibility over the\nsystem such as transmitting data from panel to the host computer and\ndisseminating information to relevant stake holders barring any geographical\nbarrier. The software would be built around web server with dynamic HTML and\nJAVA, this paper presents the preliminary design of the proposed system.\n",

From the study of evolution of numerous earlier\nprocessors, we derive the basis for the architecture of MPUs. These specialized\nprocessors perform unique medical functions encoded as medical operational\ncodes (mopcs). From a pragmatic perspective, MPUs function very close to CPUs.\nBoth processors have unique operation codes that command the hardware to\nperform a distinct chain of subprocesses upon operands and generate a specific\nresult unique to the opcode and the operand(s). In medical environments, MPU\ndecodes the mopcs and executes a series of medical sub-processes and sends out\nsecondary commands to the medical machine. Whereas operands in a typical\ncomputer system are numerical and logical entities, the operands in medical\nmachine are objects such as such as patients, blood samples, tissues, operating\nrooms, medical staff, medical bills, patient payments, etc. We follow the\nfunctional overlap between the two processes and evolve the design of medical\ncomputer systems and networks.\n",

To evaluate the requirements of such a\nsystem in terms of sensors and signal processing we compare two designs. The\nfirst one uses only one scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) electrode and the\npower in the alpha frequency band. The second one uses sixteen scalp EEG\nelectrodes and machine learning methods. The role of muscular activity is also\nevaluated using five electrodes positioned on the face and the neck. Results\nshow that the first design enabled 70% of the participants to successfully\ncontrol the game, whereas 100% of the participants managed to do it with the\nsecond design based on machine learning. Subjective questionnaires confirm\nthese results: users globally felt to have control in both designs, with an\nincreased feeling of control in the second one. Offline analysis of face and\nneck muscle activity shows that this activity could also be used to distinguish\nbetween relaxation and concentration tasks. Results suggest that the\ncombination of muscular and brain activity could improve performance of this\nkind of system. They also suggest that muscular activity has probably been\nrecorded by EEG electrodes.\n",

The\nservices of Software Quality Analyst (SQA) from different vendors were\nleveraged to facilitate implementation of processes which was referred to as\nthe Quality Management System (QMS). To co-ordinate and support QMS\nimplementation, a Software Quality Assurance Group (SQAG) was established at\nthe organizational level. Considering the large number of applications, the\nbusiness verticals proposed that process implementation should be owned and\nmanaged by practitioners themselves so that the mass deployment of QMS can be\nachieved at a faster rate with the same SQA capacity.

Number of nodes present and void\noccurrence in the different forwarding zones have also been analysed based on\nvarious node density in the network to determine the successful delivery of\ndata. Our analytical results show that in a densely populated network, data can\nbe transmitted with low radio transmission range.

Business requirements always change.\nLikewise, IT systems constantly evolves as developers make new versions of\nthem, which require endless administrative manual work to customize and\nconfigure them, especially if they are being used in different contexts, by\ndifferent types of users, and for different requirements. Autonomic computing\nwas conceived to provide an answer to these ever-changing requirements.\nEssentially, autonomic systems are self-configuring, self-healing,\nself-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate all complex IT\nprocesses without human intervention. This paper proposes an autonomic model\nbased on Venn diagram and set theory for self-configuring C#.NET applications,\nnamely the self-customization of their GUI, event-handlers, and security\npermissions. The proposed model does not require altering the source-code of\nthe original application; rather, it uses an XML-based customization file to\nturn on and off the internal attributes of the application. Experiments\nconducted on the proposed model, showed a successful automatic customization\nfor C# applications and an effective self-adaption based on dynamic business\nrequirements. As future work, other programming languages such as Java and C++\nare to be supported, in addition to other operating systems such as Linux and\nMac so as to provide a standard platform-independent autonomic self-configuring\nmodel.\n",

After discussion of the specific requirements,\ndifferent LDOs are recommended. Also, some LDO design techniques are briefly\ndiscussed to demonstrate how an LDO may be optimized for a specific level of\nperformance. Cellular phone designs require linear regulators with lowdropout,\nlow-noise, high PSRR, low quiescent current (Iq), and low-cost.

Boundary of\nvolumes (henceforth envelope) obtained by sweeping solids have been extensively\ninvestigated in the past, though, obtaining an accurate parametrization of the\nenvelope remained computationally hard. The present work reports our approach\nto this problem as well as the important problem of identifying\nself-intersections within the envelope. Parametrization of the envelope is, of\ncourse, necessary for its use in most current CAD systems. We take the more\ninteresting case when the solid is composed of several faces meeting smoothly.\nWe show that the face structure of the envelope mimics locally that of the\nsolid. We adopt the procedural approach at defining the geometry in this work\nwhich has the advantage of being accurate as well as computationally efficient.\nThe problem of detecting local self-intersections is central to a robust\nimplementation of the solid sweep. This has been addressed by computing a\nsubtle mathematical invariant which detects self-intersections, and which is\ncomputationally benign and requires only point queries.\n",

Previous studies\nhave reported that under specific conditions, i.e. when a random train of\nPoissonian distributed spikes are used as inputs, and weight changes occur\naccording to STDP, it has been shown that the BCM rule is an emergent property.\nHere, the applied STDP rule can be either classical pair-based STDP rule, or\nthe more powerful triplet-based STDP rule. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nuse of two distinct VLSI circuit implementations of STDP to examine whether BCM\nlearning is an emergent property of STDP. These circuits are stimulated with\nrandom Poissonian spike trains. The first circuit implements the classical\npair-based STDP, while the second circuit realizes a previously described\ntriplet-based STDP rule. These two circuits are simulated using 0.35 um CMOS\nstandard model in HSpice simulator. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed triplet-based STDP circuit significantly produces the threshold-based\nbehaviour of the BCM. Also, the results testify to similar behaviour for the\nVLSI circuit for pair-based STDP in generating the BCM.\n",

During RF transmission energy\nconsumed by critically energy-constrained sensor nodes in a WSN is related to\nthe life time system, but the life time of the system is inversely proportional\nto the energy consumed by sensor nodes. In that regard, modulated\nbackscattering (MB) is a promising design choice, in which sensor nodes send\ntheir data just by switching their antenna impedance and reflecting the\nincident signal coming from an RF source. Hence wireless passive sensor\nnetworks (WPSN) designed to operate using MB do not have the lifetime\nconstraints. In this we are going to investigate the system analytically.

This paper describes the various components of\nour prototype implementation of a Real-time Passenger Information System\n(RTPIS) for a public transport system like a fleet of buses. Vehicle-mounted\nunits, bus station units and a server located at the transport company premises\ncomprise the system. The vehicle unit reports the current position of the\nvehicle to a central server periodically via General Packet Radio Service\n(GPRS). An Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) algorithm running on the server\npredicts the arrival times of buses at their stops based on real-time\nobservations of the buses' current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates.\nThis information is displayed and announced to passengers at stops using\nstation units, which periodically fetch the required ETA from the server via\nGPRS. Novel features of our prototype include: (a) a route creator utility\nwhich automatically creates new routes from scratch when a bus is driven along\nthe new route, and (b) voice tagging of stops and points of interest along any\nroute. Besides, the prototype provides: (i) web-based applications for\npassengers, providing useful information like a snapshot of present bus\nlocations on the streets, and (ii) web-based analysis tools for the transport\nauthority, providing information useful for fleet management, like number of\ntrips undertaken by a specific bus. The prototype has been demonstrated in a\ncampus environment, with four-wheelers and two-wheelers emulating buses. The\nautomatic real-time passenger information system has the potential of making\nthe public transport system an attractive alternative for city-dwellers,\nthereby contributing to fewer private vehicles on the road, leading to lower\ncongestion levels and less pollution.\n",

The objective is to minimize\nthe length of the strip. An iterated tabu search approach, named ITS, is\nproposed. ITS starts from a randomly generated solution and attempts to gain\nimprovements by a tabu search procedure. After that, if the obtained solution\nis not feasible, a perturbation operator is subsequently employed to\nreconstruct the incumbent solution and an acceptance criterion is implemented\nto determine whether or not accept the perturbed solution. This process is\nrepeated until a feasible solution has been found or the allowed computation\ntime has been elapsed. Computational experiments based on well-known benchmark\ninstances show that ITS produces quite competitive results with respect to the\nbest known results. For 18 representative CODP instances taken from the\nliterature, ITS succeeds in improving 13 best known results within reasonable\ntime. In addition, for another challenging related variant: the problem of\npacking arbitrary sized circles into a circular container, ITS also succeeds in\nimproving many best known results. Supplementary experiments are also provided\nto analyze the influence of the perturbation operator, as well as the\nacceptance criterion.\n",

Several variations of their\ncurvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or\nthe machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of\nseveral parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of\nshapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure\nparts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several\ndeep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High\nSpeed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity\nlevel because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is\ngenerally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be\nsufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to\nan important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the\nCAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise\nchoice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for\nprismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely\nimplemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds\nof CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging\ndies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining\nareas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these\nareas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining\npreparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of\ncomplex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas\nextracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models\nof the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant\nduring machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he\ncarried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is\nbased on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which\nrepresent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical\nfeatures which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the\nidentification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper.\nDetailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging\ndies is presented in the last part of the paper.\n",

These simulators contain two\nindividual summations and are therefore easy to implement with lower\ncomplexity. Detailed statistical properties, including auto- and\ncross-correlations of the in-phase, quadrature components of the channels,\nenvelopes, and squared envelopes, are derived. The time-average statistical\nproperties and the corresponding variance are also investigated to justify that\nthe proposed simulators achieve good convergence performance.\n  Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed for various statistical\nproperties to validate the proposed simulators. Results show that the\nsimulators provide fast convergence to all desired statistical properties,\nincluding the probability density function (PDF), various auto- and\ncross-correlations, level crossing rate (LCR), and average fading duration\n(AFD).\n  While various tests and measurements in dense scattering urban and forest\nenvironments indicate that mobile-to-mobile channels may experience cascaded\nRayleigh fading, the proposed statistical models can be applied to simulate the\nunderlying channels.\n",

The D&M IS Success Model was used as a foundational\ntheory and then was refined to match the context of the current research.\nImportantly, in this study, system quality and information quality constructs\nwere defined on the basis of portals' characteristics since a mapping was\nconducted between the most significant functions and features of Web portals\nand quality constructs. The developed framework is deemed useful for theory and\npractice. From theoretical perspective, the dimensions that affect the\nperceived quality of Web portals are identified, and the measures that affect\neach quality dimension are also defined. On the practical level, contributions\ngained by this study can be observed in terms of the benefits decision makers,\nstrategists, operational employees and IT developers can gain. Assessing\nportals success in improving task innovation is important to help managers\n(i.e. decision makers) in making appropriate decisions concerning the adoption\nof portals' technology, by weighing its benefits against the costs needed to\nestablish and run such a technology. Moreover, assessing Web portals' success\ngives some insight to IT developers and designers concerning what aspects\nshould be taken when designing and establishing high quality portals, and what\nfunctions and features should be contained that would affect the perceived\nquality of portals and therefore users' intention to use portals.\n",

This decision tool is based on the value chain modelling, by\nconsidering the product requirements. In order to evaluate several performance\nindicators, a simulation of various potential value chains adapted to market\ndemand was conducted through a Value Chains Simulator (VCS). A discrete event\nsimulator is used to perform the simulation of these scenarios and to evaluate\nthe value as a global performance criterion (balancing cost, quality, delivery\ntime, services, etc.). An Analytical Hierarchy Process module supports the\nanalysis process. The value chain model is based on activities and uses the\nconcepts of resource consumption, while integrating the benefiting entities\nview point. A case study in the microelectronic field is carried out to\ncorroborate the validity of the proposed VCS.\n",

In this\nletter, the inherent square-law nonlinearity of the voltage-to-force transfer\nfunction of a cantilever resonator's capacitive transducer has been employed\nfor the realization of frequency doubling effect. Using this concept, frequency\ndoubling of input signals of 500 kHz to 1 MHz, and 227.5 kHz to 455 kHz has\nbeen experimentally demonstrated for two cantilever beams of length 51.75 and\n76.75 micrometer respectively.

The test results\nobtained are in reasonable compliance with the analytical and CoventorWare\nfinite-element simulation results.

This hybridization also suggests a definition for knowledge\nwithin Bayesian inference; a definition that has been curiously lacking. Given\nthat Darwinian processes are physical implementations of Bayesian inference and\nare utilized within numerous scientific theories across a wide range of\ndisciplines as mechanisms for the creation and evolution of knowledge we may\nview the conjunction of these theories, within universal Darwinism, as\ndescriptive of a world mind.

While the number of papers related to ERP implementation is\nsubstantial, ERP evaluation and selection approaches have received few\nattention. Motivated by the adaptation concept of the ERP systems, we propose\nin this paper a semi-structured approach for ERP system selection that differs\nfrom existing models in that it has a more holistic focus by simultaneously 1)\nconsidering the anticipated fitness of ERP solutions after the optimal\nresolution, within limited resources, of a set of the identified mismatches and\n2) evaluating candidate products according to both functional and\nnon-functional requirements. The approach consists of an iterative selection\nprocess model and an evaluation methodology based on 0-1 linear programming and\nMACBETH technique to elaborate multi-criteria performance expressions.\n",

Two recent\ntrends in microgrids are the integration of local renewable energy sources\n(such as wind farms) and the use of co-generation (i.e., to supply both\nelectricity and heat). However, these trends also bring unprecedented\nchallenges to the design of intelligent control strategies for microgrids.\nTraditional generation scheduling paradigms rely on perfect prediction of\nfuture electricity supply and demand. They are no longer applicable to\nmicrogrids with unpredictable renewable energy supply and with co-generation\n(that needs to consider both electricity and heat demand). In this paper, we\nstudy online algorithms for the microgrid generation scheduling problem with\nintermittent renewable energy sources and co-generation, with the goal of\nmaximizing the cost-savings with local generation. Based on the insights from\nthe structure of the offline optimal solution, we propose a class of\ncompetitive online algorithms, called CHASE (Competitive Heuristic Algorithm\nfor Scheduling Energy-generation), that track the offline optimal in an online\nfashion. Under typical settings, we show that CHASE achieves the best\ncompetitive ratio among all deterministic online algorithms, and the ratio is\nno larger than a small constant 3.\n",

Furthermore, manufacturers need to understand these emerging\nbusiness models as the capability of managing both asset and service provision\nto achieve use outcomes with customers, including emotional outcomes such as\ncustomer experience. Service-Dominant Logic proposes that all \"goods are a\ndistribution mechanism for service provision\", upon which we propose a\nvalue-centric approach to understanding the interactions between the asset and\nservice provision, and suggest a viable systems approach towards reorganising\nthe firm to achieve such a business model. Three case studies of B2B\nequipment-based service systems were analysed to understand customers'\nco-creation activities in achieving outcomes, in which we found that the\nco-creation of complex multi-dimensional value could be delivered through the\ndifferent value propositions of the firm catering to different aspects\n(dimensions) of the value to be co-created. The study provides a way for\nmanagers to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of firms in\nadopting emerging business models that design for value co-creation in what are\nultimately complex socio- technical systems.\n",

Target detection and tracking relies on\naccurate knowledge of the bistatic delay. Noise, measurement error, and the\nproblem of dense, overlapping multipath signals in the measured UWB channel\nimpulse response (CIR) all contribute to make bistatic delay estimation\nchallenging. It is often assumed that a calibration CIR, that is, a measurement\nfrom when no person is present, is easily subtracted from a newly captured CIR.\nWe show this is often not the case. We propose modeling the difference between\na current set of CIRs and a set of calibration CIRs as a hidden Markov model\n(HMM). Multiple experimental deployments are performed to collect CIR data and\ntest the performance of this model and compare its performance to existing\nmethods. Our experimental results show an RMSE of 2.85 ns and 2.76 ns for our\nHMM-based approach, compared to a thresholding method which, if the ideal\nthreshold is known a priori, achieves 3.28 ns and 4.58 ns. By using the\nBaum-Welch algorithm, the HMM-based estimator is shown to be very robust to\ninitial parameter settings. Localization performance is also improved using the\nHMM-based bistatic delay estimates.\n",

More importantly, by using the two cases,\nwe demonstrate that Guadalupe creates the great opportunity for many browser\nservices to get better resource utilization and energy proportionality by\nexploiting hardware heterogeneity.\n",

        "summary": "  The new era of information and communication technology (ICT) calls for a\ngreater understanding of the environmental impacts of recent technology. With\nincreasing energy cost and growing environmental concerns, green IT is\nreceiving more and more attention. Network and system design play a crucial\nrole in both computing and telecommunication systems. Significant part of this\nenergy cost goes to system update by downloading regularly patches and bug\nfixes to solve security problems and to assure that the operating system and\nother systems function properly. This paper describes a new design of Windows\nServer Update Services (WSUS), system responsible of downloads of the mentioned\npatches and updates from Microsoft Update website and then distributes them to\ncomputers on a network. The general idea behind our proposed design is simple.\nInstead of the periodical check done by the WSUS servers to ensure update form\nMicrosoft main servers, we rather propose to reverse the scenario in order to\nreduce energy consumption. In the proposed design, the Microsoft main server(s)\nsends signal to all WSUS servers to inform them about new updates. Once the\nsignal received, WSUS can contact the main server to start downloading.\n",

Electric load\nprofiles of tropical islands in developed countries are characterised by\nmorning, midday and evening peaks arising from all year round high power demand\nin the commercial and residential sectors, mostly due to air conditioning\nappliances and bad thermal conception of the building. In early 1995, a DSM\npilot initiative has been launched in the french islands of Guadeloupe and\nReunion through a partnership between the French Public Utility EDF,\ninstitutions involved in energy conservation, environment preservation (ADEME)\nand construction quality improvment, the University of Reunion Island and\nseveral other public and private partners (low cost housing institutions,\narchitects, energy consultant, etc...) to set up a standard in the thermal\nconception of buildings in tropical climates. This has led to definition of\noptimized bioclimatic urban planning and architectural design, the use of\npassive cooling architectural components, natural ventilation and energy\nefficient systems. The impact of each technical solution on the thermal comfort\nwithin the building was evaluated with an airflow and thermal building\nsimulation software (CODYRUN). These technical solutions have been edited in a\npedagogical reference document and have been implemented in 300 new pilot\ndwelling projects through the year 1996 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe\nisland. An experimental follow up is still in process in the first ECODOM\ndwellings for an experimental validation of the impact of the passive cooling\nsolutions on the comfort of the occupants and to modify them if necessary.\n",

We show that allowing\nthe search to 'backtrack' to a previously visited solution and resuming the\niterative variable neighborhood descent by 'pruning' the already explored\nneighborhood branches leads to the design of effective and efficient search\nheuristics. We describe this idea by discussing its basic design components\nwithin a generic algorithmic scheme and we propose some simple and intuitive\nstrategies to guide the search when traversing the neighborhood tree. We\nconduct a thorough experimental analysis of this approach by considering two\ndifferent problem domains, namely, the Total Weighted Tardiness Problem\n(SMTWTP), and the more sophisticated Location Routing Problem (LRP). We show\nthat independently of the considered domain, the approach is highly\ncompetitive. In particular, we show that using different branching and\nbacktracking strategies when exploring the neighborhood tree allows us to\nachieve different trade-offs in terms of solution quality and computing cost.\n",

In this paper, we propose a new\nlow power coding technique by decreasing the number of switching activities on\nthe buses which use transition signaling to transmit data. This approach\ndedicates the symbols with less ones to high probability data. MFLP unlike the\nmost low power encoding does not rely on spatial redundancy. Due to this\nsuperiority, MFLP is unique in power decreasing in the Network on Chip (NoC).\nNot only does this algorithm reduce the power consumption, but also it can\ncompress the data. It offers a tradeoff to designers to choose between\ncompression and power; that is, the more power consumption decrease we need,\nthe less compression we earn. This coding uses tree based infrastructure in\norder to decrease the number of ones to reduce the switching activities, and\nthe power consumption consequently. The proposed algorithm constructs the tree\nwith this contribution that code words with less ones are allocated to more\nfrequent data. The experimental results for the outside and inside of the NoC\nindicate that the proposed coding algorithm reduces the switching activity up\nto 30 and 45%, the link power consumption up to 35 and 46% and the total power\ndissipation up to 34.9 and 16% for the outside and inside of the NoC,\nrespectively.\n",

In particular, the less critical tasks are carelessly\ndiscarded when the computation demand of (some of) the high critical tasks\nincreases.

With the increasing\nimportance of mobile embedded systems and flexible applications, considerable\nprogress in research has been made for power management. Power constraints are\nincreasingly becoming the critical component of the design specifications of\nthese systems. It helps in pre-determining the suitable hardware architecture\nfor the target application. The aim of this paper is to present a technique to\nestimate 'pre-run time' and 'power' of a software mapped onto a hardware\nsystem; guaranteeing the compliance of temporal constraints while generating a\nschedule of tasks of software. Real time systems must handle several\nindependent macro-tasks, each represented by a task graph, which includes\ncommunications and precedence constraints. We propose a novel approach for\npower estimation of embedded software using the Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG)\nor task graph model. This methodology uses an existing Hierarchical Concurrent\nFlow Graph (HCFG) technique for the power analysis of the CDFGs. We have\nevaluated our technique for energy efficient scheduling over various task graph\nbenchmarks. The results obtained prove the utility and efficacy of our proposed\napproach for power analysis of embedded software. We also present a methodology\nto obtain an energy optimal voltage assignment and perform scheduling by taking\nadvantage of the relaxation in execution time of tasks.\n",

Accuracy degrades dramatically if sensors do not surround the\narea. However, law enforcement officers sometimes face situations where it is\nnot possible or practical to place sensors on all sides of the target room or\nbuilding. For example, for an armed subject barricaded in a motel room, police\nmay be able to place sensors in adjacent rooms, but not in front of the room,\nwhere the subject would see them. In this paper, we show that using two\nultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radios, in addition to multiple RSS sensors,\nimproves the localization accuracy, particularly on the axis where no sensors\nare placed (which we call the x-axis). We introduce three methods for combining\nthe RSS and UWB data. By using UWB radios together with RSS sensors, it is\nstill possible to localize a person through walls even when the devices are\nplaced only on two sides of the target area. Including the data from the UWB\nradios can reduce the localization area of uncertainty by more than 60%.\n",

The\nemerging scenario motivates us to revisit the classical operator scheduling\nproblem under the availability of DVFS enabled functional units that can\ntrade-off cycles with power. We study the design space defined due to this\ntrade-off and present a branch-and-bound(B/B) algorithm to explore this state\nspace and report the pareto-optimal front with respect to area and power. The\nscheduling also aims at maximum resource sharing and is able to attain\nsufficient area and power gains for complex benchmarks when timing constraints\nare relaxed by sufficient amount. Experimental results show that the algorithm\nthat operates without any user constraint(area/power) is able to solve the\nproblem for most available benchmarks, and the use of power budget or area\nbudget constraints leads to significant performance gain.\n",

So thus, the automatic gates are one of the\nexamples that human nature invent to bring comfort and ease in its daily life.\nTo this end, we model and design an automatic sliding door with a room light\ncontrol system to provide the mentioned needs. This was achieved by considering\nsome factors such as economy, availability of components and research\nmaterials, efficiency, compatibility and portability and also durability in the\ndesign process. The performance of the system after test met design\nspecifications. This system works on the principle of breaking an infrared beam\nof light, sensed by a photodiode. It consists of two transmitting infrared\ndiodes and two receiving photo-diodes. The first one is for someone coming in\nand the second one is for someone going out of the room. The photodiodes are\nconnected to comparators, which give a lower output when the beam is broken and\nhigh output when transmitting normally. The general operation of the work and\nperformance is dependent on the presence of an intruder entering through the\ndoor and how close he/she is in closer to the door. The door is meant to open\nautomatically but in a case where there is no power supply trying to force the\ndoor open would damage the mechanical control system of the unit.

However, most heart rate measuring tools\nand environments are expensive and do not follow ergonomics. Our proposed Heart\nRate Measuring (HRM) device is economical and user friendly and uses optical\ntechnology to detect the flow of blood through index finger. Three phases are\nused to detect pulses on the fingertip that include pulse detection, signal\nextraction, and pulse amplification. Qualitative and quantitative performance\nevaluation of the device on real signals shows accuracy in heart rate\nestimation, even under intense of physical activity. We compared the\nperformance of HRM device with Electrocardiogram reports and manual pulse\nmeasurement of heartbeat of 90 human subjects of different ages. The results\nshowed that the error rate of the device is negligible.\n",

In this paper, we use graphical methods to study defending\nmechanisms against false-data injection attacks on power system state\nestimation. By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data\ninjection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We\ncharacterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables\nwith minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a\ngraph. Based on the graphical characterization, we propose both exact and\nreduced-complexity approximation algorithms. In particular, we show that the\nproposed tree-pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces\ncomputational complexity, while yielding negligible performance degradation\ncompared with the optimal algorithms. The advantageous performance of the\nproposed defending mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system\ntestcases.\n",

The license describing these\nuse-conditions typically accompanies the content as its metadata. A resulting\nproblem is that the license and the content can get separated and lose track of\neach other. The best metadata have two distinct qualities--they are created\nautomatically without user intervention, and they are embedded within the data\nthat they describe. If licenses are also created and transported this way, data\nwill always have licenses, and the licenses will be readily examinable. When\ntwo or more datasets are combined, a new dataset, and with it a new license,\nare created. This new license is a function of the licenses of the component\ndatasets and any additional conditions that the person combining the datasets\nmight want to impose. Following the notion of a data-purpose algebra, we model\nthis phenomenon by interpreting the transfer and conjunction of data as\ninducing an algebraic operation on the corresponding licenses. When a dataset\npasses from one source to the next its license is transformed in a\ndeterministic way, and similarly when datasets are combined the associated\nlicenses are combined in a non-trivial algebraic manner. Modern,\ncomputer-savvy, licensing regimes such as Creative Commons allow writing the\nlicense in a special kind of language called Creative Commons Rights Expression\nLanguage (ccREL). ccREL allows creating and embedding the license using RDFa\nutilizing XHTML. This is preferred over DRM which includes the rights in a\nbinary file completely opaque to nearly all users. The colocation of metadata\nwith human-visible XHTML makes the license more transparent.

The paper shows that improved surveillance\ntechnologies can yield 4% to 6% reduction of aircraft on taxiway, and therefore\nemissions, in addition to the savings currently observed by implementing\nthreshold starategies under evaluation at Boston Logan Airport and other busy\nairports during congested periods. These calculated benefits contrast sharply\nwith our previous work, which relied on simplified airport ramp areas with a\nsingle departure spot, and where fewer environmental and economic benefits of\nadvanced surface surveillance systems could be established.

        "summary": "  Gate holding reduces congestion by reducing the number of aircraft present on\nthe airport surface at any time, while not starving the runway. Because some\ndeparting flights are held at gates, there is a possibility that arriving\nflights cannot access the gates and have to wait until the gates are cleared.\nThis is called a gate conflict. Robust gate assignment is an assignment that\nminimizes gate conflicts by assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time\ngap between two consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment\nrobust, but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to\nsimulate the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The\nmodel is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia\nAirport (LGA) and a U.S. hub airport. Then, the model simulates the airport\ndeparture process with the current gate assignment and a robust gate assignment\nto assess the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control. The\nresults show that the robust gate assignment reduces the number of gate\nconflicts caused by gate holding compared to the current gate assignment.\nTherefore, robust gate assignment can be combined with gate-holding departure\ncontrol to improve operations at congested airports with limited gate\nresources.\n",

We started\nby examining published articles related to marketing, Web 2.0, Customer\nRelationship Management Systems, CRM, and social media in a step to conduct an\nextensive review of the available literature. Then, we presented critique of\nthe articles we have examined. After that, we have been able to develop the\nmodel we are proposing in this research. As this paper shows, the proposed\nmodel will help in transforming marketing plans and strategies from its\ntraditional approach into, what we would like to call, marketing 2.0 approach\nsmoothly. There are some unavoidable limitations due to the given time and\nscope constrains. The factors included in the proposed model does not cover\nevery related aspect, however, they cover the most important ones.\n",

        "summary": "  Robustness is as important as efficiency in air transportation. All\ncomponents in the air traffic system are connected to form an interactive\nnetwork. So, a disturbance that occurs in one component, for example, a severe\ndelay at an airport, can influence the entire network. Delays are easily\npropagated between flights through gates, but the propagation can be reduced if\ngate assignments are robust against stochastic delays. In this paper, we\nanalyze gate delays and suggest an approach that involves assigning gates while\nmaking them robust against stochastic delays. We extract an example flight\nschedule from data source and generate schedules with increased traffic to\nanalyze how the compact flight schedules impact the robustness of gate\nassignment. Simulation results show that our approach improves the robustness\nof gate assignment. Particularly, the robust gate assignment reduces average\nduration of gate conflicts by 96.3% and the number of gate conflicts by 96.7%\ncompared to the baseline assignment. However, the robust gate assignment\nresults in longer transit time for passengers, and a trade-off between the\nrobustness of gate assignment and passenger transit time is presented.\n",

For this\ndata communication is performed between two modules using the concept of IPT.\nIPT was deemed to be the best solution to the system houses a multi parameter\nacquisition module such as temperature, speed, voltage, current and data\ntransfer from the motor. The receiver side is another microcontroller coupled\nto an inductive coil that gets the data and displays in the LCD. A brief\nbackground to IPT Inductive Power Transfer technology and its applications is\ngiven and the design criteria for the paper are defined in detail. To be\naccurate, IPT data communication helps to reduce unnecessary wire connections\nand data is transmitted without any touch. Further the paper can be enhanced by\nlooking for fault analysis inside the motor. This can be done by analyzing\nvarious parameters of the motor. A novel two-way IPT communication system was\ndesigned, which worked on the concept of pulsing the system on and off to send\ndata serially. The paper involves transmission of data through inductive flux\nwithout any contact between the two modules. Further as no frequency tunings or\nany calibration is required between different modules a single system can be\nused with multiple clients. This reduces a lot of hazards such as interference\nwith other modules and RF transmitters in the vicinity.\n",

Due to the spread of hazards, latency in\ninformation updating and unstable flows of civilians, emergency evacuation is\nabsolutely a complex transshipment problem involving numerous sources and\nmultiple destinations. Previous algorithms which commonly need either a full\ngraph search or a convergence process suffer from high computational and\ncommunication overheads. This research report surveys the current emergency\nnavigation algorithms and adapts the concept of Cognitive Packet Network (CPN)\nto the context of emergency evacuation. By using random neural networks, the\nCPN based algorithm can explore optimal routes rapidly and adaptively in a\nhighly dynamic emergency environment with low expense. Simultaneously, in\nemergency situations there are typically different categories of evacuees such\nas people of different age groups. However, current algorithms only consider\n\"normal\" evacuees and do not meet the specific requirements of diverse\nevacuees. Our algorithms make use of the flexibility of CPN which can operate\nwith different user-defined goals to customize appropriate paths for each\ncategory. The CPN algorithm is simulated in a graph based discrete-event\nsimulator and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is taken as reference. The\nresults show that the CPN algorithm reaches the performance of ideal\npath-finding algorithm and quality of service is improved by using specific\ngoal functions for diverse categories of evacuees.

Smart\nhomes define optimal consumption as either balancing/leveling consumption such\nthat the utility company is presented with a uniform demand or as minimizing\nconsumption costs by storing energy during off-peak time periods when prices\nare lower and use the stored energy during peak time periods when prices are\nhigher. Due to the varying nature of energy requirements of household and\nmarket energy prices over different time periods in a day, households face a\ntrade-off between consuming to meet their current energy requirements and/or\nstoring energy for future consumption and/or spending energy stored in the\npast. These trade-offs or consumption preferences of the household are modeled\nas utility functions using consumer theory. We introduce two different utility\nfunctions, one for cost minimization and another for consumption\nbalancing/leveling, that are maximized subject to respective budget,\nconsumption, storage and savings constraints to solve for the optimum\nconsumption profile. The optimization problem of a household with energy\nstorage is formulated as a geometric program for consumption\nbalancing/leveling, while cost minimization is formulated as a linear\nprogramming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves\nextremely low peak to average ratio in the consumption balancing/leveling\nscheme with about 8% reduction in consumption costs and the least possible\namount for electricity bill with about 12% reduction in consumption costs in\nthe cost minimization scheme.\n",

        "summary": "  A noise map facilitates the monitoring of environmental noise pollution in\nurban areas. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in\nurban areas are expensive and rarely updated, as they rely on population and\ntraffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing can be\nleveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to- date\nnoise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and\nperformance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system\ncalled Ear-Phone. Ear-Phone investigates the use of different interpolation and\nregularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the\nnoise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data\ncollection. Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One\nmobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise\npollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones\nas sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary\ndepending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the\nuser is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her palm). To address this\nproblem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to\naccurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery,\nEar-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-phone also\nimplements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be\ncarried out without any technical skills whatsoever required on the user's\npart. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone\nis a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system\nresource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction\naccuracy of the noise map.\n",

It is often assessed\nclinically, but the assessments occur infrequently and do not allow optimal\ndetection of key health changes when they occur. In this paper, we show that\nthe time gap between activations of a pair of Passive Infrared (PIR) motion\nsensors installed in the consecutively visited room pair carry rich latent\ninformation about a person's gait velocity. We name this time gap transition\ntime and show that despite a six second refractory period of the PIR sensors,\ntransition time can be used to obtain an accurate representation of gait\nvelocity.\n  Using a Support Vector Regression (SVR) approach to model the relationship\nbetween transition time and gait velocity, we show that gait velocity can be\nestimated with an average error less than 2.5 cm/sec. This is demonstrated with\ndata collected over a 5 year period from 74 older adults monitored in their own\nhomes.\n  This method is simple and cost effective and has advantages over competing\napproaches such as: obtaining 20 to 100x more gait velocity measurements per\nday and offering the fusion of location-specific information with time stamped\ngait estimates. These advantages allow stable estimates of gait parameters\n(maximum or average speed, variability) at shorter time scales than current\napproaches. This also provides a pervasive in-home method for context-aware\ngait velocity sensing that allows for monitoring of gait trajectories in space\nand time.\n",

The EE is evaluated by the total energy consumption for\ntransmitting per message bit. Three channel cases are considered, namely static\nchannel with channel state information available at transmitter (CSIT),\nfast-varying (FV) channel with channel distribution information available at\ntransmitter (CDIT), and FV channel with CSIT. A general circuit power model is\nconsidered. For all the three channel cases, the tradeoff between the EE and SE\nis studied. It is shown that the EE improves strictly as the SE increases from\n0 to the optimum SE, and then strictly degrades as the SE increases beyond the\noptimum SE. The impact of {\\kappa}, {\\rho} and other system parameters on the\noptimum EE and corresponding SE is investigated to obtain insight.Some of the\nimportant and interesting results for all the channel cases include: (1) when\n{\\kappa} increases the SE corresponding to the optimum EE should keep unchanged\nif {\\phi}(R) = R, but reduced if {\\phi}(R) is strictly convex of R; (2) when\nthe rate-independent circuit power {\\rho} increases, the SE corresponding to\nthe optimum EE has to be increased. A polynomial-complexity algorithm is\ndeveloped with the bisection method to find the optimum SE. The insight is\ncorroborated and the optimum EE for the three cases are compared by simulation\nresults.\n",

In particular, we target photovoltaic\npanels with small form factors, as those exploited by embedded communication\ndevices such as wireless sensor nodes or, concerning modern cellular system\ntechnology, by small-cells. Our models are especially useful for the\ntheoretical investigation and the simulation of energetically self-sufficient\ncommunication systems including these devices. The Markov models that we derive\nin this paper are obtained from extensive solar radiation databases, that are\nwidely available online. Basically, from hourly radiance patterns, we derive\nthe corresponding amount of energy (current and voltage) that is accumulated\nover time, and we finally use it to represent the scavenged energy in terms of\nits relevant statistics. Toward this end, two clustering approaches for the raw\nradiance data are described and the resulting Markov models are compared\nagainst the empirical distributions. Our results indicate that Markov models\nwith just two states provide a rough characterization of the real data traces.\nWhile these could be sufficiently accurate for certain applications, slightly\nincreasing the number of states to, e.g., eight, allows the representation of\nthe real energy inflow process with an excellent level of accuracy in terms of\nfirst and second order statistics.

This is in opposition to the impossibility of solving\nbounded SPF in real (physical) circuit models. On the other hand, for binary\ncircuit models with constant-delay channels, we prove that SPF cannot be solved\neven in unbounded time; again in opposition to physical circuit models.\nConsequently, indeed none of the binary value-domain models proposed so far\n(and that we are aware of) faithfully captures glitch propagation of real\ncircuits.

Most of the ECG\nanalysing systems use explicit time plane features for cardiac pattern\nclassification. Application of this proposed technique for classification\neliminates the need for extraction of various explicit time plane features and\nhence reduces the complexity of the system. The cross-correlation is the\nmeasure of similarity between two waveforms or two time series and the cross\nexamination reveals localized similarities in time and scale. Parameters\nextracted from Wavelet Cross Spectrum (WCS) and Wavelet Coherence (WCOH) is\nused for classification. A pathologically varying pattern in QT zone of\ninferior lead III shows the presence of Inferior Myocardial Infarction (IMI).\nThe Cross Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Coherence is used for the cross\nexamination of single normal and abnormal (IMI) beats. A normal template beat\nis selected as the absolute normal pattern. Computation of the WCS and WCOH of\nthe selected normal template and various other normal and abnormal beats\nreveals the existence of variation among patterns under study. The Wavelet\ncross spectrum and Wavelet coherence of various ECG patterns shows\ndistinguishing characteristics over two specific regions R1 and R2, where R1 is\nthe QRS complex location and R2 is the T wave region. Parameters are identified\nfor classification of Type 1 IMI (non Q type, with ST elevation and attenuated\nQRS complex) and Type 2 IMI (Q type MI with deep Q and inverted T) and normal\nsubjects. Accuracy of the proposed classification method is obtained as 99.43%\nfor normal and abnormal class and 88.5% and 87.02% for Type I and Type II\nrespectively.\n",

In this\ncontext, distributed generators (DGs) are exploited to achieve other objectives\nbeyond supporting loads, such as the minimization of the power losses along the\ndistribution lines. The aim of this work is that of designing a full-fledged\nsystem that extends existing state of the art algorithms for the distributed\nminimization of power losses. We take into account practical aspects such as\nthe design of a communication and coordination protocol that is resilient to\nlink failures and manages channel access, message delivery and DG coordination.\nThus, we analyze the performance of the resulting optimization and\ncommunication scheme in terms of power loss reduction, reduction of aggregate\npower demand, convergence rate and resilience to communication link failures.\nAfter that, we discuss the results of a thorough simulation campaign, obtained\nusing topologies generated through a statistical approach that has been\nvalidated in previous research, by also assessing the performance deviation\nwith respect to localized schemes, where the DGs are operated independently.\nOur results reveal that the convergence and stability performance of the\nselected algorithms vary greatly. However, configurations exist for which\nconvergence is possible within five to ten communication steps and, when just\n30% of the nodes are DGs, the aggregate power demand is roughly halved. Also,\nsome of the considered approaches are quite robust against link failures as\nthey still provide gains with respect to the localized solutions for failure\nrates as high as 50%.\n",

APNs are similar to\nStochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) in as much as they both rely on component-based\nrepresentation of system state space, in contrast to Markov chains that\nexplicitly model the states of an entire system. In both frameworks, so-called\ntokens (denoted as small circles) represent individual entities comprising the\nsystem; however, SPN graphs contain two distinct types of nodes (called places\nand transitions) with transitions serving the purpose of routing tokens among\nplaces. As a result, a pair of place nodes in SPNs can be linked to each other\nonly via a transient stop, a transition node. In contrast, APN graphs link\nplace nodes directly by arcs (transitions), similar to state space diagrams for\nMarkov chains, and separate transition nodes are not needed.\n  Tokens in APN are distinct and have labels that can assume both discrete\nvalues (\"colors\") and continuous values (\"ages\"), both of which can change\nduring simulation. Component interactions are modeled in APNs using triggers,\nwhich are either inhibitors or enablers (the inhibitors' opposites).\nHierarchical construction of APNs rely on using stacks (layers) of submodels\nwith automatically matching color policies. As a result, APNs provide at least\nthe same modeling power as SPNs, but, as demonstrated by means of several\nexamples, the resulting models are often more compact and transparent,\ntherefore facilitating more efficient performance evaluation of complex\nsystems.\n",

Compared with the free\nspace wireless communication channel, the underwater acoustic channel suffers\nfrom more severe multipath effect, the less available bandwidth and the even\ncomplex noise. The underwater acoustic channel is one of the most complicated\nwireless communication channels. To achieve a reliable underwater acoustic\ncommunication, Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation and Passive Time Reversal\nMirror (PTRM) equalization are considered to be a suitable scheme. However, due\nto the serious distortion of the received signal caused by the channel, this\nscheme suffers from a high Bit Error Rate (BER) under the condition of the low\nSignal to Noise Ratio (SNR). To solve this problem, we proposes a Carrier\nWaveform Inter-Displacement (CWID) modulation method based on the Linear\nFrequency Modulation (LFM) PSK and PTRM scheme. The new communication scheme\nreduces BER by increasing the difference from the carrier waveform for\ndifferent symbols. Simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of\nthe proposed method.\n",

Its basic\nprinciple is to detect the changes in the statistics of some radio quality\nmeasurements in order to infer the presence of people and objects in the radio\npath. However, the localisation accuracy of RTI suffers from complicated radio\npropagation behaviours such as multipath fading and shadowing. In order to\nimprove RTI localisation accuracy, we propose to use inexpensive and energy\nefficient electronically switched directional (ESD) antennas to improve the\nquality of radio link behaviour observations, and therefore, the localisation\naccuracy of RTI. We implement a directional RTI (dRTI) system to understand how\ndirectional antennas can be used to improve RTI localisation accuracy. We also\nstudy the impact of the choice of antenna directions on the localisation\naccuracy of dRTI and propose methods to effectively choose informative antenna\ndirections to improve localisation accuracy while reducing overhead. We\nevaluate the performance of dRTI in diverse indoor environments and show that\ndRTI significantly outperforms the existing RTI localisation methods based on\nomni-directional antennas.\n",

However, not all\nthe information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important and\nthus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises.\nThe Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) (Van de Weghe, 2004) is a promising\ndevelopment towards this goal. Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in\nthe past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction\ndomains. However, an inherent limitation of those QTC variations that deal with\nlateral movements is that they are limited to two-dimensional motion;\ntherefore, complex three-dimensional interactions, such as those occurring\nbetween flying planes or birds, cannot be captured. Towards that purpose, in\nthis paper QTC3Dis presented: a novel qualitative trajectory calculus that can\ndeal with full three-dimensional interactions. QTC3D is based on\ntransformations of the Frenet-Serret frames accompanying the trajectories of\nthe moving objects. Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition\nand properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an\napplication of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight. Thus, the power of QTC is\nnow extended to the full dimensionality of physical space, enabling succinct\nyet rich representations of spatial interactions between agents.\n",

In this paper, the aforementioned process is augmented\nwith an additional state. It is shown that the changes in received signal\nstrength are dictated by: i) electronic noise, when a person is not present in\nthe monitored area; ii) reflection, when a person is moving in the close\nvicinity of the line-of-sight; iii) shadowing, when a person is obstructing the\nline-of-sight component of the transmitter-receiver pair.

In addition to this if\naccident occurs in any remote area then using bump sensor accident is detected\nand SMS is send immediately using GSM. A situation that provides a good example\nof how the system works is when a driver is about to change lanes, and there is\na car in his blind spot. The sensors will detect that car and inform the driver\nbefore he starts turning, preventing him from potentially getting into a\nserious accident.\n",

Yet, few of them pay attention to\ndefining urban areas with micro data in a fine-scaled manner with large extend\nscale by incorporating the morphological and functional characteristics. This\npaper investigates an automated framework to delineate urban areas in the\nparcel level, using increasingly available ordnance surveys for generating all\nparcels (or geo-units) and ubiquitous points of interest (POIs) for inferring\ndensity of each parcel. A vector cellular automata model was adopted for\nidentifying urban parcels from all generated parcels, taking into account\ndensity, neighborhood condition, and other spatial variables of each parcel. We\napplied this approach for mapping urban areas of all 654 Chinese cities and\ncompared them with those interpreted from mid-resolution remote sensing images\nand inferred by population density and road intersections. Our proposed\nframework is proved to be more straight-forward, time-saving and fine-scaled,\ncompared with other existing ones, and reclaim the need for consistency,\nefficiency and availability in defining urban areas with well-consideration of\nomnipresent spatial and functional factors across cities.\n",

From the estimated moments, the\nprobability of failure and parametric yield can be estimated at each circuit\nconfiguration and corner, and these metrics are used for design optimization\nand making product qualification decisions. The problem is especially difficult\nif only a very small sample size is allowed for measurement or simulation, as\nis the case for complex analog/mixed-signal circuits.

Mathematically, we employ the hierarchical\nBayesian framework to exploit the underlying correlation in the data.

A case study is\npresented, where an application executes code then sleeps for a period of time.\nFor this example we show that our optimization could allow the application to\nrun on battery for up to 32% longer. We also show that for this scenario the\ntotal application energy can be reduced, even if the optimization increases the\nexecution time of the code.\n",

Unfortunately, it was\nrecently proved [F\\\"ugger et al., ASYNC'13] that no existing binary-valued\ncircuit model proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and\ninertial delay channels, faithfully captures glitch propagation: For the simple\nShort-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability\nto suppress a single glitch, we showed that the quite broad class of bounded\nsingle-history channels either contradict the unsolvability of SPF in bounded\ntime or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in physical circuits.\n  In this paper, we propose a class of binary circuit models that do not suffer\nfrom this deficiency: Like bounded single-history channels, our involution\nchannels involve delays that may depend on the time of the previous output\ntransition. Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based\non involutions, i.e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example\nof such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order\nanalog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We\nprove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history\nchannels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a\nlower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide\nan unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit\nmodels based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is\npossible in physical circuits. To the best of our knowledge, our model is hence\nthe very first candidate for a model that indeed guarantees faithful glitch\npropagation.\n",

In this\nthesis, we have explored the high performance NoC design for MPSoC and CMP\nstructures from the performance modeling in the offline design phase to the\nrouting algorithm and NoC architecture optimization. More specifically, we\nfirst deal with the issue of how to estimate an NoC design fast and accurately\nin the synthesis inner loop. For this purpose, we propose a machine learning\nbased latency regression model to evaluate the NoC designs with respect to\ndifferent configurations. Then, for high performance NoC designs, we tackle one\nof the most important problems, i.e., the routing algorithms design. For\navoiding temperature hotspots, a thermal-aware routing algorithm is proposed to\nachieve an even temperature profile for application-specific Network-on-chips\n(NoCs). For improving the reliability, a routing algorithm to achieve maximum\nperformance under fault is proposed. Finally, in the architecture level, we\npropose two new NoC structures using bi-directional links for the performance\noptimization. In particular, we propose a flit-level speedup scheme to enhance\nthe network-on-chip(NoC) performance utilizing bidirectional channels.

Big models are fine-scale regional/urban simulation\nmodels for a large geographical area, and they overcome the trade-off between\nsimulated scale and spatial unit by tackling both of them at the same time\nenabled by emerging big/open data, increasing computation power and matured\nregional/urban modeling methods. The concept, characteristics, and potential\napplications of big models have been elaborated. We addresse several case\nstudies to illustrate the progress of research and utilization on big models,\nincluding mapping urban areas for all Chinese cities, performing parcel-level\nurban simulation, and several ongoing research projects. Most of these\napplications can be adopted across the country, and all of them are focusing on\na fine-scale level, such as a parcel, a block, or a township (sub-district),\nwhich is not the same with the existing studies using conventional models that\nare only suitable for a certain single or two cities or regions, or for a\nlarger area but have to significantly sacrifice the data resolution. It is\nexpected that big models will mark a promising new era for the urban and\nregional study in the age of big data.\n",

Conventional LELELE type TPL technology\nsuffers from native conflict and overlapping problems. Recently, as an\nalternative process, triple patterning lithography with end cutting (LELE-EC)\nwas proposed to overcome the limitations of LELELE manufacturing. In LELE-EC\nprocess the first two masks are LELE type double patterning, while the third\nmask is used to generate the end-cuts. Although the layout decomposition\nproblem for LELELE has been well-studied in the literature, only few attempts\nhave been made to address the LELE-EC layout decomposition problem. In this\npaper we propose the comprehensive study for LELE-EC layout decomposition.\nConflict graph and end-cut graph are constructed to extract all the geometrical\nrelationships of both input layout and end-cut candidates. Based on these\ngraphs, integer linear programming (ILP) is formulated to minimize the conflict\nnumber and the stitch number. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n",

Furthermore, for embedded systems, low power\nconsumption should be generally considered together with high computing\nperformance. FPGAs, as programmable logic devices able to support different\ntypes of fine-grained parallelisms, their power and performance advantages were\nrecognized widely. However, designing applications on FPGA-based systems is\ntraditionally far from a task can be carried out by software programmers.\nGenerally, hardware engineers and even system-level software engineers have\nmore hardware/architectural knowledge but fewer algorithm and application\nknowledge.

One of the major challenges associated with wireless\nsensor networks is the quality of the data and more specifically the detection\nof segment outliers and unusual events. Most previous research has focused on\ndetecting outliers that are errors that are caused by unreliable sensors and\nsensor nodes. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools\ncapable of identifying, tagging and visualizing erroneous segment outliers and\nunusual events from sensor data streams. In this paper, we present a SOUE\nDetector (Segment Outlier and Unusual Event-Detector) system for wireless\nsensor networks that combines statistical analyses using Dynamic Time Warping\n(DTW) with domain expert knowledge (captured via an ontology and semantic\ninferencing rules). The resulting Web portal enables scientist to efficiently\nsearch across a collection of wireless sensor data streams and identify,\nretrieve and display segment outliers (both erroneous and genuine) within the\ndata streams. In this paper, we firstly describe the detection algorithms, the\nimplementation details and the functionality of the SOUE Detector system.\nSecondly we evaluate our approach using data that comprises sensor observations\ncollected from a sensor network deployed in the Springbrook National Park in\nQueensland, Australia.

The most commonly deployed infrastructures to cater to this\nhave mostly been surveillance systems which only extract some data pertaining\nto the targets of interest in the area of observation and convey the\ninformation to the human operators. Accordingly, with the ever increasing rate\nat which warfare tactics are evolving, there has been a growing need for\nsmarter solutions to this problem of hostile intent enumeration. Recently, a\nnumber of developments have been made to ameliorate the efficacy and the\ncertitude with which this task is performed.

Hence, casualties caused by the poor decisions\nand guidance are only apparent at the end of the evacuation process and cannot\nthen be remedied. Previous research shows that the performance of routing\nalgorithms for evacuation purposes are sensitive to the initial distribution of\nevacuees, the occupancy levels, the type of disaster and its as well its\nlocations. Thus an algorithm that performs well in one scenario may achieve bad\nresults in another scenario. This problem is especially serious in\nheuristic-based routing algorithms for evacuees where results are affected by\nthe choice of certain parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nsimulation-based evacuee routing algorithm that optimises evacuation by making\nuse of the high computational power of cloud servers. Rather than guiding\nevacuees with a predetermined routing algorithm, a robust Cognitive Packet\nNetwork based algorithm is first evaluated via a cloud-based simulator in a\nfaster-than-real-time manner, and any \"simulated casualties\" are then re-routed\nusing a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain new safe paths for them to\nexits. This approach can be iterated as long as corrective action is still\npossible.\n",

These messages contain position, speed,\nheading, and other vital information that makes the vehicles aware of their\nsurroundings. The drawback of exchanging periodic cooperative messages is that\nthey generate significant channel load. Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC)\nalgorithms have been proposed to minimize the channel load. However, while the\nrationale for periodic message exchange is to improve awareness, existing DCC\nalgorithms do not use awareness as a metric for deciding when, at what power,\nand at what rate the periodic messages need to be sent in order to make sure\nall vehicles are informed. We propose an environment- and context-aware DCC\nalgorithm combines power and rate control in order to improve cooperative\nawareness by adapting to both specific propagation environments (e.g., urban\nintersections, open highways, suburban roads) as well as application\nrequirements (e.g., different target cooperative awareness range). Studying\nvarious operational conditions (e.g., speed, direction, and application\nrequirement), ECPR adjusts the transmit power of the messages in order to reach\nthe desired awareness ratio at the target distance while at the same time\ncontrolling the channel load using an adaptive rate control algorithm. By\nperforming extensive simulations, including realistic propagation as well as\nenvironment modeling and realistic vehicle operational environments (varying\ndemand on both awareness range and rate), we show that ECPR can increase\nawareness by 20% while keeping the channel load and interference at almost the\nsame level. When permitted by the awareness requirements, ECPR can improve the\naverage message rate by 18% compared to algorithms that perform rate adaptation\nonly.\n",

Recently the traditional EBL\nsystem is extended into multi-column cell (MCC) system to further improve the\nthroughput.

Because of the area constraint of stencil, MCC system\nneeds to be packed/planned carefully to take advantage of the characters.

To solve OSP problem in MCC system, we present a tool, E-BLOW, with\nseveral novel speedup techniques, such as successive relaxation, dynamic\nprogramming, and KD-Tree based clustering.

These chronic problems\noften fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe\nimpacts (e.g. system failure). Therefore it's a challenging issue how to timely\ndetect these problems to prevent system crash. Although a large quantity of\napproaches have been proposed to solve this issue, the accuracy and\neffectiveness of these approaches are still far from satisfactory due to the\ninsufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. In this paper, we present a\nnovel entropy-based aging indicator, Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy\n(MMSE). MMSE employs the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to\nindicate software aging and leverages multi-scale and multi-dimension\nintegration to tolerate system fluctuations. Via theoretical proof and\nexperimental evaluation, we demonstrate that MMSE satisfies Stability,\nMonotonicity and Integration which we conjecture that an ideal aging indicator\nshould have. Based upon MMSE, we develop three failure detection approaches\nencapsulated in a proof-of-concept named CHAOS. The experimental evaluations in\na Video on Demand (VoD) system and in a real-world production system,\nAntVision, show that CHAOS can detect the failure-prone state in an\nextraordinarily high accuracy and a near 0 Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF).\nCompared to previous approaches, CHAOS improves the detection accuracy by about\n5 times and reduces the ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude. In addition, CHAOS\nis light-weight enough to satisfy the realtime requirement.\n",

The development of onboard navigation system provides\ndrivers some traveling route information. The main novelty of our approach is\nto envision sharing partial traveling information to the encountered vehicles\nfor better service. Our data forwarding algorithm utilizes this lightweight\ninformation under the delusive paths privacy preservation together with the\nsocial community structure in vehicular networks. We assume that data\ntransmission is carried by vehicles and road side units (RSUs), while cellular\nnetwork manages and coordinates relevant global information. The approximate\ndestination set is the set of RSUs that are often passed by the destination\nvehicle. RSU importance is raised by summing encounter ratios of RSUs in the\nsame connected component. We first define a concept of space-time\napproachability which is derived from shared partial traveling route and\nencounter information. It describes the capability of a vehicle to advance\nmessages toward destination. Then, we design a novel data forwarding algorithm,\ncalled approachability based algorithm, which combines the space-time\napproachability with the social community attribute in vehicular networks. We\nevaluate our approachability based algorithm on data sets from San Francisco\nCabspotting and Shanghai Taxi Movement. Results show that the partially shared\ntraveling information plays a positive role in data forwarding in vehicular\nnetworks.

Prior work on this problem relies\nprimarily on applying Expectation-Maximization (EM) on the underlying maximum\nlikelihood problem to estimate true answers as well as worker quality.\nUnfortunately, EM only provides a locally optimal solution rather than a\nglobally optimal one. Other solutions to the problem (that do not leverage EM)\nfail to provide global optimality guarantees as well. In this paper, we focus\non filtering, where tasks require the evaluation of a yes/no predicate, and\nrating, where tasks elicit integer scores from a finite domain. We design\nalgorithms for finding the global optimal estimates of correct task answers and\nworker quality for the underlying maximum likelihood problem, and characterize\nthe complexity of these algorithms. Our algorithms conceptually consider all\nmappings from tasks to true answers (typically a very large number), leveraging\ntwo key ideas to reduce, by several orders of magnitude, the number of mappings\nunder consideration, while preserving optimality. We also demonstrate that\nthese algorithms often find more accurate estimates than EM-based algorithms.\nThis paper makes an important contribution towards understanding the inherent\ncomplexity of globally optimal crowdsourcing quality management.\n",

Yet as an area of\nstudy, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a\nconsensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research\ndesigns that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper\naims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\nlinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\noperationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by\ncombining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of\n'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional\nissues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five\nattributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)\nradical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent\nimpact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising\nemerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed\nattributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly\nin, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and\nstudy of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,\ncitation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)\nand elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different\nattributes of emergence.\n",

Input to the\nfuzzy step is the total load per phase of the feeders. Output of the fuzzy step\nis the load change values, negative value for load releasing and positive value\nfor load receiving. The output of the fuzzy step is the input to the load\nchanging system. The load changing system uses combinatorial optimization\ntechniques to translate the change values (kW) into number of load points and\nthen selects the specific load points. It also performs the inter-changing of\nthe load points between the releasing and the receiving phases in an optimal\nfashion.

The proposed technique enables voltage\ntuning based on the observed frequency of the ROs, taken as a representation of\nthe device speed and used to estimate a safe minimum operating voltage at a\ngiven core frequency. A conservative linear relationship between RO frequency\nand silicon speed is used to approximate the critical path of the processor.\n  Using a multi-purpose RO not specifically implemented for critical path\ncharacterisation is a unique approach to voltage tuning. The parameters\ngoverning the relationship between RO and silicon speed are obtained through\nthe testing of a sample of processors from different wafer regions. These\nparameters can then be used on all devices of that model. The tuning method and\nsoftware control framework is demonstrated on a sample of XMOS XS1-U8A-64\nembedded microprocessors, yielding a dynamic power saving of up to 25% with no\nperformance reduction and no negative impact on the real-time constraints of\nthe embedded software running on the processor.\n",

However, vehicular crowdsensing data is always\ncoarse-grained. This coarseness can lead to the incompleteness of travel\nspeeds. Aiming to handle this problem as well as estimate travel speed\naccurately, in this paper, we propose an approach named STC that exploits the\nspatial-temporal correlation among travel speeds for roads by introducing the\ntime-lagged cross correlation function. The time lagging factor describes the\ntime consumption of traffic feature diffusion along roads. To properly\ncalculate cross correlation, we novelly make the determination of the time\nlagging factor self-adaptive by recording the locations of vehicles at\ndifferent roads. Then, utilizing the local stationarity of cross correlation,\nwe further reduce the problem of single-road travel speed vacancy completion to\na minimization problem. Finally, we fill all the vacancies of travel speed for\nroads in a recursive way using the geometric structure of road net. Elaborate\nexperiments based on real taxi trace data show that STC can settle the\nincompleteness problem of vehicle crowdsensing data based travel speed\nestimation and ensure the accuracy of estimated travel speed better, in\ncomparison with representative existing methods such as KNN, Kriging and ARIMA.\n",

Our experiments show\nthat the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a\nperson's chest is affected by the breathing process. This effect extends to\nscenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the\naccess point and the device, even without holding it.

The system handles various challenges such as noise\nelimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting\nabnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using\noff-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it\ncan estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute\n(bpm) error.

These steps increase\nthe time resolution of diffraction techniques. Results on synthetic and real\ncases show the robustness of the proposed method.\n",

The resulting \"vertical\ndimension\" further specializes the systemic classes and makes it easier to\nassess similarities and differences regarding properties such as resilience,\nperformance, and quality-of-experience. Our approach is exemplified by\nconsidering a telemonitoring system designed in the framework of Flemish\nproject \"Little Sister\".

A first question thus arose as to the\nintegration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new\nmodel calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new\ndaylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes\nand experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent\nagreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a\ntropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output\nwith detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion\nIsland (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the\ninterest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings.\nIntroduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow\nsimulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2],\nand TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be\nintegrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the\nlatter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After\nmore than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to\nadd a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some\ndetails on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial\nsoftware and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical\nEngineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion\nIsland, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation\nand moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone\napproach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing\nthermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code\nwere successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model,\nthe majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy\nAgency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated\ntechnologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\ndeveloped BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building\nsimulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of\ntest cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of\nbuilding energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach\nis very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input\nequivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by\nmost of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of\nprograms considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe.\nAssociated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of\nvalidation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].\n",

However, STT-MRAMs suffer from poor reliability due\nto shared read and write paths. Additionally, conflicting requirements for data\nretention and write-ability (both related to the energy barrier height of the\nmagnet) makes design more challenging. Furthermore, the energy barrier height\ndepends on the physical dimensions of the free layer. Any variations in the\ndimensions of the free layer lead to variations in the energy barrier height.\nIn order to address poor reliability of STT-MRAMs, usage of Error Correcting\nCodes (ECC) have been proposed. Unlike traditional CMOS memory technologies,\nECC is expected to correct both soft and hard errors in STT_MRAMs. To achieve\nacceptable yield with low write power, stronger ECC is required, resulting in\nincreased number of encoded bits and degraded memory efficiency. In this paper,\nwe propose Failure aware ECC (FaECC), which masks permanent faults while\nmaintaining the same correction capability for soft errors without increased\nencoded bits. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of process variations on\nrun-time reliability of STT-MRAMs. We provide an analysis on the impact of\nprocess variations on the life-time of the free layer and retention failures.\nIn order to analyze the effectiveness of our methodology, we developed a\ncross-layer simulation framework that consists of device, circuit and array\nlevel analysis of STT-MRAM memory arrays.

It is appropriate for\nascertaining distributional equivalence of a model replication with its\noriginal implementation. Besides model-independence, this technique has three\nother desirable properties: a) it automatically selects output features that\nbest explain implementation differences; b) it does not depend on the\ndistributional properties of simulation output; and, c) it simplifies the\nmodelers' work, as it can be used directly on simulation outputs.

The first step of this process is coverage prediction, which can be\nperformed by interpolating geo-located measurements reported to the network by\nmobile users' equipments. In previous works, we proposed a low complexity\ncoverage prediction algorithm based on the adaptation of the Geo-statistics\nFixed Rank Kriging (FRK) algorithm. We supposed that the geo-location\ninformation reported with the radio measurements was perfect, which is not the\ncase in reality. In this paper, we study the impact of location uncertainty on\nthe coverage prediction accuracy and we extend the previously proposed\nalgorithm to include geo-location error in the prediction model. We validate\nthe proposed algorithm using both simulated and real field measurements. The\nFRK extended to take into account the location uncertainty proves to enhance\nthe prediction accuracy while keeping a reasonable computational complexity.\n",

The goal of an energy\nmodel for source code is to lay a foundation for the application of\nenergy-saving techniques during software development. The challenge is to\nrelate hardware energy consumption to high-level application code, considering\nthe complex run-time context and software stack. Traditional techniques build\nthe energy model by mapping a hardware energy model onto software constructs;\nthis approach faces obstacles when the software stack consists of a number of\nabstract layers. Another approach that has been followed is to utilize hardware\nor operating system features to estimate software energy information at a\ncoarse level of granularity such as blocks, methods or even applications. In\nthis paper, we explain how to construct a fine-grained energy model for the\nsource code, which is based on \"energy operations\" identified directly from the\nsource code and able to provide more valuable information for code\noptimization. We apply the approach to a class of applications based on a\ngame-engine, and explain the wider applicability of the method.\n",

ITS contributes to\nsustainable development by using technology to make the transportation system\nmore efficient; improving our environment by reducing emissions, reducing the\nneed for new construction and improving our daily lives through reduced\ncongestion. A key component of ITS is traveler information. The Oregon\nDepartment of Transportation (ODOT) recently implemented a new traveler\ninformation system on selected freeways to provide drivers with travel time\nestimates that allow them to make more informed decisions about routing to\ntheir destinations. The ODOT project aims to improve traffic flow and promote\nefficient traffic movement, which can reduce emissions rates and improve air\nquality. The new ODOT system is based on travel data collected from a\nrecently-increased set of sensors installed on its freeways. Our current\nproject investigates novel data cleaning methodologies and the integration of\nthose methodologies into the prediction of travel times. We use machine\nlearning techniques on our archive to identify suspect data, and calculate\nrevised travel times excluding this suspect data.

Hence, implementing efficient encoding schemes are essential to\nreduce power consumption in such applications. In this paper, we propose an\nanalytical distortion model for the EEG-based encoding systems. Using this\nmodel, the encoder can effectively reconfigure its complexity by adjusting its\ncontrol parameters to satisfy application constraints while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy at the receiver side. The simulation results illustrate\nthat the main parameters that affect the distortion are compression ratio and\nfilter length of the considered DWT-based encoder. Furthermore, it is found\nthat the wireless channel variations have a significant influence on the\nestimated distortion at the receiver side.\n",

This study explores the ability of head pose to\nserve as an estimator for driver gaze by connecting head rotation data with\nmanually coded gaze region data using both a statistical analysis approach and\na predictive (i.e., machine learning) approach. For the latter, classification\naccuracy increased as visual angles between two glance locations increased. In\nother words, the greater the shift in gaze, the higher the accuracy of\nclassification. This is an intuitive but important concept that we make\nexplicit through our analysis. The highest accuracy achieved was 83% using the\nmethod of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for the binary gaze classification problem\nof (1) the forward roadway versus (2) the center stack. Results suggest that\nalthough there are individual differences in head-glance correspondence while\ndriving, classifier models based on head-rotation data may be robust to these\ndifferences and therefore can serve as reasonable estimators for glance\nlocation. The results suggest that driver head pose can be used as a surrogate\nfor eye gaze in several key conditions including the identification of\nhigh-eccentricity glances.

Within this framework, we show that decidability imposes\nabsolute limits to the stable growth of complexity in computable dynamical\nsystems. Conversely, systems that exhibit (strong) open-ended evolution must be\nundecidable, establishing undecidability as a requirement for such systems.\nComplexity is assessed in terms of three measures: sophistication, coarse\nsophistication and busy beaver logical depth. These three complexity measures\nassign low complexity values to random (incompressible) objects. As time grows,\nthe stated complexity measures allow for the existence of complex states during\nthe evolution of a computable dynamical system. We show, however, that finding\nthese states involves undecidable computations. We conjecture that for similar\ncomplexity measures that assign low complexity values, decidability imposes\ncomparable limits to the stable growth of complexity, and that such behaviour\nis necessary for non-trivial evolutionary systems. We show that the\nundecidability of adapted states imposes novel and unpredictable behaviour on\nthe individuals or populations being modelled. Such behaviour is irreducible.\nFinally, we offer an example of a system, first proposed by Chaitin, that\nexhibits strong OEE.\n",

Visual Display Units, capable of displaying video data at High\nDefinition and Ultra HD display resolutions, are frequently utilized on a\nglobal scale. Video compression artifacts that are present due to high levels\nof quantization, which are typically inconspicuous in low display resolution\nenvironments, are clearly visible on HD and UHD video data and VDUs. The\ndefault QM technique in HEVC does not take into account the video data\nresolution, nor does it take into consideration the associated display\nresolution of a VDU to determine the appropriate levels of quantization\nrequired to reduce unwanted video compression artifacts. Based on this fact, we\npropose a novel, adaptive quantization matrix technique for the HEVC standard,\nincluding Scalable HEVC. Our technique, which is based on a refinement of the\ncurrent HVS-CSF QM approach in HEVC, takes into consideration the display\nresolution of the target VDU for the purpose of minimizing video compression\nartifacts. In SHVC SHM 9.0, and compared with anchors, the proposed technique\nyields important quality and coding improvements for the Random Access\nconfiguration, with a maximum of 56.5% luma BD-Rate reductions in the\nenhancement layer.

Presenting an overview of all the quantitative and qualitative\napproaches concerned with modelling and evaluating the prediction of\nreliability is so important for future reliability studies and for academic\nresearch to come up with new methods and tools. The mechatronic system is a\nhybrid system, it is dynamic, reconfigurable, and interactive.

However, an exploratory data analysis with the resources of the R\nstatistical data analysis language found that damage reports are missing in\nmore than half of the records, that part of the damage values are incorrect,\nand that, despite all efforts of standardizations, non-standard event type\nnames are still finding their way into the database.

To avoid the aforementioned problems, we\npropose Accelerated Evaluation, focusing on the car-following scenario. The\nstochastic human-controlled vehicle (HV) motions are modeled based on 1.3\nmillion miles of naturalistic driving data collected by the University of\nMichigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. The statistics of the HV\nbehaviors are then modified to generate more intense interactions between HVs\nand AVs to accelerate the evaluation procedure. The Importance Sampling theory\nwas used to ensure that the safety benefits of AVs are accurately assessed\nunder accelerated tests. Crash, injury and conflict rates for a simulated AV\nare simulated to demonstrate the proposed approach. Results show that test\nduration is reduced by a factor of 300 to 100,000 compared with the\nnon-accelerated (naturalistic) evaluation.

As such organisms\nbecome more common it is desirable to be able to distinguish between natural\nand artificial life forms. In this paper, we present this challenge as a\ngeneralized version of Darwin's original problem, which he so brilliantly\naddressed in On the Origin of Species. After formalizing the problem of\ndetermining origin of samples we demonstrate that the problem is in fact\nunsolvable, in the general case, if computational resources of considered\noriginator algorithms have not been limited and priors for such algorithms are\nknown to be equal. Our results should be of interest to astrobiologists and\nscientists interested in producing a more complete theory of life, as well as\nto AI-Safety researchers.\n",

We apply our energy estimation\ntechniques to a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including single- and also\nmulti-threaded embedded programs from two commonly used concurrency patterns,\ntask farms and pipelines. Using SRA, our LLVM IR results demonstrate a high\naccuracy with a deviation in the range of 1% from the ISA SRA.

This\nabstract algebra captures settings where one is interested in the behavior of a\ncomposed system in an environment and wants to abstract away anything internal\nnot relevant for the behavior.

The behavior\nof such a system is uniquely determined by the function mapping inputs to\noutputs. We consider several instantiations of this very general concept. In\nparticular, we show that Kahn networks form a functional system algebra and\nprove their composition-order invariance.\n  Moreover, we define a functional system algebra of causal systems,\ncharacterized by the property that inputs can only influence future outputs,\nwhere an abstract partial order relation captures the notion of \"later\".

More precisely, the increase in organized complexity refers\nhere to the wealth, variety and intricacy of structures, and should not be\nconfused with the increase of random complexity, formalized by Kolmogorov\n(1965). If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity\nwith \"computational content\", then the fundamental cause of the increase of\ncomplexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with\nmemory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In\nthis view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them\nto conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of\ncumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of\nlife. Language, writing, culture, science and technology can also be analyzed\nas computation mechanisms generating, preserving and accelerating the increase\nin organized complexity. The main unifying theme for big history is the energy\nrate density, a metric based on thermodynamics. However useful, this metric\ndoes not provide much insight into the role that information and computation\nplay in our universe. The concept of \"logical depth\" provides a new lens to\nexamine the increase of organized complexity. We argue in this paper that\norganized complexity is a valid and useful way to make sense of big history.\nAdditionally, logical depth has a rigorous formal definition in theoretical\ncomputer science that hints at a broader research program to quantify\ncomplexity in the universe.\n  Keywords: organized complexity, Kolmogorov complexity, logical depth, big\nhistory, cosmic evolution, evolution, complexity, complexification,\ncomputation, artificial life, philosophy of information\n",

Current approaches for quantifying\nthe output accuracy of a localization system in real-time either do not provide\na distance metric, require an extensive training process, and/or are tailored\nto a specific localization system. In this paper, we present the design,\nimplementation, and evaluation of CONE: a novel calibration-free accurate\nconfidence estimation system that can work in real-time with any location\ndetermination system. CONE builds on a sound theoretical model that allows it\nto trade the required user confidence with tight bound on the estimated\nconfidence radius. We also introduce a new metric for evaluating confidence\nestimation systems that can capture new aspects of their performance.\nEvaluation of CONE on Android phones in a typical testbed using the iBeacons\nBLE technology with a side-by-side comparison with traditional confidence\nestimation techniques shows that CONE can achieve a consistent median absolute\nerror difference accuracy of less than 2.7m while estimating the user position\nmore than 80% of the time within the confidence circle.

In Automata Networks, it suffices to say that automata \"influence\" one\nanother to introduce a notion of causality. One might argue that this merely is\nan incidental side effect of preferring statements expressed in natural\nlanguages to mathematical formulae. The discussion of this paper shows that if\nthis is the case, then it is worth considering the effects of those preferences\non the contents of the statements we make and the formulae we derive. And if it\nis not the case, that causality is a mere incidental side effect of our\npreferences of formulation, then causality must be worth some scientific\nattention per se. In any case, the paper illustrates how the innate sense of\ncausality we have may be made deliberate and formal use of without having to\npin down the elusive notion of causality to anything fixed and formal that\nwouldn't do justice to the wide range of ways it is involved in science-making.\n",

Today's apps offload processing and storing contextual information,\nbut this increases response time, often relies on the user's data connection,\nand runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper\nwe motivate the feasibility of on-loading large amounts of context and\nintroduce PACO (Programming Abstraction for Contextual On-loading), an\narchitecture for on-loading data that optimizes for location and time while\nallowing flexibility in storing additional context. The PACO API's innovations\nenable on-loading very dense traces of information, even given devices'\nresource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for\nAndroid, we demonstrate that PACO can support expressive application queries\nentirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses PACO's energy\nconsumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy.

        "summary": "  Nowadays, the ubiquity of various sensors enables the collection of\nvoluminous datasets of car trajectories. Such datasets enable analysts to make\nsense of driving patterns and behaviors: in order to understand the behavior of\ndrivers, one approach is to break a trajectory into its underlying patterns and\nthen analyze that trajectory in terms of derived patterns. The process of\ntrajectory segmentation is a function of various resources including a set of\nground truth trajectories with their driving patterns. To the best of our\nknowledge, no such ground-truth dataset exists in the literature. In this\npaper, we describe a trajectory annotation framework and report our results to\nannotate a dataset of personal car trajectories. Our annotation methodology\nconsists of a crowd-sourcing task followed by a precise process of aggregation.\nOur annotation process consists of two granularity levels, one to specify the\nannotation (segment border) and the other one to describe the type of the\nsegment (e.g. speed-up, turn, merge, etc.). The output of our project, Dataset\nof Annotated Car Trajectories (DACT), is available online at\nhttps://figshare.com/articles/dact_dataset_of_annotated_car_trajectories/5005289 .\n",

To evenly distribute the\ntraffic flow, an advanced driver information system should be aware of the\ntraffic control operations. However, such requirement can not ultimately be\nsatisfied due to the gaps in state of the art in advanced traffic management\nsystems. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed traffic control system,\nin which agents embedded in connected vehicles, traffic signals, urban elements\nand a traffic control center interact with each other to provide a greater\ntraffic fluidity. Therefore, the agents depend strongly on a heterogeneous\nvehicular network. In this sense, this study also proposes a heterogeneous\nvehicular network whose communication protocol can satisfy the communication\nrequirements of intelligent transportation systems service applications.\nAccording to the results obtained from simulations, the distributed traffic\ncontrol system was able to maximize the flow of vehicles and the mean speed of\nthe vehicles, and minimize the wait time, travel time, fuel consume and\nemissions (CO, CO$_2$, HC, NOx and PMx).\n",

Following the increasing trend in\nelectricity generation from renewable sources, pushed by the need to meet\nsustainable energy goals in many countries, more sophisticated control\nstrategies are being adopted to regulate the operation of the electric power\nsystem, driving electrical infrastructures towards the so called Smart Grid\nscenario.

In this context, stochastic model-based\nanalysis are well suited to assess dependability and quality of service related\nindicators, and continuous improvements in modeling strategies and system\nmodels design are required. Thus, my PhD work addresses this topic by\ncontributing to study new Smart Grid scenarios, concerning the advanced\ninterplay between ICT and electrical infrastructures in presence of cyber\nfaults/attacks, define a new modeling approach, based on modularity and\ncomposition, and start to study how to improve the electrical grid dynamics\nrepresentation.

In DDDAS computations and measurements form a dynamic closed\nfeedback loop in which they tune one another in response to changes in the\nenvironment. Our proposed system enables dynamic augmentation of a base\nelectrical mesh topology with an optical express bus during the run-time. In\naddition, the measurement process itself adjusts to the environment.

We evaluate the performance and power of our\nsystem against kernels from NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) in addition to some\nsynthetically generated traffic. In comparison to a 16x16 base electrical mesh,\nD3NOC shows up to 89% latency and 67% dynamic power net improvements beyond\noverhead-corrected performance. It should be noted that the design-space of NoC\nreconfiguration is vast and the goal of this study is not design-space\nexploration.

A practical difficulty\nwith this approach is manual selection procedure, which tends to make model\ndesign process laborious and non-generic. Despite the fact that explanatory\nfeatures provide us with the understanding of a complex process, there has been\nno standard set of features in urban growth prediction over which scholars have\nconsensus. Hence, design and deploying of systems for urban growth prediction\nhave remained challenging tasks. In order to reduce the dependency on human\ndevised features, we have proposed a novel End-to-End prediction framework to\nrepresent remotely sensed satellite data in terms of rules of a cellular\nautomata model in order to improve the performance of urban growth prediction.\nUsing our End-to-End framework, we have achieved superior performance in Figure\nof Merit, Producer's accuracy, User's accuracy, and Overall accuracy metrics\nrespectively over existing learning based methods.\n",

From the point of view of analog\ncomputability, the existence of an effective way to obtain solutions of these\nsystems is essential. A pioneering model of analog computation is the General\nPurpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Shannon as a model of the\nDifferential Analyzer and improved by Pour-El, Lipshitz and Rubel, Costa and\nGra\\c{c}a and others. Its power is known to be characterized by the class of\ndifferentially algebraic functions, which includes the solutions of initial\nvalue problems for ordinary differential equations. We address one of the\nlimitations of this model, concerning the notion of approximability, a\ndesirable property in computation over continuous spaces that is however absent\nin the GPAC. In particular, the Shannon GPAC cannot be used to generate\nnon-differentially algebraic functions which can be approximately computed in\nother models of computation. We extend the class of data types using networks\nwith channels which carry information on a general complete metric space $X$;\nfor example $X=C(R,R)$, the class of continuous functions of one real (spatial)\nvariable. We consider the original modules in Shannon's construction\n(constants, adders, multipliers, integrators) and we add \\emph{(continuous or\ndiscrete) limit} modules which have one input and one output. We then define an\nL-GPAC to be a network built with $X$-stream channels and the above-mentioned\nmodules. This leads us to a framework in which the specifications of such\nanalog systems are given by fixed points of certain operators on continuous\ndata streams.

        "summary": "  Thermoelectric generation (TEG) has increasingly drawn attention for being\nenvironmentally friendly. A few researches have focused on improving TEG\nefficiency at the system level on vehicle radiators. The most recent\nreconfiguration algorithm shows improvement in performance but suffers from\nmajor drawback on computational time and energy overhead, and non-scalability\nin terms of array size and processing frequency. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel TEG array reconfiguration algorithm that determines near-optimal\nconfiguration with an acceptable computational time. More precisely, with\n$O(N)$ time complexity, our prediction-based fast TEG reconfiguration algorithm\nenables all modules to work at or near their maximum power points (MPP).\nAdditionally, we incorporate prediction methods to further reduce the runtime\nand switching overhead during the reconfiguration process. Experimental results\npresent $30\\%$ performance improvement, almost $100\\times$ reduction on\nswitching overhead and $13\\times$ enhancement on computational speed compared\nto the baseline and prior work. The scalability of our algorithm makes it\napplicable to larger scale systems such as industrial boilers and heat\nexchangers.\n",

A relation between the energy consumption and the\nweather conditions would indicate that weather forecast models could be used\nfor predicting energy consumption of DCs. A reliable forecast would result in a\nmore efficient management of the available energy and would make it easier to\ntake advantage of the modern types of power-grid based on renewable energy\nresources. In this ,paper, we exploit the capabilities provided by the\nFIESTA-IoT platform in order to investigate the correlation between the weather\nconditions and the energy consumption in DCs. Then, by using multi-variable\nlinear regression process, we model this correlation between the energy\nconsumption and the dominant weather conditions parameters in order to\neffectively forecast the energy consumption based on the weather forecast. We\nhave validated our results through live measurements from the RealDC testbed.\nResults from our proposed approach indicate that forecasting of energy\nconsumption based on weather conditions could help not only DC operators in\nmanaging their cooling systems and power usage, but also electricity companies\nin optimizing their power distribution systems.\n",

The question consists in discovering every letter\nconstituting the word, points of cutting which separate its grapheme from other\nconstituents of word's shape. The obtained segment must be a complete drawing\nof the represented letter. This segmentation according to contextual graphic\nand qualitative criteria connecting the attached allograph will have to satisfy\ntypographic constraints varying in conformity with the possibilities offered by\nthe wanted technology. In this paper, we develop an approach for segmenting\nArabic word from which the purpose is to extract graphemes respecting the\ndesign of Arabic letters such as it is in the calligraphic literature.

The\nimpact of workload dependent parameters such as workload Working Set Size\n(WSS), request size, request type, access pattern, and sequence of accesses on\nthe failure of SSDs is carefully studied in the presence of realistic power\nfailures. Experimental results over thousands number of fault injections show\nthat data loss occurs even after completion of the request (up to 700ms) where\nthe failure rate is influenced by the type, size, access pattern, and sequence\nof IO accesses while other parameters such as workload WSS has no impact on the\nfailure of SSDs.\n",

        "summary": "  While standard cell layouts are drawn with minimum design rules to maximize\nthe benefit of design area shrinkage, the complicated design rules have caused\ndifficulties with signal routes accessing the pins in standard cell layouts. As\na result, it has become a great challenge for physical layout designers to\ndesign a standard cell layout that is optimized for area, power, timing, signal\nintegrity, and printability. Multiple design iterations are required to\nconsider pin accessibility during standard cells layout to increase the number\nof feasible solutions available to the router. In this work, we will\ndemonstrate several improvements with the Synopsys PAC methodology, such as\nreducing the number of cells required for each Synopsys 'testcell' with the\nsame cell abutment condition, increasing the complexity of the pin connection\nfor better pin accessibility evaluation. We also recommend additional\nconstraints to improve the probability of detecting pin accessibility issues.\nWe also integrate other physical verification methods to access the design rule\ncompliance and the printability of standard cells. We hope that the easy to use\nutility enables layout engineers to perform the verification, simplifying the\nverification methodology.\n",

Existence of lithography weakpoints in a physical layout can\ncause manufacturability issues, which in turn can result in yield losses. In\nour experiments, we have found that specific standard cells have tendencies to\ncreate lithography weakpoints after their cell instances are placed and routed,\neven though each of these cells does not contain any lithography weakpoint\nbefore performing placement and routing. In addition, our experiments have\nshown that abutted standard cell instances can induce lithography weakpoints.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose methodologies that are used in a novel\nsoftware system for checking standard cells in terms of the aforementioned\nlithography issues. Specifically, the software system is capable of detecting\nand sorting problematic standard cells which are prone to generate lithography\nweakpoints, as well as reporting standard cells that should not be abutted.\nMethodologies proposed in this paper allow us to reduce or even prevent the\ngeneration of undesirable lithography weakpoints during the physical synthesis\nphase of designing a digital integrated circuit.\n",

An early detection of potential failures is thus mandated. This has\nencouraged to devise a feedback mechanism from a lower abstraction level of the\ndesign flow to the higher ones, such as placement driven synthesis, routability\n(timing) driven placement etc.\n  Motivated by this, we propose an early global routing framework using pattern\nrouting following the floorplanning stage. We assess feasibility of a floorplan\ntopology of a given design by estimating routability, routed wirelength and\nvias count while addressing the global congestion scenario across the layout.\nDifferent capacity profiles for the routing regions, such as uniform or\nnon-uniform different cases of metal pitch variation across the metals layers\nensures adaptability to technology scaling. The proposed algorithm STAIRoute\ntakes $O(n^2kt)$ time for a given design with $n$ blocks and $k$ nets having at\nmost $t$ terminals. Experimental results on a set of floorplanning benchmark\ncircuits show $100\\%$ routing completion, with no over-congestion in the\nrouting regions reported. The wirelength for the $t$-terminal ($t\\geq$ 2) nets\nis comparable with the Steiner length computed by FLUTE. An estimation on the\nnumber of vias for different capacity profiles is also presented, along with\ncongestion and runtime results.\n",

This starts with placement optimization aimed at improving\nroutability, wirelength, congestion and timing in the design. Contrarily, no\nsuch practice exists on a floorplanned layout, during the early stage of the\ndesign flow. Recently, STAIRoute \\cite{karb2} aimed to address that by\nidentifying the shortest routing path of a net through a set of routing regions\nin the floorplan in multiple metal layers. Since the blocks in hierarchical\nASIC/SoC designs do not use all the permissible routing layers for the internal\nrouting corresponding to standard cell connectivity, the proposed STAIRoute\nframework is not an effective for early global routability assessment. This\nleads to improper utilization of routing area, specifically in higher routing\nlayers with fewer routing blockages, as the lack of placement of standard cells\ndoes not facilitates any routing of their interconnections.\n  This paper presents a generalized model for early global routability\nassessment, HGR, by utilizing the free regions over the blocks beyond certain\nmetal layers. The proposed (hybrid) routing model comprises of (a) the junction\ngraph model in STAIRoute routing through the block boundary regions in lower\nrouting layers, and (ii) the grid graph model for routing in higher layers over\nthe free regions of the blocks.\n  Experiment with the latest floorplanning benchmarks exhibit an average\nreduction of $4\\%$, $54\\%$ and $70\\%$ in netlength, via count, and congestion\nrespectively when HGR is used over STAIRoute. Further, we conducted another\nexperiment on an industrial design flow targeted for $45nm$ process, and the\nresults are encouraging with $~3$X runtime boost when early global routing is\nused in conjunction with the existing physical design flow.\n",

Through the analysis of functional requirements of the\nintelligent household greenhouse system, an intelligent household greenhouse\nsystem is designed with the functions of greenhouse environmental data\ndetection, greenhouse environmental control regulation, data remote\ntransmission and human-computer interaction. Its sensor layer collects\nenvironmental data in real time based on the ZigBee wireless sensor network.\nThe network layer STM32 intelligent gateway coordinates with network server, so\nas to exchange data from sensor layer to application layer, and solve the\nproblems of non-blocking of data sending and receiving as well as concurrent\nrequests of multiple mobile terminals. The application layer is designed into\ntwo types. One is a desktop management system as a data storage and analysis\ncenter, and the other is a mobile terminal APP. At the same time, we design a\ncommunication protocol that is applicable to the interaction of the three-layer\nstructure of the Internet of Things, with the characteristics of simplicity,\nstability, readability, and scalability. It can avoid the mutual influence of\nmulti-level data exchange and ensure the correctness of data circulation. In\nthe design, the system sensor layer ensures stable transmission of various data\nand instructions, and the network layer has a high degree of concurrency and\nreal time. And various measurement and control data of the sensor layer can\ninteract with the data of mobile-terminal equipment of the application layer.\nThe desktop management system and mobile terminal APP can monitor greenhouse\ndata in real time and control various actuators in the greenhouse.\n",

However, analyzing smart meter data\nof millions of customers in a timely manner is quite challenging.

Online controlled experiments (aka AB tests) are\nincreasingly being used to make decisions to improve websites as well as mobile\nand desktop applications. We argue that loss of telemetry data (during upload\nor post-processing) can skew the results of experiments, leading to loss of\nstatistical power and inaccurate or erroneous conclusions. By systematically\ninvestigating the causes of telemetry loss, we argue that it is not practical\nto entirely eliminate it. Consequently, experimentation systems need to be\nrobust to its effects. Furthermore, we note that it is nontrivial to measure\nthe absolute level of telemetry loss in an experimentation system. In this\npaper, we take a top-down approach towards solving this problem. We motivate\nthe impact of loss qualitatively using experiments in real applications\ndeployed at scale, and formalize the problem by presenting a theoretical\nbreakdown of the bias introduced by loss. Based on this foundation, we present\na general framework for quantitatively evaluating the impact of telemetry loss,\nand present two solutions to measure the absolute levels of loss. This\nframework is used by well-known applications at Microsoft, with millions of\nusers and billions of sessions.

In the field of Non-Intrusive Load\nMonitoring (NILM), performance evaluation can be conducted on real-world\naggregate signals, provided by smart energy meters or artificial superpositions\nof individual load signals (i.e., denoised aggregates). It has long been\nsuspected that testing on these denoised aggregates provides better evaluation\nresults mainly due to the the fact that the signal is less complex. Complexity\nin real-world aggregate signals increases with the number of unknown/untracked\nload. Although this is a known performance reporting problem, an investigation\nin the actual performance gap between real and denoised testing is still\npending. In this paper, we examine the performance gap between testing on\nreal-world and denoised aggregates with the aim of bringing clarity into this\nmatter. Starting with an assessment of noise levels in datasets, we find\nsignificant differences in test cases. We give broad insights into our\nevaluation setup comprising three load disaggregation algorithms, two of them\nrelying on neural network architectures. The results presented in this paper,\nbased on studies covering three scenarios with ascending noise levels, show a\nstrong tendency towards load disaggregation algorithms providing significantly\nbetter performance on denoised aggregate signals. A closer look into the\noutcome of our studies reveals that all appliance types could be subject to\nthis phenomenon.

While a great effort has been made to modeling its control logic by\nassuming an ideal communication and positioning infrastructure, the\narchitectural dimension and the influence of pedestrian positioning uncertainty\nhave been largely overlooked. In our previous research, a Cell-based crowd\nevacuation system (CellEVAC) was proposed that dynamically allocates exit gates\nto pedestrians in a cell-based pedestrian positioning infrastructure. This\nsystem provides optimal exit-choice indications through color-based indications\nand a control logic module built upon an optimized discrete-choice model. Here,\nwe investigate how location-aware technologies and wearable devices can be used\nfor a realistic deployment of CellEVAC. We consider a simulated real evacuation\nscenario (Madrid Arena) and propose a system architecture for CellEVAC that\nincludes: a controller node, a radio-controlled LED wristband subsystem, and a\ncell-node network equipped with active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)\ndevices. These subsystems coordinate to provide control, display and\npositioning capabilities. We quantitatively study the sensitivity of evacuation\ntime and safety to uncertainty in the positioning system. Results showed that\nCellEVAC was operational within a limited range of positioning uncertainty.\nFurther analyses revealed that reprogramming the control logic module through a\nsimulation-optimization process, simulating the positioning system's expected\nuncertainty level, improved the CellEVAC performance in scenarios with poor\npositioning systems.\n",

The emulation results are compared to other verification\nmethodologies (RTL Simulation, Simulation Acceleration, and Transaction-based\nemulation), and found to be 82% faster than regular RTL simulation. In\naddition, the emulation runs in the MHz speed range, allowing the incorporation\nof software applications, drivers, and operating systems, as opposed to the Hz\nrange in RTL simulation or sub-megahertz range as accomplished in\ntransaction-based emulation. In addition, the integration of scan testing and\nacceleration/emulation platforms allows more complex DFT methods to be\ndeveloped and tested on a large scale system, decreasing the time to market for\nproducts.\n",

However, despite these advancements, two\ncore challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances\nand ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These\nchallenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of\nappliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches\nhave attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high\nsampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number\nof sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using\ncommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an\ninexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use\nthe reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in\nPLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for\nan appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on\ntype and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC\nmodems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.\n",

The\ninteraction between the system and the measuring apparatus of the experimenter\nis examined both from the perspectives of decoherence and the quantum Zeno\neffect. These ideas are used as context to address the question of limits to\nmachine consciousness.\n",

        "summary": "  A new trend in medicine is the use of algorithms to analyze big datasets,\ne.g. using everything your phone measures about you for diagnostics or\nmonitoring. However, these algorithms are commonly compared against weak\nbaselines, which may contribute to excessive optimism. To assess how well an\nalgorithm works, scientists typically ask how well its output correlates with\nmedically assigned scores. Here we perform a meta-analysis to quantify how the\nliterature evaluates their algorithms for monitoring mental wellbeing. We find\nthat the bulk of the literature ($\\sim$77%) uses meaningless comparisons that\nignore patient baseline state. For example, having an algorithm that uses phone\ndata to diagnose mood disorders would be useful. However, it is possible to\nover 80% of the variance of some mood measures in the population by simply\nguessing that each patient has their own average mood - the patient-specific\nbaseline. Thus, an algorithm that just predicts that our mood is like it\nusually is can explain the majority of variance, but is, obviously, entirely\nuseless. Comparing to the wrong (population) baseline has a massive effect on\nthe perceived quality of algorithms and produces baseless optimism in the\nfield. To solve this problem we propose \"user lift\" that reduces these\nsystematic errors in the evaluation of personalized medical monitoring.\n",

Both CS1 and CS2 at the\nUniversity of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) are taught in Python with annual\nenrollments of 300 and 150 respectively. In this paper, we report on the\nfollowing research questions: 1) Are CS1 grades indicators of CS2 grades? 2)\nDoes a quantitative relationship exist between CS2 course grade and a modified\nversion of the SCS1 concept inventory? 3) What are the most challenging aspects\nof CS2, and how well does CS1 prepare students for CS2 from the student's\nperspective? We provide a quantitative analysis of 2300 CS1 and CS2 course\ngrades from 2013--2019. In Spring 2019, we administered a modified version of\nthe SCS1 concept inventory to 44 students in the first week of CS2. Further, 69\nstudents completed an exit questionnaire at the conclusion of CS2 to gain\nqualitative student feedback on their challenges in CS2 and on how well CS1\nprepared them for CS2. We find that 56% of students' grades were lower in CS2\nthan CS1, 18% improved their grades, and 26% earned the same grade. Of the\nchanges, 62% were within one grade point. We find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between the modified SCS1 score and CS2 grade points. Students\nidentify linked lists and class/object concepts among the most challenging.\nStudent feedback on CS2 challenges and the adequacy of their CS1 preparations\nidentify possible avenues for improving the CS1-CS2 transition.\n",

The virtual reality concept is\nfamiliar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is\nusually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the\nworld could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional\nspace-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information,\nmatter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the\nmany conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If\nthe universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no\nlonger be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is\nsuggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality\nis a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how\ncore physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could\nderive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity\nand quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates\nspace-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.\n",

Treatment planning\nand seed implanting are most often based on the intensive use of transrectal\nultrasound (TRUS) imaging. This is not easy because prostate visualization is\ndifficult in this imaging modality particularly as regards the apex of the\ngland and from an intra- and interobserver variability standpoint. Radioactive\nseeds are implanted inside open interventional MR machines in some centers.\nSince MRI was shown to be sensitive and specific for prostate imaging whilst\nopen MR is prohibitive for most centers and makes surgical procedures very\ncomplex, this work suggests bringing the MR virtually in the operating room\nwith MRI/TRUS data fusion. This involves providing the physician with\nbi-modality images (TRUS plus MRI) intended to improve treatment planning from\nthe data registration stage. The paper describes the method developed and\nimplemented in the PROCUR system. Results are reported for a phantom and first\nseries of patients. Phantom experiments helped characterize the accuracy of the\nprocess. Patient experiments have shown that using MRI data linked with TRUS\ndata improves TRUS image segmentation especially regarding the apex and base of\nthe prostate. This may significantly modify prostate volume definition and have\nan impact on treatment planning.\n",

The calibration matrix is retrieved by detection of a membrane plane\nin a dozen of US acquisitions of the phantom. Plane detection is robustly\nperformed with the 2-D Hough transformation. The feature extraction process is\nfully automated, calibration requires about 20 minutes and the calibration\nsystem can be used in a clinical context. The precision of the system was\nevaluated to a root mean square (RMS) distance error of 1.15mm and to an RMS\nangular error of 0.61 degrees.

Excessive moisture content can affect in a negative way building\nprocesses such as the installation of wooden floors or the use of wood as a\nstructural material. Moisture meters can provide prompt and non-destructive\ndetermination of wood moisture, and as such are among the most useful tools\navailable to wood products manufacturers and scientists. However, a continuous\nmonitoring system is needed in order to avoid excessive moisture content which\ncan damage wooden floors as well as structural wood. Data and procedures are\npresented in order to develop a suitable monitoring tool based on wireless\nsensor networks to provide an electronic tool of active security both for the\ninstallation of wooden floors and for the proper maintenance of existent\nbuildings which have a timber structure.\n",

In such parts, tool\npaths generated for bottom machining feature with the conventional parallel\nplane strategy induced many feed rate reductions, especially when boundaries of\nthe feature have a lot of curvatures and are not parallel. Several machining\nexperiments on hardened material lead to the conclusion that a tool path\nimplying stable cutting conditions might guarantee a better part surface\nintegrity. To ensure this stability, the shape machined must be decomposed when\nconventional strategies are not suitable. In this paper, an experimental\napproach based on high-speed performance simulation is conducted on a master\nbottom machining feature in order to highlight the influence of the curvatures\ntowards a suitable decomposition of machining area. The decomposition is\nachieved through the construction of intermediate curves between the closed\nboundaries of the feature. These intermediate curves are used as guidance curve\nfor the tool paths generation with an alternative machining strategy called\n\"guidance curve strategy\". For the construction of intermediate curves, key\nparameters reflecting the influence of their proximity with each closed\nboundary and the influence of the curvatures of this latter are introduced.\nBased on the results, a method for defining guidance curves in four steps is\nproposed.\n",

        "summary": "  Historically, VLSI designers have focused on increasing the speed and\nreducing the area of digital systems. However, the evolution of portable\nsystems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought\npower dissipation as another critical design factor. Low power design reduces\ncooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems.\nMoreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power\ndissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since\ndynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd,\nlowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold\nvoltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance. In case\nof static power, the power is consumed during the steady state condition i.e\nwhen there are no input/output transitions. Static power has two sources: DC\npower and Leakage power. Consecutively to facilitate voltage scaling without\ndisturbing the performance, threshold voltage has to be minimized. Furthermore\nit leads to better noise margins and helps to avoid the hot carrier effects in\nshort channel devices. In this paper we have been proposed the new CMOS library\nfor the complex digital design using scaling the supply voltage and device\ndimensions and also suggest the methods to control the leakage current to\nobtain the minimum power dissipation at optimum value of supply voltage and\ntransistor threshold. In this paper CMOS Cell library has been implemented\nusing TSMC (0.18um) and TSMC (90nm) technology using HEP2 tool of IC designing\nfrom Mentor Graphics for various analysis and simulations.\n",

The main result is the twofold case of 3 speeds.\nOn the one hand, we prove that accumulations cannot happen when all ratios\nbetween speeds and all ratios between initial distances are rational. On the\nother hand, we provide examples of an accumulation in the case of an irrational\nratio between 2 speeds and in the case of an irrational ratio between two\ndistances in the initial configuration. This dichotomy is explained by the\npresence of a phenomenon computing Euclid's algorithm (gcd): it stops if and\nonly if its input is commensurate (ie, of rational ratio).\n",

Fairness or\ngranularity consistency is one of the major limitations affecting the quality\nof ontology tree. This limitation refers to inequality of semantic similarity\nin the most ontology trees. In other words, semantic similarity of every two\nadjacent nodes is unequal in these trees. It deteriorates the performance of\ncontexts similarity computation. We overcome this limitation by weighting tree\nedges based on their semantic similarity. Weight of each edge is computed using\nNormalized Similarity Score (NSS) method. This method is based on frequencies\nof concepts (words) co-occurrences in the pages indexed by search engines.

Many energy disaggregation algorithms have been proposed to detect\nvarious individual appliances from one aggregated signal observation. However,\nfew works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle (EV)\ncharging in the residential environment since EVs charging at home has emerged\nonly recently. Recent studies showed that EV charging has a large impact on\nsmart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, EV charging monitoring has become a\nmore important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this\npaper, we present a novel method to disaggregate EV charging signals from\naggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate\ninterference coming from air-conditioner (AC), enabling accurate EV charging\ndetection and energy estimation under the presence of AC power signals.\nBesides, the proposed algorithm requires no training, demands a light\ncomputational load, delivers high estimation accuracy, and works well for data\nrecorded at the low sampling rate 1/60 Hz. When the algorithm is tested on\nreal-world data recorded from 11 houses over about a whole year (total 125\nmonths worth of data), the averaged error in estimating energy consumption of\nEV charging is 15.7 kwh/month (while the true averaged energy consumption of EV\ncharging is 208.5 kwh/month), and the averaged normalized mean square error in\ndisaggregating EV charging load signals is 0.19.\n",

Moreover: (i) the peak rail capacity of Port Botany is 1.78\nmillion TEU per annum; over six times higher than 2011/12 rail volumes; (ii)\nthere are no infrastructural impediments to the achievement of peak rail\ncapacity; (iii) operational changes, not infrastructural investment, are the\nkey to unlocking the potential of the port; (iv) Port Botany is well positioned\nto handle projected increases in container volumes over the next decade and\nbeyond, including the 28% rail mode share target established by the New South\nWales State Government.\n",

In this\napplication, promptly finding out the missing event is of paramount importance.\nHowever, existing missing tag detection protocols cannot efficiently handle the\npresence of a large number of unexpected tags whose IDs are not known to the\nreader, which shackles the time efficiency. To deal with the problem of\ndetecting missing tags in the presence of unexpected tags, this paper\nintroduces a two-phase Bloom filter-based missing tag detection protocol\n(BMTD). The proposed BMTD exploits Bloom filter in sequence to first deactivate\nthe unexpected tags and then test the membership of the expected tags, thus\ndampening the interference from the unexpected tags and considerably reducing\nthe detection time. Moreover, the theoretical analysis of the protocol\nparameters is performed to minimize the detection time of the proposed BMTD and\nachieve the required reliability simultaneously. Extensive experiments are then\nconducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed BMTD. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed BMTD significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art solutions.\n",

Whenever the impulsive interference happens, the\nsubband scale functions can sharply drop the step size, which eliminate the\ninfluence of outliers on the tap-weight vector update. Therefore, the proposed\nalgorithms are robust against impulsive interferences, and exhibit the faster\nconvergence rate and better tracking capability than the sign SAF (SSAF)\nalgorithm.

At this abstraction level, a timed sequence\nofpertinent \"events\" input to a system (or internal, in the case of timeouts)\ncause instantaneous changes to the state of the system. Between events, the\nstate does not change, resulting in a a piecewise constant state trajectory.\nMain advantages of DEVS are its rigorous formal definition, and its support for\nmodular composition.\n  This chapter introduces the Classic DEVS formalism in a bottom-up fashion,\nusing a simple traffic light example. The syntax and operational semantics of\nAtomic (i.e., non-hierarchical) models are intruced first. The semantics of\nCoupled (hierarchical) models is then given by translation into Atomic DEVS\nmodels. As this formal \"flattening\" is not efficient, a modular abstract\nsimulator which operates directly on the coupled model is also presented. This\nis the common basis for subsequent efficient implementations. We continue to\nactual applications of DEVS modelling and simulation, as seen in performance\nanalysis for queueing systems. Finally, we present some of the shortcomings in\nthe Classic DEVS formalism, and show solutions to them in the form of variants\nof the original formalism.\n",

The set of bars\n(i.e. intervals) representing birth and death times of k-dimensional holes\nalong such sequence is called the persistence barcode. k-Dimensional holes with\nshort lifetimes are informally considered to be \"topological noise\", and those\nwith long lifetimes are considered to be \"topological features\" associated to\nthe filtration. Persistent entropy is defined as the Shannon entropy of the\npersistence barcode of a given filtration. In this paper we present new\nimportant properties of persistent entropy of Cech and Vietoris-Rips\nfiltrations. Among the properties, we put a focus on the stability theorem that\nallows to use persistent entropy for comparing persistence barcodes. Later, we\nderive a simple method for separating topological noise from features in\nVietoris-Rips filtrations.\n",

While\nmulti-level approaches, surgical process modeling and other workflow analysis\nmethods exist, this is to our knowledge the first quantitative approach.\nMethods: Inspired by the group decision making problem from the field of\noperational research, we define event impact factors, which combine independent\nand very diverse low-level functions. This allows us to rate surgical events by\ntheir importance. Results: We conducted surveys with 4 surgeons to determine\nthe importance of roles, phases and their combinations within a laparoscopic\ncholecystectomy. Applying this data on a recorded surgery, we showed that it is\npossible to define a quantitative measure for deciding on acception or\nrejection of calls to different roles and at different phases of surgery.\nConclusions: This methodology allows us to use components such as expertise and\nrole of the surgical staff and other aspects of a given surgery in order to\nquantitatively analyze and evaluate events, actions, user interfaces or\nprocedures.\n",

The identification of correct potential\noutliers had already been an open problem proposed in literature. This is due\nto the fact that they pinpoint areas and time frames where traffic\nincidents/accidents occur along the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) in Luzon. In\nthis paper, potential outliers are classified into (1) absolute potential\noutliers; (2) valid potential outliers; and (3) ambiguous potential outliers\nthrough the use of confidence bands and confidence ellipse. A method is also\ndescribed to validate cluster membership of identified ambiguous potential\noutliers. Using the 2006 NLEX Balintawak Northbound (BLK-NB) data set, we were\nable to identify two absolute potential outliers, nine valid potential\noutliers, and five ambiguous potential outliers. In a literature where Vector\nFusion was used, 10 potential outliers were identified.

The goal is unattainable because the means\nchosen for its accomplishment are mutually inconsistent and contradictory:\n\"Computational\" implies data processing ability while \"Intelligence\" implies\nthe ability to process information. In the research community, there is a lack\nof interest in data versus information divergence. The cause of this\nindifference is the Shannon's Information theory, which has dominated the\nscientific community since the early 1950s. However, today it is clear that\nShannon's theory is applicable only to a specific case of data communication\nand is inapplicable to the majority of other occasions, where information about\nsemantic properties of a message must be taken into account. The paper will try\nto explain the devastating results of overlooking some of these very important\nissues - what is intelligence, what is semantic information, how they are\ninterrelated and what happens when the relationship is disregarded.\n",

In this paper we investigate the ratio of two random number generators\nas an alternative approach: the smaller of two input random numbers is divided\nby the larger, resulting in a rational number from $[0,1]$.\n  We investigate theoretical properties of this approach and show that it\nyields a good approximation to the ideal uniform distribution. To evaluate the\nempirical properties we use the well-known test suite \\textsc{TestU01}. We\napply the ratio transformation to moderately bad generators, i.e. those that\nfailed up to 40\\% of the tests from the test battery \\textsc{Crush} of\n\\textsc{TestU01}. We show that more than half of them turn into very good\ngenerators that pass all tests of \\textsc{Crush} and \\textsc{BigCrush} from\n\\textsc{TestU01} when the ratio transformation is applied. In particular,\ngenerators based on linear operations seem to benefit from the ratio, as this\nbreaks up some of the unwanted regularities in the input sequences. Thus the\nadditional effort to produce a second random number and to calculate the ratio\nallows to increase the quality of available random number generators.\n",

Analog circuits operate on analog quantities that are continuous in\nvalue, whereas digital circuits operate on digital quantities that are discrete\nin value and limited in precision. In practice, most digital systems contain\ncombinational circuits along with memory; these systems are known as sequential\ncircuits. Sequential circuits are of two types: synchronous and asynchronous.\nIn a synchronous sequential circuit, a clock signal is used at discrete\ninstants of time to synchronize desired operations. Asynchronous sequential\ncircuits do not require synchronizing clock pulses; however, the completion of\nan operation signals the start of the next operation in sequence. The basic\nlogic design steps are generally identical for sequential and combinational\ncircuits; these are specification, formulation, optimization, and the\nimplementation of the optimized equations using a suitable hardware technology.\nThe differences between sequential and combinational design steps appear in the\ndetails of each step. The minimization (optimization) techniques used in logic\ndesign range from simple (manual) to complex (automated). An example of manual\noptimization methods is the Karnough map (K-map). Indeed, hardware\nimplementation technology has been growing faster than the ability of designers\nto produce hardware designs. Hence, there has been a growing interest in\ndeveloping techniques and tools that facilitate the process of logic design.\n",

Significant differences are detected\nbetween the primes and the non primes. The BiEntropic prime density is shown to\nbe quadratic with a very small Gaussian distributed error. The work is repeated\nin binary using a monte carlo simulation for a sample of the natural numbers <\n2^32 and in trinary for all natural numbers < 3^9 with similar but cubic\nresults. We find a significant relationship between BiEntropy and TriEntropy\nsuch that we can discriminate between the primes and numbers divisible by six.\nWe discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these results and show how they\ngeneralise to give a tight bound on the variance of Pi(x) - Li(x) for all x.\nThis bound is much tighter than the bound given by Von Koch in 1901 as an\nequivalence for proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. Since the primes are Gaussian\ndue to a simple induction on the binary derivative, this implies that the twin\nprimes conjecture is true. We also provide absolutely convergent asymptotes for\nthe numbers of Fermat and Mersenne primes in the appendices.\n",

One of the most important criteria for determining the\nsuitability of a building for rooftop solar is the current age of its roof. The\nreason for this is simple -- because rooftop solar installations are\nlong-lived, the roof needs to be new enough to last for the lifetime of the\nsolar array or old enough to justify being replaced. In this paper we present a\ndata-driven method for determining the age of a roof from historical satellite\nimagery, which removes one of the last obstacles to a fully automated pipeline\nfor rooftop solar site selection. We estimate that a full solution to this\nproblem would reduce customer acquisition costs for rooftop solar by\n$\\sim$20\\%, leading to an additional $\\sim$750 megatons of CO$_2$ displaced\nbetween 2020 and 2050.\n",

Computability\ntheory is a particular example: programs can be numbered and all sorts of\nlimits can be studied from there. Computability is also at the heart of science\nsince any experimental validation of a theory supposes that theoretical results\nhave been computed, then checked against concrete experiments. It implies that\nlimitations on what is computable ultimately are also limits of what we\nunderstand as \"scientific theory\", and more generally to all the transmissible\nknowledge.

The main intention of the BI is to enhance the\nemployees' knowledge with information that allows them to make decisions to\nachieve its organisational strategies. However only twenty percent of data\nexist in structured form, majority of banks knowledge is in unstructured or\nminds of its employees. Organizations are needed to integrate KM with Knowledge\nwhich is discovered from data and information. The purpose of this paper is to\ndiscuss the need of business insiders in the process of knowledge discovery and\ndistribution, to make BI more relevant to business of the bank. We have also\ndiscussed about the BI/KM applications in banking industry and provided a\nframework to integrate BI and KM in banking industry.\n",

Sourcing and outsourcing are\npositioned as different areas of activity, neither one of which is subsumed\nunder the other one. It is argued that competences relevant for outsourcing are\nmainly community based rather than evidence based. Subjective ability and\nobjective ability are distinguished as categories, together making up ability,\nwhich are distinct but not necessarily disjoint from competence. Conjectural\nability is introduced as a form of subjective ability. A person's competence\nprofile includes competences as well as abilities, including subjective ones.\nCompetence assessment and acquisition as well as the impact of assessed\ncompetence on practical work is described. The analysis of competence and\nability thus developed is used as standpoint from which to extract a\nspecification of an audience for a theory of outsourcing, yet to be written.\nMoreover, it allows to formulate requirements for and in preparation of the\ndevelopment of an outsourcing theory. Formulating these requirements is done\nunder the assumption that a person's awareness of a theory of outsourcing is\nexpected to strengthen that person's outsourcing competence profile.\n",

In the globalized world the importance of Information Systems (IS)\nand Information Technology (IT) become increasingly relevant regarding the\nrequirements imposed by competition. Both the knowledge of the business as the\nrapid flow of information are fundamental for a enterprise decision making.\nWhereas the basic definition of IT = hardware + software, i.e., tools that has\nbeen used to create, store and disseminate data and information in the creation\nof knowledge, and IS = IT + People + procedures that collect, process and\ndisseminate the information to support decision making, coordination, control,\nanalysis and visualization in the organization [01], it makes implicit the\nunderstanding of IS is essential to create competitive companies, to manage\nglobal corporations and provide customers with products and services of value.\nIn this work we are correlating IS with the governance of management of an\necosystem. Yet, as IT is redefining the foundations of business, then the\ncustomer service, operations, strategies of product marketing and its\ndistribution and even the knowledge management (KM) depends very much, or\nsometimes even completely, on the IS. The IT and its costs have become a part\nof day-to-day business [02]. In order to meet this complexity of business\nneeds, today is not possible to disregard the IT and its available resources,\nwhich makes very dificult to draw up IS. Therefore, the perspective view of the\nSociotehcnical Aspects of an IS are directly concerned with governance and the\nmodel proposed regarding an ecosystem. Finally, whereas the summary above, the\nmain objective of this opinion paper is to propose the guidelines for a\nSociotechnical Management Model of Governance for an Ecosystem.\n",

In this paper, we present CrowdInside: a crowdsourcing-based\nsystem for the automatic construction of buildings floorplans. CrowdInside\nleverages the smart phones sensors that are ubiquitously available with humans\nwho use a building to automatically and transparently construct accurate motion\ntraces. These accurate traces are generated based on a novel technique for\nreducing the errors in the inertial motion traces by using the points of\ninterest in the indoor environment, such as elevators and stairs, for error\nresetting. The collected traces are then processed to detect the overall\nfloorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and\ncorridors shapes along with a variety of points of interest in the environment.\nImplementation of the system in two testbeds, using different Android phones,\nshows that CrowdInside can detect the points of interest accurately with 0.2%\nfalse positive rate and 1.3% false negative rate. In addition, the proposed\nerror resetting technique leads to more than 12 times enhancement in the median\ndistance error compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the detailed\nfloorplan can be accurately estimated with a a relatively small number of\ntraces. This number is amortized over the number of users of the building. We\nalso discuss possible extensions to CrowdInside for inferring even higher level\nsemantics about the discovered floorplans.\n",

Digital Home System is combination of automated services i.e. Electronic\nDevice Controller, IR Security System, Web Desktop, Remote Video Surveillance\nSystem and Virtual Mobile by which we can control our home by avoiding old\nmanual processes e.g. our physical presence at home is optional. The System\nprovides some of the modern luxury & security features to us. Now we can\ncontrol Light, fan, AC or any electronic devices by voice command, Blue-tooth,\nGPRS or Website. To control the system remotely, GPRS connectivity is added. We\ncan also monitor our home from remote area by using Remote Video Surveillance\nSystem. This enables live video into mobile device of the digital home.\nMoreover, we can also access our PC and do the necessary tasks from any\ninternet enabled computer in the world by using Web Desktop which is specially\nbuilt for this purpose. Furthermore, access of unauthorized person in the home\nwill be notified by SMS & store the image of the person and also generate a\nvoice alarm. So that ensures the security of our valuable things.

Now the meter\nreader people goes to each meter and take the meter reading manually to issue\nthe bill which will later be entered in the billing software for billing and\npayment automation. If the manual meter reading and bill data entry process can\nbe automated then it would reduced the laborious task and financial wastage.\n\"Automatic Electric Meter Reading (AMR) System\" is a metering system that is to\nbe used for data collecting from the meter and processing the collected data\nfor billing and other decision purposes.

In this AMR system there are four basic units. They are reading\nunit, communication unit, data receiving and processing unit and billing\nsystem. For reading unit we identified the disk rotation of the energy meter\nand stored the data in microcontroller. So it is not required to change the\ncurrent analog energy meter. An external module will be added with the current\nenergy meter. In the communication unit Wimax transceiver was used for wireless\ncommunication between meter end and the server end because of its wide coverage\narea. In the data receiving and processing unit meter reading will be collected\nfrom the transceiver which is controlled by another microcontroller. There will\nbe a computer application that will take the data from the microcontroller.\nThis will also help to avoid any tampering or break down of energy meter. There\nare various AMR system exists all over the world. Those systems were analyzed\nand we found they are not feasible for Bangladesh.\n",

Although there are methods for visualizing\nthe solutions in the design space, they do not provide any information about\ntheir relationship. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that allows\nthe visualization of the non-dominated solutions in the design space and their\nrelationships by means of a network. The nodes represent the solutions in the\nobjective space, while the edges show the relationships between the solutions\nin the design space. Our proposal (called moGrams) thus provides a joint\nvisualization of both objective and design spaces. It aims at helping the\ndecision maker to get more understanding of the problem so that (s)he can\nchoose the more appropriate final solution. moGrams can be applied to any\nmulticriteria problem in which the solutions are related by a similarity\nmetric. Besides, the decision maker interaction is facilitated by modifying the\nnetwork based on the current preferences to obtain a clearer view. An\nexhaustive experimental study is performed using three multiobjective problems\nin order to show both the usefulness and versatility of moGrams. The results\nexhibit interesting characteristics of our methodology for visualizing and\nanalyzing solutions of multiobjective problems.\n",

        "summary": "  This work deals with the portability of greenhouse models, as we believe that\nthis is a challenge to their practical usage in control strategies under\nproduction conditions. We address this task by means of adaptive neural\nnetworks, which re-adjust their weights when transferred to new conditions.\nSuch an adaptive account for computational models is typical of the field of\ndevelopmental robotics, which investigates learning of motor control in\nartificial systems inspired on infants development. Similarly to robots,\ngreenhouses are complex systems comprising technical and biological elements,\nwhose state can be measured and modified through control actions. We present an\nadaptive model architecture to perform online learning on greenhouse models.\nThis learning process makes use of an episodic memory and of online\nre-training. This allows for adaptation without the need for a complete new\ntraining, which might be prohibitive if the data under the new conditions is\nscarce. Current experiments focus on how a model of tomato photosynthesis,\ndeveloped in a research facility, can adapt itself to a new environment in a\nproduction greenhouse. Further research will focus on model plasticity by means\nof adaptive learning rates and management of the episodic memory described in\nthis paper. The models presented as a proof-of-concept estimate the\ntranspiration and photosynthesis of a hydroponic tomato crop by using\nmeasurements of the climate as inputs. The models are trained and tested using\ndata from a greenhouse in Berlin, Germany. Thereafter, the adaptive\narchitecture is fed with data from a production greenhouse in southern Germany,\nwhere other tomato varieties were grown under different irrigation and climate\nstrategies. The proposed adaptive architecture represents a promising tool for\nspreading the use of models produced by high-tech research centers to the\ngreenhouse production sector.\n",

In this context these\ncircuits are often used for metastability handling, as well. However, like any\nother positive feedback circuit, a Schmitt-Trigger can become metastable\nitself. Therefore, its own metastable behavior must be well understood; in\nparticular the conditions that may cause its metastability. In this paper we\nwill build on existing results from Marino to show that (a) a monotonic input\nsignal can cause late transitions but never leads to a non-digital voltage at\nthe Schmitt-Trigger output, and (b) a non-monotonic input can pin the\nSchmitt-Trigger output to a constant voltage at any desired (also non-digital)\nlevel for an arbitrary duration. In fact, the output can even be driven to any\nwaveform within the dynamic limits of the system. We will base our analysis on\na mathematical model of a Schmitt-Trigger's dynamic behavior and perform SPICE\nsimulations to support our theory and confirm its validity for modern CMOS\nimplementations.

[IEEE TC 2016] proved that pure and inertial delays, which are employed for\ndynamic timing analysis in state-of-the-art tools like ModelSim, NC-Sim and\nVCS, do not yield faithful digital circuit models. Involution delays, which are\nbased on delay functions that are mathematical involutions depending on the\nprevious-output-to-input time offset, were introduced by F\\\"ugger et al.\n[DATE'15] as a faithful alternative (that can easily be used with existing\ntools). Although involution delays were shown to predict real signal traces\nreasonably accurately, any model with a deterministic delay function is\nnaturally limited in its modeling power. In this paper, we thus extend the\ninvolution model, by adding non-deterministic delay variations (random or even\nadversarial), and prove analytically that faithfulness is not impaired by this\ngeneralization. Albeit the amount of non-determinism must be considerably\nrestricted to ensure this property, the result is surprising: the involution\nmodel differs from non-faithful models mainly in handling fast glitch trains,\nwhere small delay shifts have large effects. This originally suggested that\nadding even small variations should break the faithfulness of the model, which\nturned out not to be the case.

Moreover, these statistics are correlated to poor verification\nand validation processes used by hobbyists satellite developers because major\nspace agencies keep high successful ratings even with small/nano satellites\nmissions due to its rigorous V\\&V processes. Aiming to improve payloads\nintegration testing of NanosatC-BR-2, a 2-U Cubesat based nanosatellite under\ndevelopment by INPE, the fault injection technique has been used. It is very\nuseful technique to test systems prototypes. We present the design and\nimplementation of a Failure Emulator Mechanism (FEM) on I2C communication bus\nfor testing the interaction among the NCBR2 subsystems, supporting\ninteroperability and robustness requirements verification. The FEM is modelled\nto work at the communication bus emulating eventual faults of the communicating\nsubsystems in the messages exchanged. Using an Arduino board for the FEM and NI\nLabView environment it is possible to program the mechanism to inject different\nfaults at the I2C bus during different operation modes. Based on a serial\narchitecture, the FEM will be able to intercept all messages and implement\ndifferent faults as service and timing faults. The FEM interface with the\ntester is designed in LabView environment. Control and observation facilities\nare available to generate and upload the faultload script to FEM Arduino board.\nThe proposed FEM architecture and its implementation are validated using two\nsubsystems under testing prototypes: the OnBoard Data Handling Computer and the\nLangmuir Probe NCBR2 payload. For this analysis purpose, the prototypes\nsimulate in two different Arduinos boards the expected behavior of each\nsubsystem in the communication.\n",

Consequently, larger\namounts of data must be acquired and processed by the beamformer. The\nsignificant growth in the amounts of data effects both machinery size and power\nconsumption. Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems\nreduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected\nsignals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate\nreduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite\nRate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which\ncombines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in\nCompressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual\ntransducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is\nlimited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous\nparameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the\nlow-rate samples. In our work, we manage to achieve such SNR enhancement, by\nbeamforming the sub-Nyquist samples obtained from multiple elements. We refer\nto this process as \"compressed beamforming\". Applying it to cardiac ultrasound\ndata, we successfully image macroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly\neight-fold reduction in sample-rate, compared to standard techniques.\n",

One of the steps in the reconfiguration process involves a\nremote lookup to discover the service(s) based on context. This remote lookup\nprocess provides the largest contribution to reconfiguration time and this is\ndue to fact that the remote calls are much slower than local calls.\nConsequently, it affects system performance. In pervasive computing\napplications, this may turn out to be undesirable in terms of user experience.\nMoreover, other distributed applications using the network may be affected as\nevery remote method call decreases the amount of bandwidth available on the\nnetwork.

In this paper we have taken the data\nmining based frequent pattern graph model to define the association and\nsequencing between the words and then adopted the Ant Colony Optimization, an\nartificial intelligence approach, to derive a searching technique to obtain an\nefficient and optimized learning path to reach to a unknown term.\n",

The information view transformation is about reorganizing and\nreengineering the existing information to be used for the day to day activities\nand reporting to support decision making. For reporting purpose, service\nproviders have to invest in Business Intelligence solutions. For which the main\npurpose is to provide the right information in a timely manner to efficiently\nsupport the decision making.

Further, flops are getting cheaper\nwhile the energy cost of data movement is increasingly dominant. The\nunderstanding and characterization of data locality properties of computations\nis critical in order to guide efforts to enhance data locality. Reuse distance\nanalysis of memory address traces is a valuable tool to perform data locality\ncharacterization of programs. A single reuse distance analysis can be used to\nestimate the number of cache misses in a fully associative LRU cache of any\nsize, thereby providing estimates on the minimum bandwidth requirements at\ndifferent levels of the memory hierarchy to avoid being bandwidth bound.\nHowever, such an analysis only holds for the particular execution order that\nproduced the trace. It cannot estimate potential improvement in data locality\nthrough dependence preserving transformations that change the execution\nschedule of the operations in the computation. In this article, we develop a\nnovel dynamic analysis approach to characterize the inherent locality\nproperties of a computation and thereby assess the potential for data locality\nenhancement via dependence preserving transformations. The execution trace of a\ncode is analyzed to extract a computational directed acyclic graph (CDAG) of\nthe data dependences. The CDAG is then partitioned into convex subsets, and the\nconvex partitioning is used to reorder the operations in the execution trace to\nenhance data locality. The approach enables us to go beyond reuse distance\nanalysis of a single specific order of execution of the operations of a\ncomputation in characterization of its data locality properties. It can serve a\nvaluable role in identifying promising code regions for manual transformation,\nas well as assessing the effectiveness of compiler transformations for data\nlocality enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a\nnumber of benchmarks, including case studies where the potential shown by the\nanalysis is exploited to achieve lower data movement costs and better\nperformance.\n",

Noticeably, a trend is those\nservice providers are trying to reduce their carbon emissions by utilizing\non-site or off-site renewable energy in their datacenters in order to attract\nmore customers. With such efforts have been paid, there are still some users\nwho are aggressively calling for even cleaner Internet services. For example,\nover 500,000 Facebook users petitioned the social networking site to use\nrenewable energy to power its datacenter. However, it seems impossible for such\ndemand to be satisfied merely from the inside of those production datacenters,\nconsidering the transition cost and stability. Outside the existing Internet\nservices, on the other hand, may easily set up a proxy service to attract those\nrenewable-energy-sensitive users, by 1) using carbon neutral or even\nover-offsetting cloud instances to bridge the end user and traditional Internet\nservices; and 2) estimating and offsetting the carbon emissions from the\ntraditional Internet services. In our paper, we proposed GreenMail, which is a\ngeneral IMAP proxy caching system that connects email users and traditional\nemail services. GreenMail runs on green web hosts to cache users' emails on\ngreen cloud instances. Besides, it offsets the carbon emitted by traditional\nbackend email services. With GreenMail, users could set a carbon emission\nconstraint and use traditional email service without breaking any code\nmodification of user side and email server side.\n",

The idea is to define a set of fuzzy\nrules obtained from observers or expert knowledge and to specify a fuzzy model\nwhich computes this duration, this latter is fed into the simulator to specify\nthe new value in the model. In conventional model, each state is defined by a\nmean lifetime value whereas our method, calculates for each state the new\nlifetime according to inputs values. A wildfire case study is presented at the\nend of the paper. It is a challenging task due to its complex behavior,\ndynamical weather condition, and various variables involved. A global\nspecification of the fuzzy controller and the forest fire model are presented\nin the DEVS formalism and comparison between conventional and fuzzy method is\nillustrated.\n",

Recent machines for semiconductor process\nare required for high level of automation which are composed of motion control,\nmachine vision, data acquisition and networking. These functions are executed\nthrough industrial equipments that are generally installed in a computer. The\nequipments occupy a great part of system resource and generate a lot of\ncomputation, so the software structure should be designed for efficiency. The\nproposed architecture is consisted of four layers and virtual equipments(VEs).\nThe VEs are made by subclassing the physical equipments(PEs) and the layers are\ncoded into thread which updates the status of VEs. Subroutines in a program\nrefer to the pointer of VEs, and direct access to physical equipment are\nprohibited. The number of access (NOA) to PEs in typical industrial application\nwas simulated for the unlimited access structure and the presented structure.\nThe result showed that the proposed structure was more efficient than typical\nones and irrespective of subroutines. This architecture was also applied to\ndesign a machine operating software and performed automatic wafer dicing.\n",

However, if we go for a walk\nand have a look at the old part of any city, we will realize that still most of\nthe buildings have a wood structure. In spite of the fact that the majority of\nurban regulations forbid their demolition, other bad practices such as casting\nand overloading the wood structure are very common. Considering that we want to\nreach a standard of sustainable construction, the economical and environmental\ncosts, which are implied by the deficient refurbishment makes it well worth a\nprevious study of the structure, which in most cases represents less than a 1%\nof the total budget. The main goal of this paper is to present most relevant\nparts of the whole process of diagnosis of a wood structure building by means\nof Non-Destructive Testing Techniques. Among the ones to be considered, we\ncould mention the analysis of the building and its surroundings, on-site\ninspection of the building, structural diagnosis, definition of the corrective\nactions to be taken, definition of treatments, quality control and a\nmaintenance plan. For the on-site inspection of the building, in the paper we\nwill highlight the use of Non-Destructive methods such as resistograph\ndrilling, X-ray imaging, ultrasound-based testing or moisture measurement. We\nwill provide practical examples of all this. The aim of this paper is to give\nthe audience an overall idea on how a pre-assessment work can enhance the\nrefurbishment of a wood structure building while reducing costs and\nenvironmental impact.\n",

Coal blending represents a challenging and complex\nproblem with numerous blending possibilities, multiple constraints and\ncompeting objectives. At many mine sites, blending decisions are made using\nheuristics that have been developed through experience or made by using\ncomputer assisted control algorithms or linear programming. While current\nblending procedures have achieved profitable outcomes in the past, they often\nresult in a sub-optimal utilization of high quality coal. This sub-optimality\nhas a considerable negative impact on mine site productivity as it can reduce\nthe amount of lower quality ROM that is blended and sold. This article reviews\nthe coal blending problem and discusses some of the difficult trade-offs and\nchallenges that arise in trying to address this problem. We highlight some of\nthe risks from making simplifying assumptions and the limitations of current\nsoftware optimization systems. We conclude by explaining how the mining\nindustry would significantly benefit from research and development into\noptimization algorithms and technologies that are better able to combine\ncomputer optimization algorithm capabilities with the important insights of\nengineers and quality control specialists.\n",

In recent years, new types of storage systems such\nas solid state disks (SSD) have been introduced. Unlike hard disks that have\nmechanical structure, SSDs are based on flash memory and thus have electronic\nstructure. Generally a SSD consists of a number of flash memory chips, some\nbuffers of the volatile memory type, and an embedded microprocessor, which have\nbeen interconnected by a port. This microprocessor run a small file system\nwhich called flash translation layer (FTL). This software controls and\nschedules buffers, data transfers and all flash memory tasks. SSDs have some\nadvantages over hard disks such as high speed, low energy consumption, lower\nheat and noise, resistance against damage, and smaller size. Besides, some\ndisadvantages such as limited endurance and high price are still challenging.\nIn this study, the effort is to combine two common technologies - SLC and MLC\nchips - used in the manufacture of SSDs in a single SSD to decrease the side\neffects of current SSDs.

Since the power consumption and reliability of\nmicroprocessors are highly dependent on temperature, management units need\naccurate thermal models. Exponential cooling models are justified for\nactively-cooled systems. Here, we analyze the tractability of the cooling law\nfor a passively cooled body, subject to radiative and convective cooling,\nincluding internal heat generation. Focusing then on embedded system-like\nobjects, we compare the performance difference between our new passive cooling\nlaw and the conventionally-used exponential one. We show that, for quasi\nisothermal cooling surfaces of the order of 1\\,dm$^2$ or greater, the radiative\ncooling effect may become comparable to the convective cooling one. In other\nwords, radiation becomes non-negligible for systems with a cooling surface\nlarger than about 1\\,dm$^2$. Otherwise for surfaces below 1\\,dm$^2$, we show\nthat the differences between the exact solution and the exponential cooling law\nbecomes negligible.

Some\nPV systems are affected by complex shading scenes whose resulting PV energy\nlosses are very difficult to evaluate with current modeling tools. Several\nspecialized PV design and simulation software include the possibility to\nevaluate shading losses. They generally possess a Graphical User Interface\n(GUI) through which the user can draw a 3D shading scene, and then evaluate its\ncorresponding PV energy losses. The complexity of the objects that these tools\ncan handle is relatively limited. We have created a software solution, 3DPV,\nwhich allows evaluating the energy losses induced by complex 3D scenes on PV\ngenerators. The 3D objects can be imported from specialized 3D modeling\nsoftware or from a 3D object library. The shadows cast by this 3D scene on the\nPV generator are then directly evaluated from the Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU). Thanks to the recent development of GPUs for the video game industry,\nthe shadows can be evaluated with a very high spatial resolution that reaches\nwell beyond the PV cell level, in very short calculation times. A PV simulation\nmodel then translates the geometrical shading into PV energy output losses.\n3DPV has been implemented using WebGL, which allows it to run directly from a\nWeb browser, without requiring any local installation from the user. This also\nallows taken full benefits from the information already available from\nInternet, such as the 3D object libraries. This contribution describes, step by\nstep, the method that allows 3DPV to evaluate the PV energy losses caused by\ncomplex shading. We then illustrate the results of this methodology to several\napplication cases that are encountered in the world of PV systems design.\n",

Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were\nintroduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation\nmetric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even\nwith the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to\nincomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is\nevaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by\nthe considered appliances, the number of used appliances, the device type\nrepresenting the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the\nconsumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of\naggregated consumption data providing an assessment of the problem complexity\naffected by the used appliances, the appliance characteristics and the\nappliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on\ndifferent real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach.

Since senior citizens are\nat high risk of non communicable diseases requiring long-term care, this trend\nwill challenge the sustainability of the entire health system. Pervasive\ncomputing can provide innovative methods and tools for early detecting the\nonset of health issues. In this paper we propose a novel method to detect\nabnormal behaviors of elderly people living at home. The method relies on\nmedical models, provided by cognitive neuroscience researchers, describing\nabnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of\nmild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires\nlow-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and\nfurniture, as well as data from environmental sensors. Based on those data, a\nnovel hybrid statistical-symbolical technique is used to detect the abnormal\nbehaviors of the patient, which are communicated to the medical center.\nDifferently from related works, our method can detect abnormal behaviors at a\nfine-grained level, thus providing an important tool to support the medical\ndiagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the\nsystem and acquired a large dataset of abnormal behaviors carried out in an\ninstrumented smart home.

However,\nits efficient design and practical implementation has not yet been achieved on\nmote platforms that are typical in wireless sensor network due to resource\nconstrains. In this paper, we propose SparseS-XCorr: cross-correlation via\nstructured sparse representation, a new computing framework for ranging based\non L1-minimization and structured sparsity. The key idea is to compress the\nranging signal samples on the mote by efficient random projections and transfer\nthem to a central device; where a convex optimization process estimates the\nrange by exploiting the sparse signal structure in the proposed correlation\ndictionary. Through theoretical validation, extensive empirical studies and\nexperiments on an end-to-end acoustic ranging system implemented on resource\nlimited off-the-shelf sensor nodes, we show that the proposed framework can\nachieve up to two orders of magnitude better performance compared to other\napproaches such as working on DCT domain and downsampling. Compared to the\nstandard cross-correlation, it is able to obtain range estimates with a bias of\n2-6cm with 30% and approximately 100cm with 5% compressed measurements. Its\nstructured sparsity model is able to improve the ranging accuracy by 40% under\nchallenging recovery conditions (such as high compression factor and low\nsignal-to-noise ratio) by overcoming limitations due to dictionary coherence.\n",

From this result, the manuscript provides an alternative\napproach to such issue from a more general point of view. It is oriented to\nclarify the issue from the didactic viewpoint, rather than provide a more\nefficient general technique for circuit analysis. By starting from a linear\nsystem of equations, representing a general linear circuit containing\ncontrolled sources, the correct interpretation of turning off the controlled\nelements in terms of circuit equivalent is provided, so allowing a statement of\nthe POS for linear circuits in a wider context.

Power optimization\nis one of the major design goals that is witnessing such new challenges. The\npresence of interaction between the cyber and physical components of a CPS\nleads to dependence between the time delay of a computational task and the\namount of workload in the next iteration.

We\npropose a simple power management policy, and show that this policy achieves a\nbest possible notion of optimality. In fact, we show that the optimal power\nconsumption is attained in a \"steady-state\" operation and a simple policy of\nfinding and entering this steady state suffices, which can be quite surprising\nconsidering the added complexity of this problem.

Since modern embedded applications become\nmore complex with dynamic behavior changes at run-time, several extensions of\nthe SDF model have been proposed to specify the dynamic behavior changes while\npreserving static analyzability of the SDF model. They assume that an\napplication has a finite number of behaviors (or modes) and each behavior\n(mode) is represented by an SDF graph. They are classified as multi-mode\ndataflow models in this paper. While there exist several scheduling techniques\nfor multi-mode dataflow models, no one allows task migration between modes. By\nobserving that the resource requirement can be additionally reduced if task\nmigration is allowed, we propose a multiprocessor scheduling technique of a\nmulti-mode dataflow graph considering task migration between modes. Based on a\ngenetic algorithm, the proposed technique schedules all SDF graphs in all modes\nsimultaneously to minimize the resource requirement. To satisfy the throughput\nconstraint, the proposed technique calculates the actual throughput requirement\nof each mode and the output buffer size for tolerating throughput jitter. We\ncompare the proposed technique with a method which analyzes SDF graphs in each\nexecution mode separately and a method that does not allow task migration for\nsynthetic examples and three real applications: H.264 decoder, vocoder, and LTE\nreceiver algorithms.\n",

For instance, in testing refrigeration compressors, we want to\nfind the true refrigeration capacity of the compressor being tested. Such test\n(also called an episode) may take up to four hours, being an actual hindrance\nto applying it to the total number of compressors produced. This work seeks to\nreduce the time spent on such industrial trials by employing Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs) as dynamical models for detecting when a test is entering the\nso-called steady-state region. Specifically, we use Reservoir Computing (RC)\nnetworks which simplify the learning of RNNs by speeding up training time and\nshowing convergence to a global optimum. Also, this work proposes a\nself-organized subspace projection method for RC networks which uses\ninformation from the beginning of the episode to define a cluster to which the\nepisode belongs to. This assigned cluster defines a particular binary input\nthat shifts the operating point of the reservoir to a subspace of trajectories\nfor the duration of the episode. This new method is shown to turn the RC model\nrobust in performance with respect to varying combination of reservoir\nparameters, such as spectral radius and leak rate, when compared to a standard\nRC network.\n",

        "summary": "  Computer science marches towards energy-aware practices. This trend impacts\nnot only the design of computer architectures, but also the design of programs.\nHowever, developers still lack affordable and accurate technology to measure\nenergy consumption in computing systems. The goal of this paper is to mitigate\nsuch problem. To this end, we introduce JetsonLEAP, a framework that supports\nthe implementation of energy-aware programs. JetsonLEAP consists of an embedded\nhardware, in our case, the Nvidia Tegra TK1 System-on-a-chip device, a circuit\nto control the flow of energy, of our own design, plus a library to instrument\nprogram parts. We discuss two different circuit setups. The most precise setup\nlets us reliably measure the energy spent by 225,000 instructions, the least\nprecise, although more affordable setup, gives us a window of 975,000\ninstructions. To probe the precision of our system, we use it in tandem with a\nhigh-precision, high-cost acquisition system, and show that results do not\ndiffer in any significant way from those that we get using our simpler\napparatus. Our entire infrastructure - board, power meter and both circuits -\ncan be reproduced with about $500.00. To demonstrate the efficacy of our\nframework, we have used it to measure the energy consumed by programs running\non ARM cores, on the GPU, and on a remote server. Furthermore, we have studied\nthe impact of OpenACC directives on the energy efficiency of high-performance\napplications.\n",

However, one major drawback\nof conventional DFM rule scoring methodologies is that resultant DFM rule\nscores may not accurate since the scores may not highly correspond to\nlithography simulation results. For instance, conventional DFM rule scoring\nmethodologies usually use rule-based techniques to compute scores without\nconsidering neighboring geometric scenarios of targeted layout shapes. That can\nlead to inaccurate scoring results since computed DFM rule scores can be either\ntoo optimistic or too pessimistic. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\napproach with the use of machine learning technology to analyze the context of\ntargeted layouts and predict their lithography impacts on manufacturability.\n",

A demanding solution to this problem is redundant via\ninsertion during post-routing optimization. It becomes very critical when a\nmulti-layer routing solution already incurs a large number of vias. Very few\nglobal routers addressed unconstrained via minimization (UVM) problem, while\nusing minimal pattern routing and layer assignment of nets. It also includes a\nrecent floorplan based early global routability assessment tool STAIRoute\n\\cite{karb2}.\n  This work addresses an early version of unconstrained via minimization\nproblem during early global routing by identifying a set of minimal bend\nrouting regions in any floorplan, by a new recursive bipartitioning framework.\nThese regions facilitate monotone pattern routing of a set of nets in the\nfloorplan by STAIRoute. The area/number balanced floorplan bipartitionining is\na multi-objective optimization problem and known to be NP-hard \\cite{majum2}.\nNo existing approaches considered bend minimization as an objective and some of\nthem incurred higher runtime overhead. In this paper, we present a Greedy as\nwell as randomized neighbor search based staircase wave-front propagation\nmethods for obtaining optimal bipartitioning results for minimal bend routing\nthrough multiple routing layers, for a balanced trade-off between routability,\nwirelength and congestion.\n  Experiments were conducted on MCNC/GSRC floorplanning benchmarks for studying\nthe variation of early via count obtained by STAIRoute for different values of\nthe trade-off parameters ($\\gamma, \\beta$) in this multi-objective optimization\nproblem, using $8$ metal layers. We studied the impact of ($\\gamma, \\beta$)\nvalues on each of the objectives as well as their linear combination function\n$Gain$ of these objectives.\n",

The overall application environment is a continuously growing\nand interconnected cyber-physical system so that analytical assessment is\npractically impossible to realize. Consequently, new solutions must be\nevaluated in simulation studies. Due to the interdisciplinarity of the\nsimulation scenarios, various heterogeneous tools must be connected. This\napproach is known as co-simulation. During the last years, different approaches\nhave been developed or adapted for applications in energy systems. In this\npaper, two co-simulation approaches are compared that follow generic, versatile\nconcepts. The tool mosaik, which has been explicitly developed for the purpose\nof co-simulation in complex energy systems, is compared to the High Level\nArchitecture (HLA), which possesses a domain-independent scope but is often\nemployed in the energy domain. The comparison is twofold, considering the\ntools' conceptual architectures as well as results from the simulation of\nrepresentative test cases. It suggests that mosaik may be the better choice for\nentry-level, prototypical co-simulation while HLA is more suited for complex\nand extensive studies.\n",

We build a real-time cloud-based system\nthat can receive heterogeneous IoT data, allow users to create a\nthree-dimensional model online according to the real world structure, and the\nmonitoring results can be visualized in that model. In this paper, we\nillustrate the software architecture of the proposed system and focus on the\ntechnologies that are used, like client-side scripting, NoSql database, and\nsocket communication. We also present the challenges of displaying the overall\nmovement and shape transformation of the 3D structural model. Thus, each\ninternal-connected element's rotations and translations are obtained by\nconverting the monitoring results of each sensor device measured in the global\ncoordinate system. To overcome this, we create an inverted movement calculation\nmethod. A simple 3D two-level structural model and simulated sensor\ndisplacements are used to demonstrate system function and validate the inverted\nmovement calculation method.\n",

This problem is known\nas community detection, and has become very important in various fields of\nscience including chemistry, biology and social sciences. The problem of\ncommunity detection is a twofold problem that consists of determining the\nnumber of communities and, at the same time, finding those communities. This\ndrastically increases the solution space for heuristics to work on, compared to\ntraditional graph partitioning problems. In many of the scientific domains in\nwhich graphs are used, there is the need to have the ability to partition a\ngraph into communities with the ``highest quality'' possible since the presence\nof even small isolated communities can become crucial to explain a particular\nphenomenon. We have explored community detection using the power of quantum\nannealers, and in particular the D-Wave 2X and 2000Q machines. It turns out\nthat the problem of detecting at most two communities naturally fits into the\narchitecture of a quantum annealer with almost no need of reformulation. This\npaper addresses a systematic study of detecting two or more communities in a\nnetwork using a quantum annealer.\n",

To our knowledge, none of these models have\ngeneralized well to predict future demand at an abstracted level for a new\ndesign/style of fashion article. To address this problem, we present a study of\nlarge scale fashion sales data and directly infer which clothing/footwear\nattributes and merchandising factors drove demand for those items.

        "summary": "  Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of\nbusiness process models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can\nvary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modeling paradigm, the\nfocus of the language, and so on. To make explicit the different constructs and\nrules employed by a specific language as well as bridge the gap across\ndifferent languages, meta-models have been proposed in literature. These\nmeta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art\nliterature considers relevant to describe business processes. Moreover, the\nrapid growth of techniques and tools that aim at supporting all dimensions of\nbusiness processes and not only its control flow perspective, as for instance\ndata and organisational aspects, makes even more important to have a clear\nidea, already at the conceptual level, of the key process constructs. The goal\nof this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review\n(SLR) of business process meta-models. This SLR aims at answering research\nquestions concerning: (i) the kind of meta-models proposed in literature; (ii)\nthe recurring constructs they contain; (iii) their purposes; and (iv) their\nevaluations. Thirty-six papers were selected and evaluated against four\nresearch questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of\nwork conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular,\nwhile traditional paradigms towards business process modelling, and aspects\nrelated to the business process control flow seem to be well present, novel\nparadigms and aspects related to the organisational, data and goal-oriented\naspects of business processes seem to be still under-investigated.\n",

Process mining receives so-called process logs which\nare collections of partially-ordered events. An event has to possess at least\nthree attributes, case ID, task ID and a timestamp for mining approaches to\nwork. When a case ID is unknown, the event is called unlabeled. Traditionally,\nprocess mining is an offline task, where events are collected from different\nsources are usually manually correlated. That is, events belonging to the same\ninstance are assigned the same case ID. With today's high-volume/high-speed\nnature of, e.g., IoT applications, process mining shifts to be an online task.\nFor this, event correlation has to be automated and has to occur as the data is\ngenerated. In this paper, we introduce an approach that correlates unlabeled\nevents at runtime. Given a process model, a stream of unlabeled events and\nother information about task duration, our approach can induce a case\nidentifier to a set of unlabeled events with a trust percentage. It can also\ncheck the conformance of the identified cases with the process model. A\nprototype of the proposed approach was implemented and evaluated against\nreal-life and synthetic logs.\n",

        "summary": "  Studies have suggested that there is farming potential in residential\nbuildings. However, these studies are limited in scope, require field visits\nand time-consuming measurements. Furthermore, they have not suggested ways to\nidentify suitable sites on a larger scale let alone means of surveying numerous\nmicro-locations across the same building. Using a case study area focused on\nhigh-rise buildings in Singapore, this paper examines a novel application of 3D\ncity models to identify suitable farming micro-locations in buildings. We\nspecifically investigate whether the vertical spaces of these buildings\ncomprising outdoor corridors, fa\\c{c}ades and windows receive sufficient\nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for growing food crops and do so at a\nhigh resolution. We also analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of PAR,\nand the impact of shadows and different weather conditions on PAR in the\nbuilding. Environmental simulations on the 3D model of the study area indicated\nthat the cumulative daily PAR or Daily Light Integral (DLI) at a location in\nthe building was dependent on its orientation and shape, sun's diurnal and\nannual motion, weather conditions, and shadowing effects of the building's\nfa\\c{c}ades and surrounding buildings. The DLI in the study area generally\nincreased with building's levels and, depending on the particular\nmicro-location, was found suitable for growing moderately light-demanding crops\nsuch as lettuce and sweet pepper. These variations in DLI at different\nlocations of the same building affirmed the need for such simulations. The\nsimulations were validated with field measurements of PAR, and correlation\ncoefficients between them exceeded 0.5 in most cases thus, making a case that\n3D city models offer a promising practical solution to identifying suitable\nfarming locations in residential buildings, and have the potential for\nurban-scale applications.\n",

        "summary": "  Even though the traffic systems in developed countries have been analyzed\nwith rigor and operated efficiently, the same does not generally hold for\ndeveloping countries due to inadequate planning, design, and operations of\ntheir transportation systems. Because of inherent differences between internal\ninfrastructures, the systems deployed in developed countries may not be\namenable to developing ones. Besides, the traffic systems of developing\ncountries are not well-studied in the literature to the best of our knowledge.\nFor example, it is yet to explore how a developed country's lane-based traffic\nflow would perform in the context of a developing country, which generally\nexperiences non-lane-based traffic. As such, by using our newly developed\ntraffic simulator 'RoadBird', we investigate outcomes of both lane-based and\nnon-lane-based traffic from the contexts of both developing and developed\ncountries. To do so, we run simulations over real road topologies (extracted\nfrom the GIS maps of major cities such as Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh) considering\ndifferent scenarios such as lane-based or non-lane-based flows, homogeneous or\nheterogeneous traffic, with or without pedestrians, etc. We also incorporate\ndifferent car-following and lane-changing models to mimic traffic behaviors and\ninvestigate their performances. While the lane changing dilemma remains an open\nresearch question, our experimental evidences indicate: (i) lane-based\napproaches will not necessarily perform better in the case of currently-adopted\nnon-lane-based scenarios; and (ii) non-lane-based strategies may benefit system\nperformance in lane-based scenarios while having heavy mixed traffic.\nNonetheless, we reveal several new insights for on-road experiences both in\ndeveloping and developed countries.\n",

Although previous studies proposed a variety of trip end\nidentification methods from different perspectives, these studies subjectively\ndefined key threshold parameters and ignored the complex intracity heavy truck\ntravel characteristics.

The\nvalidation results show that the accuracy of the method we propose is 87.45%.\nOur method incorporates the impact of the city freight context on truck\ntrajectory characteristics, and its results can reflect the spatial\ndistribution and chain patterns of intracity heavy truck freight trips, which\nhave a wide range of practical applications.\n",

A\npost-project evaluation is an evaluation of a project's actions and outcomes\nafter its completion. Post-project evaluation can scientifically and\nobjectively evaluate the construction effectiveness of video surveillance\nsystem at a certain stage. Utilizing post-project evaluation can find out the\ncauses of success or failure to make recommendations for the construction of a\nsecurity video surveillance system in the next stage. Therefore, we propose a\nfuzzy post-project evaluation approach for the security video surveillance\nsystem in a real-world community. The fuzzy theory and fuzzy multi-level\nevaluation method are applied. The evaluation result demonstrates that the\nproposed approach is practically applicable to real-world security video\nsurveillance systems.\n",

Today, almost every process activity generates data;\nthese data do not play the role in process mining that it deserves. This paper\nintroduces a visualization technique for enhancing discovered process models\nwith domain data, thereby allowing data-based exploration of processes.\nData-enhanced process models aim at supporting domain experts to explore the\nprocess, where they can select attributes of interest and observe their\ninfluence on the process.

For the chronic disorder\ntinnitus, only few long-running intervention studies exist, which use mobile\ntechnology in a larger setting. Tinnitus is characterized by its heterogeneous\npatient's symptom profiles, which complicates the development of general\ntreatments. In the UNITI project, researchers from different European countries\ntry to unify existing treatments and interventions to cope with this\nheterogeneity. One study arm (UNITI Mobile) exploits mobile technology to\ninvestigate newly implemented interventions types, especially within the\npan-European setting. The goals are to learn more about the validity and\nusefulness of mobile technology in this context. Furthermore, differences among\nthe countries shall be investigated. Practically, two native intervention apps\nhave been developed for UNITI and the mobile study arm, which pose features not\npresented so far in other apps of the authors. Along the implementation\nprocedure, it is discussed whether these features might leverage similar types\nof studies in future. Since instruments like the mHealth evidence reporting and\nassessment checklist (mERA), developed by the WHO mHealth technical evidence\nreview group, indicate that aspects shown for UNITI Mobile are important in the\ncontext of health interventions using mobile phones, our findings may be of a\nmore general interest and are therefore being discussed in the work at hand.\n",

Thus, this is a fully challenge issue to\noptimize these variables for task offloading to sustainably reduce energy\nconsumption with load balancing while ensuring that a task is completed before\nits deadline. In this paper, we first provide a Mixed Integer Nonlinear\nProgramming Problem (MINLP) formulation for such task offloading under energy\nand deadline constraints in IoV. Furthermore, in order to efficiently solve the\nformulated MINLP, we decompose it into two subproblems, and design a\nlow-complexity Joint Optimization for Energy Consumption and Task Processing\nDelay (JOET) algorithm to optimize selection decisions, resource allocation,\noffloading ratio and transmit power adjustment. We carry out extensive\nsimulation experiments to validate JOET. Simulation results demonstrate that\nJOET outperforms many representative existing approaches in quickly converge\nand effectively reduce energy consumption and delay. Specifically, average\nenergy consumption and task processing delay have been reduced by 15.93% and\n15.78%, respectively, and load balancing efficiency has increased by 10.20%.\n",

One\nimportant area of sport-science research that features small data sets is the\nstudy of recovery from exercise. In this area, models are typically fitted to\ndata collected from exhaustive exercise test protocols, which athletes can\nperform only a few times. Recent findings highlight that established recovery\nsuch as the so-called work-balance models are too simple to adequately fit\nobserved trends in the data. Therefore, we investigated a hydraulic model that\nrequires the same few data points as work-balance models to be applied, but\npromises to predict recovery dynamics more accurately.\n  To compare the hydraulic model to established work-balance models, we\nretrospectively applied them to data compiled from published studies. In total,\none hydraulic model and three work-balance models were compared on data\nextracted from five studies. The hydraulic model outperformed established\nwork-balance models on all defined metrics, even those that penalize models\nfeaturing higher numbers of parameters.

Existing structural analysis methods need\nflattening of the hierarchical models into an equation system for analysis.\nHowever, the large-scale equations in complex models make structural analysis\ndifficult. Aimed to address the issue, this study proposes a hierarchical\nstructural analysis method by exploring the relationship between the\nsingularities of the hierarchical equation-oriented model and its components.\nThis method obtains the singularity of a hierarchical equation-oriented model\nby analyzing a dummy model constructed with the parts from the decomposing\nresults of its components. Based on this, the structural singularity of a\ncomplex model can be obtained by layer-by-layer analysis according to their\nnatural hierarchy. The hierarchical structural analysis method can reduce the\nequation scale in each analysis and achieve efficient structural analysis of\nvery complex models. This method can be adaptively applied to\nnonlinear-algebraic and differential-algebraic equation models. The main\nalgorithms, application cases and comparison with the existing methods are\npresent in this paper. The complexity analysis results show the enhanced\nefficiency of the proposed method in the structural analysis of complex\nequation-oriented models.

The application of building metadata simplifies the creation of digital\nrepresentations and provides portable data analytics. Typical metadata\nstandards such as Brick and Haystack are used to describe the data of the\nbuilding system. Brick uses standard ontologies to create building metadata.\nHowever, neither Haystack nor Brick has provided definitions about the Variable\nRefrigerant Flow (VRF) system so far. For years, both Brick and Haystack\nworking groups have been discussing how to describe VRF in their schema, mainly\nabout the classification of VRF and the definitions of VRF units. There were no\nsettled solutions for these problems. Meanwhile, the global VRF market is\ngrowing increasingly fast because of the energy efficiency and installation\nsimplicity of the VRF system. It is needed to have the metadata to describe VRF\nunits in buildings for data analysis and management. Addressing this challenge,\nthis paper extended Brick Schema with the VRF module and verified the Brick VRF\nmodule. Then, the model and the service framework were developed and applied\nfor a building in China. The framework can serve portable energy analysis for\ndifferent areas.

Our IG framework transforms a trajectory with discrete-time\nmeasurements to a canonical representation, i.e., continuous in time with\ncontinuous mean and variance estimates, and then quantifies the reduction of\nuncertainty about the locations of the owner over a period of time as the VOI\nof the trajectory.

        "summary": "  Digitalization continuously pervades all areas and the Internet of Things\n(IoT) is still on the rise. This leads to an increased need for efficiency in\nthe development of embedded devices and systems composed thereof. Hybrid\ntestbeds are common environments to representatively assess, e.g.,\nhardware-software interaction, interoperability, and scalability. Although\nautomation is inevitable to achieve efficiency, not all devices offer\ninterfaces to be fully software-controlled. Most notably, block devices tend to\nbe inaccessible for software outside a Device under Test (DuT), especially when\nthe latter is in a dysfunctional state.\n  This paper introduces the Networked SD card (NetSD) which enables remote\naccess to removable block devices. The proposed system consists of a hardware\npart, which enables multiplexed access to a block device (e.g., an SD card) and\na software part which enables remote access to the block device (e.g., via HTTP\nor network block device). NetSD thus adds testing and automation possibilities\nto DuTs without the need to modify their hard- or software. During the hardware\ndesign, we fund that different SD transfer modes and access profiles (read or\nwrite focus) benefit from different pull-up resistor configurations for the\ndata lines.\n",

Process mining techniques capture the state of\nrunning processes w.r.t. various aspects, such as activity-flow and performance\nmetrics. The next step for process owners is to take the provided insights and\nturn them into actions in order to improve their processes. These actions may\nbe taken in different aspects of a process. However, simply being aware of the\nprocess aspects that need to be improved as well as potential actions is\ninsufficient. The key step in between is to assess the outcomes of the\ndecisions and improvements. In this paper, we propose a framework to\nsystematically compare event data and the simulated event data of\norganizations, as well as comparing the results of modified processes in\ndifferent settings. The proposed framework could be provided as an analytic\nservice to enable organizations in easily accessing event data analytics. The\nframework is supported with a simulation tool that enables applying changes to\nthe processes and re-running the process in various scenarios. The simulation\nstep includes different perspectives of a process that can be captured\nautomatically and modified by the user. Then, we apply a state-of-the-art\ncomparison approach for processes using their event data which visually\nreflects the effects of these changes in the process, i.e., evaluating the\nprocess improvement.

For several reasons including variations in satellite\nposition, environmental factors, and design decisions made by the manufacturer,\nGPS-enabled watches can produce position measurement errors. These can result\nin incorrect estimations of total distance covered as well as running pace.\nThis study examined the accuracy of three Garmin running watches of different\ntechnological generations using repetitive trials, over several years, by the\nsame runner over the same route. The older watches, a Forerunner 205 and a\nForerunner 220, showed similar accuracy when traversing the route. The newer\ngeneration watch, a Forerunner 45S, was found to be significantly less accurate\nin terms of both the trueness and precision of its distance measurements. This\nmay indicate that Garmin, in competition with other manufacturers of similar\ndevices, has chosen in recent years to prioritize device miniaturization and\nbattery life over accuracy.\n",

        "summary": "  The Turing machine halting problem can be explained by several factors,\nincluding arithmetic logic irreversibility and memory erasure, which contribute\nto computational uncertainty due to information loss during computation.\nEssentially, this means that an algorithm can only preserve information about\nan input, rather than generate new information. This uncertainty arises from\ncharacteristics such as arithmetic logical irreversibility, Landauer's\nprinciple, and memory erasure, which ultimately lead to a loss of information\nand an increase in entropy. To measure this uncertainty and loss of\ninformation, the concept of arithmetic logical entropy can be used. The Turing\nmachine and its equivalent, general recursive functions can be understood\nthrough the {\\lambda} calculus and the Turing/Church thesis. However, there are\ncertain recursive functions that cannot be fully understood or predicted by\nother algorithms due to the loss of information during logical-arithmetic\noperations. In other words, the behaviour of these functions cannot be\ncompletely determined at every stage of the computation due to a lack of\ninformation in their definition. While there are some cases where the behaviour\nof recursive functions is highly predictable, the lack of information in most\ncases makes it impossible for algorithms to determine if a program will halt or\nnot. This inability to predict the outcome of the computation is the essence of\nthe halting problem of the Turing machine. Even in cases where more information\nis available about the program, it is still difficult to determine with\ncertainty if the program will halt or not. This also highlights the importance\nof the Turing oracle machine, which introduces information from outside the\ncomputation to compensate for the lack of information and ultimately decide the\nresult of the computation.\n",

Most existing models of football player motion have not been\nvalidated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is\nthat performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of\nplayer motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable\npositions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football\nplayers typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of\nactually reachable positions.\n  This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that\nmeasures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all\npossibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of\nreachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a\nmanually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four\ndifferent motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion\nwith constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed\nlimit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show\nthat assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a\nlimit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate\ndistinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two\nsegments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the\ntested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of\nreal-world player motion.\n",

Some\nfeatures of their experimental protocol make it difficult to apply to other\nsubjects and/or species without introducing a risk for some bias, as subjects\ncould read cues from the experimenter (even though the study's subjects\nprobably did not). Can digital life enrichment techniques permit us to\nreplicate their results with other species with less risk for experimental\nbias, with a better precision, and at lower cost? Inspired by previous informal\ndigital life enrichment experiments with parrots, we designed and tested a web\napplication to digitally replicate and extend Ain et al.'s experimental setup.\nWe were able to obtain similar results to theirs for two individuals from a\ndistinct species, Monk Parakeets (Myiopsitta Monachus), with increased\nguarantees against potential experimental biases, in a way which should allow\nto replicate such experiments at larger scale and at a much lower cost.\n",

Mainstream approaches in\nthis space suffer from various limitations, some stemming from the fact that\nthey treat resources as undifferentiated entities grouped into resource pools.\nThese approaches assume that all resources in a pool have the same performance\nand share the same availability calendars. Previous studies have acknowledged\nthese assumptions, without quantifying their impact on simulation model\naccuracy. This paper addresses this gap in the context of simulation models\nautomatically discovered from event logs. The paper proposes a simulation\napproach and a method for discovering simulation models, wherein each resource\nis treated as an individual entity, with its own performance and availability\ncalendar. An evaluation shows that simulation models with differentiated\nresources more closely replicate the distributions of cycle times and the work\nrhythm in a process than models with undifferentiated resources.\n",

        "summary": "  Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a common technique to estimate the\nimpact of business process changes, e.g. what would be the cycle time of a\nprocess if the number of traces increases? The starting point of BPS is a\nbusiness process model annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model).\nSeveral studies have proposed methods to automatically discover BPS models from\nevent logs -- extracted from enterprise information systems -- via process\nmining techniques. These approaches model the processing time of each activity\nbased on the start and end timestamps recorded in the event log. In practice,\nhowever, it is common that the recorded start times do not precisely reflect\nthe actual start of the activities. For example, a resource starts working on\nan activity, but its start time is not recorded until she/he interacts with the\nsystem. If not corrected, these situations induce waiting times in which the\nresource is considered to be free, while she/he is actually working. To address\nthis limitation, this article proposes a technique to identify the waiting time\nprevious to each activity instance in which the resource is actually working on\nthem, and repair their start time so that they reflect the actual processing\ntime. The idea of the proposed technique is that, as far as simulation is\nconcerned, an activity instance may start once it is enabled and the\ncorresponding resource is available. Accordingly, for each activity instance,\nthe proposed technique estimates the activity enablement and the resource\navailability time based on the information available in the event log, and\nrepairs the start time to include the non-recorded processing time. An\nempirical evaluation involving eight real-life event logs shows that the\nproposed approach leads to BPS models that closely reflect the temporal\ndynamics of the process.\n",

People\nsuffering from various diseases are dealing with various sleeping disorders,\ncommonly known as sleep apnea. Real-time monitoring of sleep is the key to\ndetecting sleep apnea. To solve this problem, an IoT based real-time sleep\napnea monitoring system has been developed.

The system contains various sensors to measure the\nECG, Heart Rate, Pulse rate, Skin response, and SpO2 of any person during the\nentire sleeping period. To analyze and detect sleep apnea in real time, the\nsystem monitors several people during the sleeping period. The results are\ndisplayed on the monitor of the Arduino boards and in the mobile application.\nThe analysis of the achieved data can detect sleep apnea in some of the people\nthat the system monitored, and it can also display the reason why sleep apnea\nhappens.

        "summary": "  In carpooling systems, a set of drivers owning a private car can accept a\nsmall detour to pick-up and drop-off other riders. However, carpooling is\nwidely used for long-distance trips, where rider-driver matching can be done\ndays ahead. Making carpooling a viable option for daily commute is more\nchallenging, as trips are shorter and, proportionally, the detours tolerated by\ndrivers are more tight. As a consequence, finding riders and drivers sharing\nclose-enough origins, destinations and departure time is less likely, which\nlimits potential matching. In this paper we propose an Integrated System, where\ncarpooling matching is synchronized with Public Transit (PT) schedules, so as\nto serve as a feeder service to PT in the first mile. Driver detours are\nproposed towards PT selected stations, which are used as consolidation points,\nthus increasing matching probability. We present a computationally efficient\nmethod to represent PT schedules and drivers trajectory in a single General\nTransit Feed Specification database, which allows to compute multimodal rider\njourneys using any off the shelf planners. We showcase our approach in the\nmetropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, considering 8k randomly generated trips.\nWe show the benefits of our Integrated System. We find that 10% more riders\nfind a feasible matching with respect to the status quo, where carpooling and\nPT are operated separately. We release our code as open source.\n",

        "summary": "  In order to facilitate the analysis of timing relations between individual\ntransitions in a signal trace, dynamic digital timing analysis offers a less\naccurate but much faster alternative to analog simulations of digital circuits.\nThis primarily requires gate delay models that also account for the fact that\nthe input-to-output delay of a particular input transition also depends on the\ntemporal distance to the previous output transitions. In the case of\nmulti-input gates, the delay also experiences variations caused by multi-input\nswitching (MIS) effects, i.e., transitions at different inputs that occur in\nclose temporal proximity. In this paper, we advocate the development of hybrid\ndelay models for CMOS gates obtained by replacing transistors with time-variant\nresistors. We exemplify our approach by applying it to a NOR gate (and, hence,\nto the dual NAND gate) and a Muller C gate. We analytically solve the resulting\nfirst-order differential equations with non-constant-coefficients, and derive\nanalytic expressions for the resulting MIS gate delays. The resulting formulas\nnot only pave the way to a sound model parametrization procedure, but are also\ninstrumental for implementing fast and efficient digital timing simulation. By\ncomparison with analog simulation data, we show that our models faithfully\nrepresent all relevant MIS effects. Using an implementation in the Involution\nTool, we demonstrate that our model surpasses the alternative digital delay\nmodels for NOR gates known to us in terms of accuracy, with comparably short\nrunning times.\n",

        "summary": "  Objective: This paper proposes a framework to support the scientific research\nof standards so that they can be better measured, evaluated, and designed.\nMethods: Beginning with the notion of common models, the framework describes\nthe general standard problem - the seeming impossibility of creating a\nsingular, persistent and definitive standard which is not subject to change\nover time in an open system. Results: The standard problem arises from\nuncertainty driven by variations in operating context, standard quality,\ndifferences in implementation, and drift over time. As a result, fitting work\nusing conformance services is needed to repair these gaps between a standard\nand what is required for real-world use. To guide standards design and repair,\na framework for measuring performance in context is suggested, based on signal\ndetection theory and technomarkers. Based on the type of common model in\noperation, different conformance strategies are identified: (a) Universal\nconformance (all agents access the same standard); (b) Mediated conformance (an\ninteroperability layer supports heterogeneous agents) and (c) Localized\nconformance (autonomous adaptive agents manage their own needs). Conformance\nmethods include incremental design, modular design, adaptors, and creating\ninteractive and adaptive agents. Discussion: Machine learning should have a\nmajor role in adaptive fitting. Research to guide the choice and design of\nconformance services may focus on the stability and homogeneity of shared\ntasks, and whether common models are shared ahead of time or adjusted at task\ntime. Conclusion: This analysis conceptually decouples interoperability and\nstandardization. While standards facilitate interoperability, interoperability\nis achievable without standardization.\n",

Additionally, educational institutions have\nstarted using RFID to track student attendance, combining this technology with\nGoogle Sheets and the Internet of Things (IoT) to build a real-time attendance\ntracking system. For a thorough examination of the creation of a student\nattendance system, this paper includes a systematic literature evaluation of 21\nmajor research published on IoT based attendance systems employing RFID. This\nRFID-based attendance system enables automation, eliminating several problems\nconnected with the manual process, such as time wasting, proxies, and the\npossibility of losing the attendance sheet, in contrast to the traditional\nattendance system, which depends on manual signatures. By creating a system\nthat automatically registers students' attendance by merely flashing their\nstudent cards at the RFID reader, all the aforementioned difficulties may be\nsuccessfully addressed. This automated method guarantees attendance monitoring\naccuracy and dependability while also saving time.

To quickly identify\nmissing tags, traditional protocols adopt Aloha-based strategies which take a\nlong time, especially when the number of tags is large. Among them, few works\nconsidered the effect of unexpected unknown tags on the missing tag\nidentification process. With the presence of unknown tags, some missing tags\nmay be falsely identified as present. Thus, the system's reliability is hardly\nguaranteed. In this work, we propose an efficient early-breaking estimation and\ntree-splitting-based missing tag identification (ETMTI) protocol for\nlarge-scale RFID systems. In ETMTI, a new early-breaking estimation and\ndeactivation method is developed to effectively estimate the number of unknown\ntags and deactivate them within a short time. Next, a new tree-splitting-based\nmissing tag identification method is proposed to quickly identify missing tags\nwith a B-ary splitting tree. Besides, a bit-tracking response strategy is\ndesigned to further reduce the time cost. The optimal parameters, time cost,\nand false negative rate of ETMTI are analyzed theoretically. Simulation results\nare presented to demonstrate that the proposed ETMTI protocol takes a smaller\ntime and has a lower false negative rate than the best-performing benchmarks.\n",

So the dielectric quality of the\ncapacitor becomes important here to determine how effectively it can store some\ncharge. Analog memory is a trade off between hardware cost, chip area and\naccuracy or quality of storage. The circuit of analog memory cell was developed\nstarting from the idea that required voltage will be stored in a capacitor and\nMOS transistors were used as switches. A given technology of integration was\nused and hence the dielectric property of the capacitor was fixed. By suitable\ncircuit configuration the analog voltage value was written to the capacitor,\nread out when required and the charge loss was also refreshed.

In this evolving scenario, the\nmove towards local, on-demand manufacturing is emerging as a remedy to the\nenvironmentally damaging practice of mass-producing products in distant\ncountries and then transporting them over long distances to customers. This\nparadigm shift significantly empowers customers, giving them greater control\nover the manufacturing process by enabling on-demand production and favouring\nlocal production sites over traditional mass production and extensive shipping\npractices. In this position paper we propose a cloud-native Manufacturing as a\nService (MaaS) platform that integrates advances in three-dimensional (3D)\nprinting technology into a responsive and eco-conscious manufacturing\necosystem. In this context, we propose a high-level architectural design for a\ncloud-based MaaS platform that connects web shops of local stores with small\nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating 3D printers. Furthermore, we\noutline an experimental design, including a cost-benefit analysis, to\nempirically evaluate the operational effectiveness and economic feasibility in\na cloud-based additive manufacturing ecosystem. The proposed cloud-based MaaS\nplatform enables on-demand additive manufacturing and opens up a profit sharing\nopportunity between different stakeholders.\n",

Simulated Annealing (SA)\nhas been the method of choice for tackling classical floorplanning problems\nwhere the objective is to minimize wire-length and the total placement area.\nThe goal in industry-relevant floorplanning problems, however, is not only to\nminimize area and wire-length, but to do that while respecting hard placement\nconstraints that specify the general area and/or the specific locations for the\nplacement of some blocks. We show that simply incorporating these constraints\ninto the SA objective function leads to sub-optimal, and often illegal,\nsolutions. We propose the Constraints-Aware Simulated Annealing (CA-SA) method\nand show that it strongly outperforms vanilla SA in floorplanning problems with\nhard placement constraints. We developed a new floorplanning tool on top of\nCA-SA: PARSAC (Parallel Simulated Annealing with Constraints). PARSAC is an\nefficient, easy-to-use, and massively parallel floorplanner. Unlike current\nSA-based or learning-based floorplanning tools that cannot effectively\nincorporate hard placement-constraints, PARSAC can quickly construct the\nPareto-optimal legal solutions front for constrained floorplanning problems.\nPARSAC also outperforms traditional SA on legacy floorplanning benchmarks.\nPARSAC is available as an open-source repository for researchers to replicate\nand build on our result.\n",

This paper analyzes the circulation of data\nwith a philosophical approach, obtains the new explication of data and\nexecuting entity, and provides a new definition of the concepts of data\nutilization and data key stakeholders (objects).

It further discusses the\nthree modes of ``data circulation''. It is pointed out that ``data\ncirculation'' is different from traditional ``commodity circulation''.

To address these challenges, the port logistics\nsector is rapidly adopting advanced technologies such as big data, Internet of\nThings, and AI. However, despite these efforts, solving several issues related\nto productivity, environment, and safety in the port logistics sector requires\ncollaboration among various stakeholders. In this study, we introduce an\nAI-based port logistics metaverse framework (PLMF) that facilitates\ncommunication, data sharing, and decision-making among diverse stakeholders in\nport logistics. The developed PLMF includes 11 AI-based metaverse content\nmodules related to productivity, environment, and safety, enabling the\nmonitoring, simulation, and decision making of real port logistics processes.\nExamples of these modules include the prediction of expected time of arrival,\ndynamic port operation planning, monitoring and prediction of ship fuel\nconsumption and port equipment emissions, and detection and monitoring of\nhazardous ship routes and accidents between workers and port equipment. We\nconducted a case study using historical data from Busan Port to analyze the\neffectiveness of the PLMF. By predicting the expected arrival time of ships\nwithin the PLMF and optimizing port operations accordingly, we observed that\nthe framework could generate additional direct revenue of approximately 7.3\nmillion dollars annually, along with a 79% improvement in ship punctuality,\nresulting in certain environmental benefits for the port.

In the domain of Analog and Mixed-Signal Integrated\nCircuits (AMS ICs), placement automation is lacking behind its digital\ncounterpart, mainly due to the variety of components and complex constraints\nthe placement needs to satisfy. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is a suitable\napproach to modeling the placement problem for AMS ICs.

A\ncritical challenge within TPL is the effective assignment of the layout to\nmasks. Recently, various layout decomposition methods and TPL-aware routing\nmethods have been proposed to consider TPL. However, these methods typically\nresult in numerous conflicts and stitches, and are mainly designed for 2-pin\nnets. This paper proposes a multi-pin net routing method in triple patterning\nlithography, called Mr.TPL. Experimental results demonstrate that Mr.TPL\nreduces color conflicts by 81.17%, decreases stitches by 76.89%, and achieves\nup to 5.4X speed improvement compared to the state-of-the-art TPL-aware routing\nmethod.\n",

        "summary": "  The Virtual Traffic Light (VTL) eliminates the need for physical traffic\nsignal infrastructure at intersections, leveraging Connected Vehicles (CVs) to\noptimize traffic flow. VTL assigns right-of-way dynamically based on factors\nsuch as estimated times of arrival (ETAs), the number of CVs in various lanes,\nand emission rates. These factors are considered in line with the objectives of\nthe VTL application. Aiming to optimize traffic flow and reduce delays, the VTL\nsystem generates Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) data for CVs approaching an\nintersection, while considering the impact of each CV movement on others.\nHowever, the stochastic nature of vehicle arrivals at intersections complicates\nreal-time optimization, challenging classical computing methods. To address\nthis limitation, we develop a VTL method that leverages quantum computing to\nminimize stopped delays for CVs. The method formulates the VTL problem as a\nQuadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, a mathematical\nframework well-suited for quantum computing. Using D-Wave cloud-based quantum\ncomputer, our approach determines optimal solutions for right-of-way\nassignments under the standard National Electrical Manufacturers Association\n(NEMA) phasing system. The system was evaluated using the microscopic traffic\nsimulator SUMO under varying traffic volumes. Our results demonstrate that the\nquantum-enabled VTL system reduces stopped delays and travel times compared to\nclassical optimization-based systems. This approach not only enhances traffic\nmanagement efficiency but also reduces the infrastructure costs associated with\ntraditional traffic signals. The quantum computing-supported VTL system offers\na transformative solution for large-scale traffic control, providing superior\nperformance across diverse traffic scenarios and paving the way for advanced,\ncost-effective traffic management.\n",

We propose a 3D transrectal US based tracking system for\nprecise prostate biopsy sample localisation. The aim is to improve sample\ndistribution, to enable targeting of unsampled regions for repeated biopsies,\nand to make post-interventional quality controls possible. Since the patient is\nnot immobilized, since the prostate is mobile and due to the fact that probe\nmovements are only constrained by the rectum during biopsy acquisition, the\ntracking system must be able to estimate rigid transformations that are beyond\nthe capture range of common image similarity measures. We propose a fast and\nrobust multi-resolution attribute-vector registration approach that combines\nglobal and local optimization methods to solve this problem. Global\noptimization is performed on a probe movement model that reduces the\ndimensionality of the search space and thus renders optimization efficient. The\nmethod was tested on 237 prostate volumes acquired from 14 different patients\nfor 3D to 3D and 3D to orthogonal 2D slices registration. The 3D-3D version of\nthe algorithm converged correctly in 96.7% of all cases in 6.5s with an\naccuracy of 1.41mm (r.m.s.) and 3.84mm (max).

We can develop statistical models based on these common features\nthat can be used to classify proteins, to predict new members, and to study the\nsequence-function relationship of this protein function group. In this study,\nSVM based classification model has been developed for the identification of\nhuman gpcr sequences. Sequences of Level 1 subfamilies of Class A rhodopsin is\nconsidered as case study. In the present study, an attempt has been made to\nclassify GPCRs on the basis of species. The present study classifies human gpcr\nsequences with rest of the species available in GPCRDB. Classification is based\non specific information derived from the n-terminal and extracellular loops of\nthe sequences, some physicochemical properties and amino acid composition of\ncorresponding gpcr sequences. Our method classifies Level 1 subfamilies of\nGPCRs with 94% accuracy.\n",

To fix this deficiency, we modify\nthe amplitudes of the signals of the L and H states and achieve an exponential\nspeedup compared to the old situation. Another improvement concerns the\nidentification of a single product (hyperspace) state. We introduce a time\nshifted noise-based logic, which is constructed by shifting each reference\nsignal with a small time delay. This modification implies an exponential\nspeedup of single hyperspace vector identification compared to the former case\nand it requires the same, O(N) complexity as in quantum computing.\n",

A MOF usually consists of a hexagonal arrangement\nof air holes running down the length of a silica fiber surrounding a central\ncore of solid silica or, in some cases air. MOFs can exhibit a number of unique\nproperties, including zero dispersion at visible wavelengths and low or high\neffective nonlinearity [3]-[17], By varying the size of the holes and their\nnumber and position, one can also design MOFs with carefully controlled\ndispersive and modal properties. In this paper, we analyze and modeling the\nbehavior of the photonic crystal fiber (PCF) by using in the first step a\npropagator method based on the BPM method. With our BPM software, the electric\nfield contour of the fundamental mode of PCF was demonstrated. We also used it\nto see the variation of the effective index; an effective index model confirms\nthat such a fiber can be single mode for any wavelength. It would make a study\nof photonic crystal fibers, and a study of the numerical simulation methods\nallow the simulation of optical properties and has modeled the propagation of\nlight in this fiber type. After that we use the V-parameter because it offers a\nsimple way to design a photonic crystal fiber (PCF), by basing in a recent\nformulation of this parameter of a PCF, we provide numerically based empirical\nexpression for this quantity only dependent on the two structural parameters,\nthe air hole diameter and the hole-to-hole center spacing.\n",

The system uses a technique that is based on a\nfrequency shift in reflected energy to detect a movement or change in position\n(motion). In this system, ultrasonic sound is transmitted from the transmitting\ndevice which is normally in the form of energy. The transmitted sound utilizes\nair as its medium and this travel in a wave type motion. The wave is reflected\nback from the surroundings in the room/hallway and the device hears a pitch\ncharacteristic of the protected environment. In this system, the wave pattern\nis disturbed and reflected back more quickly, thus increasing the pitch and\nsignaling an alarm whenever motion is detected. The main contribution of this\nwork is the design of a circuit that can sense motion through movement of\nanything, a low cost and portable motion detector, and the design of a circuit\nthat can be used to trigger another circuit whether to ON or OFF depending on\nthe circuit attached to it. Generally, the design is made to detect movement or\nmoving object in a an enclosed area. In this work, a transmitter transducer\ngenerates a signal at a frequency of 40khz, and when the signal is blocked by\nany moving object, and this in turn, triggers a buzzer via a timing circuit.\nThis system works on the principle of the signal interference by a moving body,\nand the system is dependent on the presence of an intruder or moving object\nwithin a monitored area. The system after design and construction was tested\nand found to work in accordance with specifications.\n",

Using this platform, we present the first study of\nthe system-level impact of soft errors inside various uncore components of a\nlarge-scale, multi-core SoC using the industrial-grade, open-source OpenSPARC\nT2 SoC design.

To overcome such recovery challenges, we present a new\nreplay recovery technique for uncore components belonging to the memory\nsubsystem. For the L2 cache controller and the DRAM controller components of\nOpenSPARC T2, our new technique reduces the probability that an application run\nfails to produce correct results due to soft errors by more than 100x with\n3.32% and 6.09% chip-level area and power impact, respectively.\n",

The state of the art challenges include AC\nfeasibility and performance, computational complexity, the ability to handle\nlarge-scale real power systems, and dynamic stability. This two-part paper\ninvestigates these challenges by developing an AC TS-based real-time\ncontingency analysis (RTCA) tool that can handle large-scale systems within a\nreasonable time. The tool proposes multiple corrective switching actions, after\ndetection of a contingency with potential violations. To reduce the\ncomputational complexity, three heuristic algorithms are proposed to generate a\nsmall set of candidates for switching. Parallel computing is implemented to\nfurther speed up the solution time. Furthermore, stability analysis is\nperformed to check for dynamic stability of proposed TS solutions. Part I of\nthe paper presents a comprehensive literature review and the methodology. The\npromising results, tested on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) system and\nactual energy management system (EMS) snapshots from Pennsylvania New Jersey\nMaryland (PJM) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), are\npresented in Part II.

On one hand, the\nload demand from EV charging imposes large impact on the stability and\nefficiency of power grid. On the other hand, EVs could potentially act as\nmobile energy storage systems to improve the power network performance, such as\nload flattening, fast frequency control, and facilitating renewable energy\nintegration. Evidently, uncontrolled EV charging could lead to inefficient\npower network operation or even security issues. This spurs enormous research\ninterests in designing charging coordination mechanisms. A key design challenge\nhere lies in the lack of complete knowledge of events that occur in the future.\nIndeed, the amount of knowledge of future events significantly impacts the\ndesign of efficient charging control algorithms. This article focuses on\nintroducing online EV charging scheduling techniques that deal with different\ndegrees of uncertainty and randomness of future knowledge.

        "summary": "  Visual modes of communication are ubiquitous in modern life --- from maps to\ndata plots to political cartoons. Here we investigate drawing, the most basic\nform of visual communication. Participants were paired in an online environment\nto play a drawing-based reference game. On each trial, both participants were\nshown the same four objects, but in different locations. The sketcher's goal\nwas to draw one of these objects so that the viewer could select it from the\narray. On `close' trials, objects belonged to the same basic-level category,\nwhereas on `far' trials objects belonged to different categories. We found that\npeople exploited shared information to efficiently communicate about the target\nobject: on far trials, sketchers achieved high recognition accuracy while\napplying fewer strokes, using less ink, and spending less time on their\ndrawings than on close trials. We hypothesized that humans succeed in this task\nby recruiting two core faculties: visual abstraction, the ability to perceive\nthe correspondence between an object and a drawing of it; and pragmatic\ninference, the ability to judge what information would help a viewer\ndistinguish the target from distractors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we\ndeveloped a computational model of the sketcher that embodied both faculties,\ninstantiated as a deep convolutional neural network nested within a\nprobabilistic program. We found that this model fit human data well and\noutperformed lesioned variants. Together, this work provides the first\nalgorithmically explicit theory of how visual perception and social cognition\njointly support contextual flexibility in visual communication.\n",

Large-scale power system OLND\nis usually manually developed and maintained. The work is tedious,\ntime-consuming and ease to make mistake. Meanwhile, the manually created\ndiagrams are hard to be shared among the on-line and off-line systems. To save\nthe time and efforts to draw and maintain OLNDs, and provide the capability to\nshare the OLNDs, a tool to automatically develop substation based upon Common\nInformation Model (CIM) standard is needed. Currently, there is no standard\nrule to draw the substation OLND. Besides, the substation layouts can be\naltered from the typical formats in textbooks based on factors of economy,\nefficiency, engineering practice, etc. This paper presents a tool on substation\nOLND automatic generation and visualization. This tool takes the substation\nCIM/E model as input, then automatically computes the coordinates of all\ncomponents and generates the substation OLND based on its components attributes\nand connectivity relations. Evaluation of the proposed approach is presented\nusing a real provincial power system. Over 95\\% of substation OLNDs are\ndecently presented and the rest are corner cases, needing extra effort to do\nspecific reconfiguration.\n",

Time\nmultiplexing of reconfigurable hardware resources raises a number of new\nissues, ranging from run-time systems to complex programming models that\nusually form a Reconfigurable hardware Operating System (ROS). The Operating\nSystem performs online task scheduling and handles resource management. There\nare many challenges in adaptive computing and dynamic reconfigurable systems.\nOne of the major understudied challenges is estimating the required resources\nin terms of soft cores, Programmable Reconfigurable Regions (PRRs), the\nappropriate communication infrastructure, and to predict a near optimal layout\nand floorplan of the reconfigurable logic fabric. Some of these issues are\nspecific to the application being designed, while others are more general and\nrelate to the underlying run-time environment. Static resource allocation for\nRun- Time Reconfiguration (RTR) often leads to inferior and unacceptable\nresults. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive and dynamic methodology,\nbased on a Machine Learning approach, for predicting and estimating the\nnecessary resources for an application based on past historical information. An\nimportant feature of the proposed methodology is that the system is able to\nlearn and generalize and, therefore, is expected to improve its accuracy over\ntime.

We propose a coarse-grained cellular\nautomata model that simulates vehicles moving on uniform grids whose size are\nmuch larger compared with the microscopic cellular automata model. The car-car\ninteraction in the microscopic model is replaced by the coupling between\nvehicles and coarse-grained state variables in our model. To parameterize the\nmodel, flux-occupancy relations are fitted from the historical data at every\ngrids, which serve as the coarse-grained fundamental diagrams coupling the\noccupancy and speed. To evaluate the model, we feed it with the historical\ntravel demands and trajectories obtained from the floating car data and use the\nmodel to predict road speed one hour into the future. Numerical results show\nthat our model can capture the traffic flow pattern of the entire city and make\nreasonable predictions.

Streets reconstruction has been seldom\nresearched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a\nunique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing\nthe recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by\nconsidering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for\ncity models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse\nwhich data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street\nreconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features\nreconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects\nreconstruction/modelling.\n  Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role\nthe model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse\nprocedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to\ncome from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of\nthe available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and\nto their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations.

The claim\nby [S{\\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] is that players outperform widely used\nalgorithms, in particular the KASS algorithm, based on the Krotov algorithm,\nand that player intuition is crucial to develop improved methods. However, as\ninitially discussed by D. Sels [D. Sels, Phys. Rev. A 97], a standard\nCoordinate Ascent algorithm outperforms all players by a large margin. Albeit\nD. Sels only compare to player solutions, the simple algorithm outperforms all\nalgorithms based on player solutions and Krotov, and it does so using much less\ntime and iterations. In this paper we elaborate on the methods discussed by D.\nSels and verify that the presented algorithm, solves the problem better than\nall players and algorithms derived from player solutions in [S{\\o}rensen et\nal., Nature 532]. We also verify the theoretical analysis presented by D. Sels,\nthat gives a theoretically derived protocol that outperforms all players. We\nadd a comparison with gradient ascent or GRAPE.

GRAPE works at least\nas well as the methods from [S{\\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] initialized with\nplayer solutions. A standard analysis of the results from GRAPE provides a\nstarting point for GRAPE, that outperform all algorithms from [S{\\o}rensen et\nal., Nature 532].

The\ntraffic characteristic analysis in maintenance work zones is a basis for\nmaintenance work zone related research such as layout design, traffic control\nand safety assessment. Due to the difficulty in vehicle microscopic behaviour\ndata acquisition, traditional traffic characteristic analysis mainly focuses on\nmacroscopic characteristics. With the development of data acquisition\ntechnology, it becomes much easier to obtain a large amount of microscopic\nbehaviour data nowadays, which lays a good foundation for analysing the traffic\ncharacteristics from a new point of view. This paper puts forward a method for\nexpressing and displaying the vehicle behaviour distribution in maintenance\nwork zones. Using portable vehicle microscopic behaviour data acquisition\ndevices, lots of data can be obtained. Based on this data, an endpoint\ndetection technology is used to automatically extract the segments in behaviour\ndata with violent fluctuations, which are segments where vehicles take\nbehaviours such as acceleration or turning. Using the support vector machine\nclassification method, the specific types of behaviours of the segments\nextracted can be identified, and together with a data combination method, a\ntotal of ten types of behaviours can be identified. Then the kernel density\nanalysis is used to cluster different types of behaviours of all passing\nvehicles to show the distribution on maps. By this method, how vehicles travel\nthrough maintenance work zones, and how different vehicle behaviours distribute\nin maintenance work zones can be displayed intuitively on maps, which is a\nnovel traffic characteristic and can shed light to maintenance work zone\nrelated researches such as safety assessment and design method.\n",

Although synchronic emergence of higher levels\nfrom lower levels is manifestly true, diachronic emergence is generically not\nthe case; indeed we give specific examples where it cannot occur because of the\ncausal effectiveness of higher level variables.\n",

Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret\ntheir mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary\naccording to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of\nreal-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable,\nimpeding vehicle-related research. Guided by the 4-part CAN signal definition,\nwe present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, 4-step pipeline for identifying each\nsignal's boundaries (start bit, length), endianness (byte order), signedness\n(bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a\nsubset of the extracted signals with physical interpretation. We provide a\ncomprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. Previous\nmethods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding\nmany standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search\nspace from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing\ndependencies. We formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution\nto an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of\nsignal boundaries and byte orderings. We provide two novel, state-of-the-art\nsignal boundary classifiers-both superior to previous approaches in precision\nand recall in three different test scenarios-and the first signedness\nclassification algorithm which exhibits a $>$97\\% F-score. CAN-D is the only\nsolution with the potential to extract any CAN signal. In evaluation on 10\nvehicles, CAN-D's average $\\ell^1$ error is 5x better than all previous methods\nand exhibits lower ave. error, even when considering only signals that meet\nprior methods' assumptions. CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware,\nallowing for an OBD-II plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding.\n",

However,\nthey may suffer from metastability. Based on the experience that the cascading\nof flip-flop stages yields a dramatic improvement of their overall\nmetastability hardness, in this paper we elaborate on the question whether the\ncascading of Schmitt-Trigger stages can obtain a similar gain. We perform a\ntheoretic analysis that is backed up by an existing metastability model for a\nsingle Schmitt-Trigger stage and elaborate some claims about the behavior of a\nSchmitt-Trigger cascade. These claims suggest that the occurrence of\nmetastability is indeed reduced from the first stage to the second which\nsuggests an improvement. On the downside, however, it becomes clear that\nmetastability can still not be completely ruled out, and in some cases the\nbehavior of the cascade may be less beneficial for a given application, e.g. by\nintroducing seemingly acausal transitions. We validate our findings by\nextensive HSPICE simulations in which we directly cover our most important\nclaims.\n",

Therefore, in the selection or\nconstruction of a suitable Schmitt-Trigger implementation, it is a necessity to\naccurately determine the metastable behavior. Only then one is able to compare\ndifferent designs and thus guide proper optimizations, and only then one can\nassess the potential for residual metastable upsets. However, while the state\nof the art provides a lot of research and practical characterization approaches\nfor flip-flops, comparatively little is known about Schmitt-Trigger\ncharacterization. Unlike the flip-flop with its single metastable point, the\nSchmitt-Trigger exhibits a whole range of metastable points depending on the\ninput voltage. Thus the task of characterization gets much more challenging.\n  In this paper we present different approaches to determine the metastable\nbehavior of Schmitt-Triggers using novel methods and mechanisms. We compare\ntheir accuracy and runtime by applying them to three common circuit\nimplementations. The achieved results are then used to reason about the\nmetastable behavior of the chosen designs which turns out to be problematic in\nsome cases. Overall the approaches proposed in this paper are generic and can\nbe extended beyond the Schmitt-Trigger, i.e., to efficiently characterize\nmetastable states in other circuits as well.\n",

The latter\nsituation presents a significant security risk, and should be avoided. This\narticle suggests that a better way to assess format specification compliance is\nto examine the set of error messages produced by a set of parsers rather than a\nsingle parser. If both a sample of compliant files and a sample of\nnon-compliant files are available, then we show how a statistical test based on\na pseudo-likelihood ratio can be very effective at determining a file's\ncompliance. Our method is format agnostic, and does not directly rely upon a\nformal specification of the format. Although this article focuses upon the case\nof the PDF format (ISO 32000-2), we make no attempt to use any specific details\nof the format. Furthermore, we show how principal components analysis can be\nuseful for a format specification designer to assess the quality and structure\nof these samples of files and parsers. While these tests are absolutely\nrudimentary, it appears that their use to measure file format variability and\nto identify non-compliant files is both novel and surprisingly effective.\n",

We split the entire angular or\nfrequency band into uniform bins. The bin size is set such that the received\nspectra at two frequencies or angles, whose distance is equal to or larger than\nthe size of a bin, are uncorrelated. These problems in the two different\ndomains lead to a similar circulant structure in the so-called coset\ncorrelation matrix. This circulant structure allows for a strong compression\nand a simple least-squares reconstruction method. The latter is possible under\nthe full column rank condition of the system matrix, which can be achieved by\ndesigning the spatial or temporal sampling patterns based on a circular sparse\nruler. We analyze the statistical performance of the compressively\nreconstructed periodogram including bias and variance. We further consider the\ncase when the bins are so small that the received spectra at two frequencies or\nangles, with a spacing between them larger than the size of the bin, can still\nbe correlated. In this case, the resulting coset correlation matrix is\ngenerally not circulant and thus a special approach is required.\n",

        "summary": "  Signal processing on graphs is a recent research domain that aims at\ngeneralizing classical tools in signal processing, in order to analyze signals\nevolving on complex domains. Such domains are represented by graphs, for which\none can compute a particular matrix, called the normalized Laplacian. It was\nshown that the eigenvalues of this Laplacian correspond to the frequencies of\nthe Fourier domain in classical signal processing. Therefore, the frequency\ndomain is not the same for every support graph. A consequence of this is that\nthere is no non-trivial generalization of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,\nthat states that a signal cannot be fully localized both in the time domain and\nin the frequency domain. A way to generalize this principle, introduced by\nAgaskar and Lu, consists in determining a curve that represents a lower bound\non the compromise between precision in the graph domain and precision in the\nspectral domain. The aim of this paper is to propose a characterization of the\nsignals achieving this curve, for a larger class of graphs than the one studied\nby Agaskar and Lu.\n",

        "summary": "  Mobile computing is one of the main drivers of innovation, yet the future\ngrowth of mobile computing capabilities remains critically threatened by\nhardware constraints, such as the already extremely dense transistor packing\nand limited battery capacity. The breakdown of Dennard scaling and stagnating\nenergy storage improvements further amplify these threats. However, the\ncomputational burden we put on our mobile devices is not always justified. In a\nmyriad of situations the result of a computation is further manipulated,\ninterpreted, and finally acted upon. This allows for the computation to be\nrelaxed, so that the result is calculated with \"good enough\", not perfect\naccuracy. For example, results of a Web search may be perfectly acceptable even\nif the order of the last few listed items is shuffled, as an end user decides\nwhich of the available links to follow. Similarly, the quality of a\nvoice-over-IP call may be acceptable, despite being imperfect, as long as the\ntwo involved parties can clearly understand each other. This novel way of\nthinking about computation is termed Approximate Computing (AC) and promises to\nreduce resource usage, while ensuring that satisfactory performance is\ndelivered to end-users. AC is already experimented with on various levels of\ndesktop computer architecture, from the hardware level where incorrect adders\nhave been designed to sacrifice result correctness for reduced energy\nconsumption, to compiler-level optimisations that omit certain lines of code to\nspeed up video encoding. AC is yet to be attempted on mobile devices and in\nthis article we examine the potential benefits of mobile AC and present an\noverview of AC techniques applicable in the mobile domain.\n",

        "summary": "  Typical semiconductor chips include thousands of mostly small memories. As\nmemories contribute an estimated 25% to 40% to the overall power, performance,\nand area (PPA) of a chip, memories must be designed carefully to meet the\nsystem's requirements. Memory arrays are highly uniform and can be described by\napproximately 10 parameters depending mostly on the complexity of the\nperiphery. Thus, to improve PPA utilization, memories are typically generated\nby memory compilers. A key task in the design flow of a chip is to find optimal\nmemory compiler parametrizations which on the one hand fulfill system\nrequirements while on the other hand optimize PPA. Although most compiler\nvendors also provide optimizers for this task, these are often slow or\ninaccurate. To enable efficient optimization in spite of long compiler run\ntimes, we propose training fully connected feed-forward neural networks to\npredict PPA outputs given a memory compiler parametrization. Using an\nexhaustive search-based optimizer framework which obtains neural network\npredictions, PPA-optimal parametrizations are found within seconds after chip\ndesigners have specified their requirements. Average model prediction errors of\nless than 3%, a decision reliability of over 99% and productive usage of the\noptimizer for successful, large volume chip design projects illustrate the\neffectiveness of the approach.\n",

Traditional approaches use cameras, body sensor networks,\nor radio patterns from various sources for activity recognition.

In this paper, we present a novel wearable Radio Frequency\nIdentification (RFID) system aims at providing an easy-to-use solution with\nhigh detection coverage. Our system uses passive tags which are\nmaintenance-free and can be embedded into the clothes to reduce the wearing and\nmaintenance efforts. A small RFID reader is also worn on the user's body to\nextend the detection coverage as the user moves. We exploit RFID radio patterns\nand extract both spatial and temporal features to characterize various\nactivities. We also address the issues of false negative of tag readings and\ntag/antenna calibration, and design a fast online recognition system. Antenna\nand tag selection is done automatically to explore the minimum number of\ndevices required to achieve target accuracy. We develop a prototype system\nwhich consists of a wearable RFID system and a smartphone to demonstrate the\nworking principles, and conduct experimental studies with four subjects over\ntwo weeks. The results show that our system achieves a high recognition\naccuracy of 93.6 percent with a latency of 5 seconds.

A vehicle must be used for a full trip of a user\nfrom depot to depot. We aim at assigning vehicles to user trips so as to\nmaximize savings compared to other modes of transport.

In this paper, we discuss scheduling a single-server\nsystem when exact information about the jobs' processing times is not\navailable. When the SRPT policy uses estimated processing times, the\nunderestimation of large jobs can significantly degrade performance. We propose\na simple heuristic, Size Estimate Hedging (SEH), that only uses estimated\nprocessing times for scheduling decisions. A job's priority is increased\ndynamically according to an SRPT rule until it is determined that it is\nunderestimated, at which time the priority is frozen. Numerical results suggest\nthat SEH has desirable performance for estimation error variance that is\nconsistent with what is seen in practice.\n",

It is based on the Involution Delay Model (IDM)\n[F\\\"ugger et al., IEEE TCAD 2020], which has been shown to be the only existing\ncandidate for faithful glitch propagation known so far. In its present form,\nhowever, it has shortcomings that limit its practical applicability and\nutility. First, IDM delay predictions are conceptually based on discretizing\nthe analog signal waveforms using specific matching input and output\ndiscretization threshold voltages. Unfortunately, they are difficult to\ndetermine and typically different for interconnected gates. Second,\nmetastability and high-frequency oscillations in a real circuit could be\ninvisible in the IDM signal predictions. Our CIDM reduces the characterization\neffort by allowing independent discretization thresholds, improves\ncomposability and increases the modeling power by exposing canceled pulse\ntrains at the gate interconnect. We formally show that, despite these\nimprovements, the CIDM still retains the IDM's faithfulness, which is a\nconsequence of the mathematical properties of involution delay functions.\n",

Traditionally, the success of conceptual\nmodelling techniques has depended largely on the adequacy of conceptualisation,\nexpressive power, comprehensibility and formal foundation. An equally important\nrequirement, particularly with the increased conceptualisation of business\naspects, is \\EM{business suitability}. In this paper, the focus is on the\nbusiness suitability of workflow modelling for a commonly encountered class of\n(operational) business processing, e.g. those of insurance claims, bank loans\nand land conveyancing. A general assessment is first conducted on some\n\\EM{integrated} techniques characterising well-known paradigms - structured\nprocess modelling, object-oriented modelling, behavioural process modelling and\nbusiness-oriented modelling. Through this, an insight into business suitability\nwithin the broader perspective of technique adequacy, is gained. A specific\nbusiness suitability diagnosis then follows using a particular characterisation\nof business processing, i.e.\\ one where the intuitive semantics and\ninter-relationship of business services and business processes are nuanced. As\na result, five business suitability principles are elicited. These are proposed\nfor a more detailed understanding and (synthetic) development of workflow\nmodelling techniques. Accordingly, further insight into workflow specification\nlanguages and workflow globalisation in open distributed architectures may also\nbe gained.\n",

While these provide reasonable\nestimations at very low execution time in the average case, their ability to\ncover complex signal traces is limited. Research has provided the dynamic\nInvolution Delay Model (IDM) as a promising alternative, which was shown (i) to\ndepict reality more closely and recently (ii) to be compatible with modern\nsimulation suites. In this paper we complement these encouraging results by\nexperimentally exploring the behavioral coverage for more advanced circuits. In\ndetail we apply the IDM to three simple circuits (a combinatorial loop, an SR\nlatch and an adder), interpret the delivered results and evaluate the overhead\nin realistic settings. Comparisons to digital (inertial delay) and analog\n(SPICE) simulations reveal, that the IDM delivers very fine-grained results,\nwhich match analog simulations very closely. Moreover, severe shortcomings of\ninertial delay become apparent in our simulations, as it fails to depict a\nrange of malicious behaviors. Overall the Involution Delay Model hence\nrepresents a viable upgrade to the available delay models in modern digital\ntiming simulation tools.\n",

They depict electrical\ncomponents in a symbolic and graph-based manner. While the circuit design is\nusually performed electronically, there are still legacy paper-based diagrams\nthat require digitization in order to be used in CAE systems.

The\ngraph-based nature of these documents can be exploited by semantic\ntechnology-based reasoning in order to generate human-understandable\ndescriptions of their functional principles. More precisely, each electrical\ncomponent (e.g. a diode) of a circuit may be assigned a high-level function\nlabel which describes its purpose within the device (e.g. flyback diode for\nreverse voltage protection). In this paper, forward chaining rules are used for\nsuch a generation. The described approach is applicable for both CAE-based\ncircuits as well as raw circuits yielded by an image understanding pipeline.\nThe viability of the approach is demonstrated by application to an existing set\nof circuits.\n",

In the UK, SAR teams are typically charities with limited resources,\nand SAR missions are time critical. Search managers need to objectively decide\nwhich search assets (e.g. helicopter vs drone) would be better. A key metric in\nthe SAR community is effective sweep width (W), which provides a single measure\nfor a search asset's ability to detect a specific object in specific\nenvironmental conditions. Tables of W for different search assets are provided\nin various manuals, such as the International Aeronautical and Maritime SAR\n(IAMSAR) Manual.

This paper uses the\nVienna Development Method (VDM) to build an initial model of W for a known case\n(helicopters at sea) with a view to predicting W tables for drones. The model\ncomputes W for various search object sizes, helicopter altitude and visibility.\nThe results for the model are quite different from the published tables, which\nshows that the abstraction level is not yet correct, however it produced useful\ninsights and directions for the next steps.\n",

This article presents a systematic interdisciplinary survey that\ncomprehensively and holistically scrutinizes OD flows from utilizing\nfundamental theory to studying the mechanism of population mobility and solving\npractical problems with engineering techniques, such as computational models.\nSpecifically, regional economics, urban geography, and sociophysics are adept\nat employing theoretical research methods to explore the underlying mechanisms\nof OD flows. They have developed three influential theoretical models: the\ngravity model, the intervening opportunities model, and the radiation model.\nThese models specifically focus on examining the fundamental influences of\ndistance, opportunities, and population on OD flows, respectively. In the\nmeantime, fields such as transportation, urban planning, and computer science\nprimarily focus on addressing four practical problems: OD prediction, OD\nconstruction, OD estimation, and OD forecasting. Advanced computational models,\nsuch as deep learning models, have gradually been introduced to address these\nproblems more effectively. Finally, based on the existing research, this survey\nsummarizes current challenges and outlines future directions for this topic.\nThrough this survey, we aim to break down the barriers between disciplines in\nOD flow-related research, fostering interdisciplinary perspectives and modes of\nthinking.\n",

The inherent logic of agency exists in natural processes at various\nlevels, under information exchanges. It applies to humans, animals, and\nartifactual agents. The common human-centric, natural language-based logic is\nan example of complex logic evolved by living organisms that already appears in\nthe simplest form at the level of basal cognition of unicellular organisms.\nThus, cognitive logic stems from the evolution of physical, chemical, and\nbiological logic. In a computing nature framework with a self-organizing\nagency, innovative computational frameworks grounded in\nmorphological/physical/natural computation can be used to explain the genesis\nof human-centered logic through the steps of naturalized logical processes at\nlower levels of organization. The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis of living\nagents is essential for understanding the emergence of human-level logic and\nthe relationship between logic and information processing/computational\nepistemology.

Clinical coders and physicians\nassign codes to patient episodes based on their interpretation of case notes or\nelectronic patient records. Therefore, accurate coding relies on the legibility\nof case notes and the coders' understanding of medical terminology. During the\nlast ten years, many studies have shown poor reproducibility of clinical\ncoding, even recently, with the application of Artificial Intelligence-based\nmodels. Given this context, the paper aims to present the SISCO.web approach\ndesigned to support physicians in filling in Hospital Discharge Records with\nproper diagnoses and procedures codes using the International Classification of\nDiseases (9th and 10th), and, above all, in identifying the main pathological\ncondition. The web service leverages NLP algorithms, specific coding rules, as\nwell as ad hoc decision trees to identify the main condition, showing promising\nresults in providing accurate ICD coding suggestions.\n",

        "summary": "  DNA data storage is rapidly gaining traction as a long-term data archival\nsolution, primarily due to its exceptional durability. Retrieving stored data\nrelies on DNA sequencing, which involves a process called basecalling -- a\ntypically costly and slow task that uses machine learning to map raw sequencing\nsignals back to individual DNA bases (which are then translated into digital\nbits to recover the data). Current models for basecalling have been optimized\nfor reading individual bases. However, with the advent of novel DNA synthesis\nmethods tailored for data storage, there is significant potential for\noptimizing the reading process. In this paper, we focus on Motif-based DNA\nsynthesis, where sequences are constructed from motifs -- groups of bases --\nrather than individual bases. To enable efficient reading of data stored in DNA\nusing Motif-based DNA synthesis, we designed Motif Caller, a machine learning\nmodel built to detect entire motifs within a DNA sequence, rather than\nindividual bases. Motifs can also be detected from individually identified\nbases using a basecaller and then searching for motifs, however, such an\napproach is unnecessarily complex and slow. Building a machine learning model\nthat directly identifies motifs allows to avoid the additional step of\nsearching for motifs. It also makes use of the greater amount of features per\nmotif, thus enabling finding the motifs with higher accuracy. Motif Caller\nsignificantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of data retrieval in DNA\nstorage based on Motif-Based DNA synthesis.\n",

Given the stochastic features of these elements, most\nmodeling approaches rely on Monte Carlo simulation. The computational costs\nassociated to the simulation approach force to treating mostly small-sized\nsystems, i.e. with a limited number of lumped components of a given renewable\ntechnology (e.g. wind or solar, etc.) whose behavior is described by a binary\nstate, working or failed. In this paper, we propose an analytical multi-state\nmodeling approach for the reliability assessment of distributed generation\n(DG). The approach allows looking to a number of diverse energy generation\ntechnologies distributed on the system. Multiple states are used to describe\nthe randomness in the generation units, due to the stochastic nature of the\ngeneration sources and of the mechanical degradation/failure behavior of the\ngeneration systems. The universal generating function (UGF) technique is used\nfor the individual component multi-state modeling. A multiplication-type\ncomposition operator is introduced to combine the UGFs for the mechanical\ndegradation and renewable generation source states into the UGF of the\nrenewable generator power output. The overall multi-state DG system UGF is then\nconstructed and classical reliability indices (e.g. loss of load expectation\n(LOLE), expected energy not supplied (EENS)) are computed from the DG system\ngeneration and load UGFs. An application of the model is shown on a DG system\nadapted from the IEEE 34 nodes distribution test feeder.\n",

The content of this article is a sub-proposal to the IEEE\n802.15.7r1 Task Group (TG7r1) aimed at Optical Wireless Communication (OWC)\nusing an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is\nindispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter\nimage sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds,\nsampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional\ncommunications (i.e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous\ncommunication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical\nlimitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying\nframe rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed\nperformance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of\ncamera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested\nalong with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms.\nA significant feature of our novel data frame structure is that it can support\nboth typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low\nframe rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate\nis lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i.e., no\nless than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority\nvoting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i.e., when\nthe frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by\nan error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in\ndecoding and later corrected by external code. Numerical results and valuable\nanalysis are also included to indicate the capability of the proposed schemes.\n",

DAVE-2 uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN),\nwhich takes images from a front-facing camera as input and produces car\nsteering angles as output. DeepPicar uses the same network architecture---9\nlayers, 27 million connections and 250K parameters---and can drive itself in\nreal-time using a web camera and a Raspberry Pi 3 quad-core platform. Using\nDeepPicar, we analyze the Pi 3's computing capabilities to support end-to-end\ndeep learning based real-time control of autonomous vehicles. We also\nsystematically compare other contemporary embedded computing platforms using\nthe DeepPicar's CNN-based real-time control workload. We find that all tested\nplatforms, including the Pi 3, are capable of supporting the CNN-based\nreal-time control, from 20 Hz up to 100 Hz, depending on hardware platform.\nHowever, we find that shared resource contention remains an important issue\nthat must be considered in applying CNN models on shared memory based embedded\ncomputing platforms; we observe up to 11.6X execution time increase in the CNN\nbased control loop due to shared resource contention. To protect the CNN\nworkload, we also evaluate state-of-the-art cache partitioning and memory\nbandwidth throttling techniques on the Pi 3. We find that cache partitioning is\nineffective, while memory bandwidth throttling is an effective solution.\n",

With the development of domestic\nremote sensing technology, the application of Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution\nremote sensing images can greatly improve the accuracy of information\nextraction. This paper introduces an approach using object-oriented\nclassification methods for urban feature extraction based on GF-2 satellite\ndata. A combination of spectral, spatial attributes and membership functions\nwas employed for mapping the urban features of Qinhuai District, Nanjing. The\ndata preprocessing is carried out by ENVI software, and the subsequent data is\nexported into the eCognition software for object-oriented classification and\nextraction of urban feature information. Finally, the obtained raster image\nclassification results are vectorized using the ARCGIS software, and the vector\ngraphics are stored in the library, which can be used for further analysis and\nmodeling. Accuracy assessment was performed using ground truth data acquired by\nvisual interpretation and from other reliable secondary data sources. Compared\nwith the result of pixel-based supervised (neural net) classification, the\ndeveloped object-oriented method can significantly improve extraction accuracy,\nand after manual interpretation, an overall accuracy of 95.44% can be achieved,\nwith a Kappa coefficient of 0.9405, which objectively confirmed the superiority\nof the object-oriented method and the feasibility of the utilization of GF-2\nsatellite data.\n",

The press abounds in\nexamples illustrating these aspects, but one should draw not hasty and\npremature conclusions. The first successes in AI have been a surprise for\nsociety at large-including researchers in the field. Today, after the initial\nstupefaction, we have examples of the system reactions: traditional companies\nare heavily investing in AI, social platforms are monitored during elections,\ndata collection is more and more regulated, etc. The resilience of an\norganization (i.e. its capacity to resist to a shock) relies deeply on the\nperception of its environment. Future problems have to be anticipated, while\nunforeseen events occurring have to be quickly identified in order to be\nmitigated as fast as possible. The author states that this clear perception\nstarts with a common definition of AI in terms of capacities and limits. AI\npractitioners should make notions and concepts accessible to the general public\nand the impacted fields (e.g. industries, law, education). It is a truism that\nonly law experts would have the potential to estimate IA impacts on judicial\nsystem. However, questions remain on how to connect different kind of expertise\nand what is the appropriate level of detail required for the knowledge\nexchanges. And the same consideration is true for dissemination towards\nsociety. Ultimately, society will live with decisions made by the \"experts\". It\nsounds wise to involve society in the decision process rather than risking to\npay consequences later. Therefore, society also needs the key concepts to\nunderstand AI impact on their life. This was the purpose of the trial of an IA\nthat took place in October 2018 at the Court of Appeal of Paris: gathering\nexperts from various fields to expose challenges in law and science towards a\ngeneral public.\n",

However, lossy compressor developers and\nusers are missing a tool to explore the features of scientific datasets and\nunderstand the data alteration after compression in a systematic and reliable\nway. To address this gap, we have designed and implemented a generic framework\ncalled Z-checker. On the one hand, Z-checker combines a battery of data\nanalysis components for data compression. On the other hand, Z-checker is\nimplemented as an open-source community tool to which users and developers can\ncontribute and add new analysis components based on their additional analysis\ndemands. In this paper, we present a survey of existing lossy compressors. Then\nwe describe the design framework of Z-checker, in which we integrated\nevaluation metrics proposed in prior work as well as other analysis tools.\nSpecifically, for lossy compressor developers, Z-checker can be used to\ncharacterize critical properties of any dataset to improve compression\nstrategies. For lossy compression users, Z-checker can detect the compression\nquality, provide various global distortion analysis comparing the original data\nwith the decompressed data and statistical analysis of the compression error.\nZ-checker can perform the analysis with either coarse granularity or fine\ngranularity, such that the users and developers can select the best-fit,\nadaptive compressors for different parts of the dataset. Z-checker features a\nvisualization interface displaying all analysis results in addition to some\nbasic views of the datasets such as time series.

However, if AI is to improve\npeople's lives, then people must be able to trust AI, which means being able to\nunderstand what the system is doing and why. Even though transparency is often\nseen as the requirement in this case, realistically it might not always be\npossible or desirable, whereas the need to ensure that the system operates\nwithin set moral bounds remains. In this paper, we present an approach to\nevaluate the moral bounds of an AI system based on the monitoring of its inputs\nand outputs. We place a \"glass box\" around the system by mapping moral values\ninto explicit verifiable norms that constrain inputs and outputs, in such a way\nthat if these remain within the box we can guarantee that the system adheres to\nthe value. The focus on inputs and outputs allows for the verification and\ncomparison of vastly different intelligent systems; from deep neural networks\nto agent-based systems. The explicit transformation of abstract moral values\ninto concrete norms brings great benefits in terms of explainability;\nstakeholders know exactly how the system is interpreting and employing relevant\nabstract moral human values and calibrate their trust accordingly. Moreover, by\noperating at a higher level we can check the compliance of the system with\ndifferent interpretations of the same value. These advantages will have an\nimpact on the well-being of AI systems users at large, building their trust and\nproviding them with concrete knowledge on how systems adhere to moral values.\n",

This result has\nwide application importance for scenarios with strong interference, i.e. when\nco-located users utilize the internet in stadium, highway, shopping center,\netc. Simulation results are presented for the non-line of sight 3D-UMa model of\n5G QuaDRiGa 2.0 channel for 16 highly correlated single-antenna users with\nQAM16 modulation in 64 antennas of Massive MIMO system. The performance was\ncompared with MMSE and other detection approaches.\n",

It is widely admitted that between 5% to 10% of the world\npopulation is subject to this kind of disabilities. For assessing such\ndisabilities in early childhood, children have to solve a battery of tests.\nHuman experts score these tests, and decide whether the children require\nspecific education strategy on the basis of their marks. The assessment can be\nlengthy, costly and emotionally painful. In this paper, we investigate how\nArtificial Intelligence can help in automating this assessment. Gathering a\ndataset of handwritten text pictures and audio recordings, both from standard\nchildren and from dyslexic and/or dysgraphic children, we apply machine\nlearning techniques for classification in order to analyze the differences\nbetween dyslexic/dysgraphic and standard readers/writers and to build a model.\nThe model is trained on simple features obtained by analysing the pictures and\nthe audio files. Our preliminary implementation shows relatively high\nperformances on the dataset we have used. This suggests the possibility to\nscreen dyslexia and dysgraphia via non-invasive methods in an accurate way as\nsoon as enough data are available.\n",

Unfortunately, several types of appliances (e.g., switching\nmode power supply (SMPS) or multi-state) are known to challenge\nstate-of-the-art event detection systems due to their noisy consumption\nprofiles. Classical rule-based event detection system become infeasible and\ncomplex for these appliances.

The results show a false positive decrease by more\nthan a factor of eight on a dataset that has a strong focus on SMPS-driven\nappliances. To obtain a stable event detection system, we applied several\nexperiments on different parameters to measure its performance. These\nexperiments include the evaluation of six event features from the spectral and\ntime domain, different types of feature space normalization to eliminate\nundesired feature weighting, the conventional and adaptive training, and two\ncommon classifiers with its optimal parameter settings.

Currently, scenario-based approaches are investigated in research\nand industry, aiming at a reduction of testing efforts by specifying safety\nrelevant scenarios. To define those scenarios and operate in a complex\nreal-world design domain, a structured description of the environment is\nneeded.

As defined in PEGASUS, the 6LM\nprovides the possibility to categorize the environment and, therefore,\nfunctions as a structured basis for subsequent scenario description. The model\nenables a structured description and categorization of the general environment,\nwithout incorporating any knowledge or anticipating any functions of actors.\nBeyond that, there is a variety of other applications of the 6LM, which are\nelaborated in this paper. The 6LM includes a description of the road network\nand traffic guidance objects, roadside structures, temporary modifications of\nthe former, dynamic objects, environmental conditions and digital information.\nThe work at hand specifies each layer by categorizing its items.

Important inputs to such models, in addition to\norigin-destination flows, include passenger path choices and train capacity.\nTrain capacity, which has often been overlooked in the literature, is an\nimportant input that exhibits a lot of variabilities. The paper proposes a\nsimulation-based optimization (SBO) framework to simultaneously calibrate path\nchoices and train capacity for urban rail systems using AFC and AVL data. The\ncalibration is formulated as an optimization problem with a black-box objective\nfunction. Seven algorithms from four branches of SBO solving methods are\nevaluated. The algorithms are evaluated using an experimental design that\nincludes five scenarios, representing different degrees of path choice\nrandomness and crowding sensitivity. Data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit\nRailway (MTR) system is used as a case study. The data is used to generate\nsynthetic observations used as \"ground truth\". The results show that the\nresponse surface methods (particularly Constrained Optimization using Response\nSurfaces) have consistently good performance under all scenarios.

Worldwide\nuse of EVs, for their limited battery capacity, calls for effective planning of\nEVs charging stations to enhance the efficiency of using EVs. This paper\nprovides a methodology of describing EV detouring behavior for recharging, and\nbased on this, we adopt the extra driving length caused by detouring and the\nlength of uncompleted route as the indicators of evaluating an EV charging\nstation deployment plan. In this way, we can simulate EV behavior based on\ntravel data (demand). Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) based EV charging station\nsitting optimization method is developed to obtain an effective plan. A\ndetailed case study based on a 100-node 203-branch transportation network\nwithin a 30 km * 30 km region is included to test the effectiveness of our\nmethod.

However, also\nnew issues arise for car manufacturers: During charging and discharging of EV\nbatteries a degradation (battery aging) occurs that correlates with a value\ndepreciation of the entire EV. As EV users' satisfaction depends on reliable\nand value-stable products, car manufacturers offer charging assistants for\nsimplified and sustainable EV usage by considering individual customer needs\nand battery aging. Hitherto models to quantify battery aging have limited\npracticability due to a complex execution. Data-driven methods hold feasible\nalternatives for SOH estimation. However, the existing approaches barely use\nuser-related data. By means of a linear and a neural network regression model,\nwe first estimate the energy consumption for driving considering individual\ndriving styles and environmental conditions. In following work, the consumption\nmodel trained on data from batteries without degradation can be used to\nestimate the energy consumption for EVs with aged batteries. A discrepancy\nbetween the estimation and the real consumption indicates a battery aging\ncaused by increased internal losses. We then target to evaluate the influence\nof charging strategies on battery degradation.\n",

Since its first introduction in\n2003 by Grieves, digital twin has gained momentum in a wide range of\napplications such as industrial manufacturing, automotive and artificial\nintelligence. However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in\nindustries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical\nthings with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we\nintroduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop\nArchitecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a\ndigital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS)\nmodel of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin\nwith different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism\nfor execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop\napplications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin\nwith the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A\ndigital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using\nTiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data\nfor monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.\n",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based FPGA function block detection method with\nthree major steps. In specific, we first analyze the format of the bitstream to\nobtain the mapping relationship between the configuration bits and configurable\nlogic blocks because of the discontinuity of the configuration bits in the\nbitstream for one element. In order to reap the maturity of object detection\ntechniques based on deep learning, our next step is to convert an FPGA\nbitstream to an image, following the proposed transformation method that takes\naccount of both the adjacency nature of the programmable logic and the high\ndegree of redundancy of configuration information. Once the image is obtained,\na deep learning-based object detection algorithm is applied to this transformed\nimage, and the objects detected can be reflected back to determine the function\nblocks of the original FPGA design. The deep neural network used for function\nblock detection is trained and validated with a specially crafted\nbitstream/image dataset. Experiments have confirmed high detection accuracy of\nthe proposed function detection method, showing a 98.11% of mean Average\nPrecision (IoU=0.5) for 10 function blocks within a YOLOv3 detector implemented\non Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoCs and Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.\n",

The\nresults show that, by achieving 76.20% 4-class classification accuracy, FBCNet\nsets a new SOTA for BCIC-IV-2a dataset. On the other three datasets, FBCNet\nyields up to 8% higher binary classification accuracies.

However, certain kinds of sequential circuits do not refer to\nall of the past inputs to generate the current output; they only refer to a\nsubset of past inputs. This paper investigates which subset of past inputs a\nsequential circuit refers to, and proposes a new classification of sequential\ncircuits based on this criterion. The conventional classification of sequential\ncircuits distinguishes between synchronous and asynchronous circuits. In\ncontrast, the new classification consolidates synchronous circuits and multiple\nclock domain circuits into the same category.\n",

I leverage this system to\npromote a language of experimental designs by proposing a novel computational\nframework, called \"the grammar of experimental designs\", to specify\nexperimental designs based on an object-oriented programming system that\ndeclaratively encapsulates the experimental structure. The framework aims to\nengage human cognition by building experimental designs with modular functions\nthat modify a targeted singular element of the experimental design object. The\nsyntax and semantics of the framework are built upon consideration from\nmultiple perspectives. While the core framework is language-agnostic, the\nframework is implemented in the `edibble` R-package. A range of examples is\nshown to demonstrate the utility of the framework.\n",

However, differences in implementation of the\ncontroller area network (CAN) used by each vehicle manufacturer poses a\nsignificant challenge to achieving large-scale implementation of retrofits. To\naddress this challenge, this research proposes a method for reverse engineering\nthe CAN channels associated with a vehicle's accelerator and brake pedals,\nwithout any prior knowledge of the vehicle. By simultaneously recording\ninertial measurement unit (IMU) and CAN data during vehicle operation, the\nproposed algorithms can identify the CAN channels that correspond to each\ncontrol. During testing of six vehicles from three manufacturers, the proposed\nmethod was shown to successfully identify the CAN channels for the accelerator\npedal and brake pedal for each vehicle tested. These promising results\ndemonstrate the potential for using this approach for developing aftermarket\nautonomous vehicle kits - potentially with additional research to facilitate\nreal-time use. Notably, the proposed system has the potential to maintain its\neffectiveness despite changes in vehicle CAN standards, and it could\npotentially be adapted to function with any vehicle communications medium.\n",

Therefore, PAPR reduction capabilities are\nrestricted by both a limited bandwidth and the reduced size of digital space.\nThe problem is to meet both conditions. Moreover, the major HBF advantage is a\nreduced system complexity, thus the complexity of the PAPR reduction algorithm\nis expected to be low. To justify the performance of the proposed trainable LS,\nwe provide a performance bound achieved by convex optimization using the CVX\nMatlab package. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm can be\ncomparable to the minimal complexity of the digital ``twin'' calculation in\nHBF. The abovementioned features prove the feasibility of the trained LS for\nPAPR reduction in fully-connected HBF.\n",

It combines beamforming in both analog (via phase shifters) and\ndigital domains, resulting in low power consumption and high spectral\nefficiency. In practice, the problem of joint beamforming in multi-user\nscenarios is still open because an analog beam can't cover all users\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach to divide\nusers into clusters. Each cluster consists of users inside a virtual sector\nproduced by the analog beamforming of an HBF-based mMIMO receiver. Thus, inside\neach sector, a lower-cost digital beamforming serves a limited number of users\nwithin the same cluster. Simulations with realistic non-line-of-sight scenarios\ngenerated by the QuaDRiGa 2.0 demonstrate that our methods outperform standard\nFFT-based alternatives and almost achieve SVD-based beamspace performance\nbound.\n",
