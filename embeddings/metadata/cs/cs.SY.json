The\nscheduling problem is phrased as a control problem, and control-theoretical\ntechniques are used to design a scheduling algorithm that meets specific\nrequirements. Unlike most approaches to feedback scheduling, where a controller\nintegrates a \"basic\" scheduling algorithm and dynamically tunes its parameters\nand hence its performances, our methodology essentially reduces the design of a\nscheduling algorithm to the synthesis of a controller that closes the feedback\nloop. This approach allows the re-use of control-theoretical techniques to\ndesign efficient scheduling algorithms; it frames and solves the scheduling\nproblem in a general setting; and it can naturally tackle certain peculiar\nrequirements such as robustness and dynamic performance tuning. A few\nexperiments demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on a real-time\nbenchmark.\n",

This proof of convergence is general since it can be applied to analyze\nrandomized adaptive distributed beamforming schemes with any type of objective\nfunctions and probability measures as long as both the sufficient conditions\nare satisfied. Further, this framework can be generalized to analyze an\nasynchronous scheme where distributed transmitters can only update their\nbeamforming coefficients asynchronously.

Optimal rigid transformation\nbetween two different geometries is discussed with especial focus on the\nscaling operation, and the cooperative performance of the system is evaluated\nby what we call the geometries degrees of similarity (DOS) with respect to the\ndesired shape during the entire convergence process. The design of the scale\nwhen measuring the DOS is discussed from constant value and time-varying\nfunction perspectives respectively. Fixed structured nonlinear control laws\nthat are functions on the scale are developed to guarantee the exponential\nconvergence of the system to the assigned shape. Our research is originated\nfrom a three-agent formation system and is further extended to multiple (n > 3)\nagents by defining a triangular complement graph. Simulations demonstrate that\nformation system with the time-varying scale function outperforms the one with\nan arbitrary constant scale, and the relationship between underlying topology\nand the system performance is further discussed based on the simulation\nobservations.

We developed paraglide in close collaboration with experts\nfrom three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models\nfor their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and\nderived a set of design requirements, then engaged in a longitudinal\nuser-centered design process, and finally conducted three in-depth case studies\nunderlining the usefulness of our approach.\n",

For both the algorithms, in each iteration, the set of potential\natoms is found using a standard matched filter. In case of the first scheme, we\npropose an orthogonal projection strategy that selects an atom from the set of\npotential atoms. Then, for the second scheme, we propose a look ahead strategy\nsuch that the selection of an atom in the current iteration has an effect on\nthe future iterations. The use of look ahead strategy requires a higher\ncomputational resource. To achieve a trade-off between performance and\ncomplexity, we use the two new schemes in cascade and develop a third new\nalgorithm.

Three\nlongitudinal case studies in B2B equipment-based 'complex service' systems were\nanalysed to gain an understanding of customers' co-creation activities to\nachieve outcomes. We found the nature of value, degree of contextual variety\nand the firm's legacy viability to be viability threats. To counter this, the\nfirm uses (a) Direct Service Provision for Scalability and Replicability, (b)\nIndirect Service Provision for variety absorption and co-creating emotional\nvalue and customer experience and (c) designing direct and indirect provision\nfor Scalability and Absorptive Resources of the customer. The co-creation of\ncomplex multidimensional value could be delivered through different value\npropositions of the firm. The research proposes a value-centric way of\nunderstanding the interactions between direct and indirect service provision in\nthe design of the firm's value proposition and proposes a viable systems\napproach towards reorganising the firm. The study provides a way for managers\nto understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of the firm in\nco-creating value as a major issue in the design of complex socio-technical\nsystems. Goods are often designed within the domain of engineering and product\ndesign, often placing human activity as a supporting role to the equipment.\nThrough an SDLogic lens, this study considers the design of both equipment and\nhuman activity on an equal footing for value co-creation with the customer, and\nit yielded interesting results on when direct provisioning (goods) should be\nredesigned, considering all activities equally.\n",

An automata-based control framework is\nformalized, upon which we develop three architectures with respect to different\ndecision fusion rules for the decentralized bisimilarity control, named a\nconjunctive architecture, a disjunctive architecture and a general\narchitecture. Under theses three architectures, necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of decentralized bisimilarity supervisors are\nderived respectively, which extend the traditional results of supervisory\ncontrol from language equivalence to bisimulation equivalence.

We consider a power system consisting of thermal power plants,\nphotovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze the effect of the\nforecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the\noperation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden\ndecrease in wind power is also analyzed. More thermal power plants need to be\noperated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The\nincrease in the number of operating thermal power plants within a short period\ndoes not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the\nsubstitution of thermal power plants by wind farms or PV systems is not\nexpected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the\ncase of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed.

First, by embedding the problem within a stochastic framework, we\npresent a novel algorithm for the SCP that: (i) is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., it produces, almost surely, a solution approaching the optimal one as the\nnumber of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; and (ii) has computational\ncomplexity $O(n^{2+\\eps})$, where $n$ is the number of pickup/delivery pairs\nand $\\eps$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant.

Finally, we study a dynamic\nversion of the SCP, whereby pickup and delivery requests arrive according to a\nPoisson process, and which serves as a model for large-scale demand-responsive\ntransport (DRT) systems. For such a dynamic counterpart of the SCP, we derive a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable vehicle routing\npolicies, which depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic\ndistributions of pickup and delivery points, the arrival rate of requests, and\nthe number of vehicles. Our results leverage a novel connection between the\nEuclidean Bipartite Matching Problem and the theory of random permutations,\nand, for the dynamic setting, exhibit novel features that are absent in\ntraditional spatially-distributed queueing systems.\n",

The non linear systems control is based on several\ndifferent approaches, among it the sliding mode control. The sliding mode\ncontrol has proved its effectiveness through the different studies. The\nadvantage that makes such an important approach is its robustness versus the\ndisturbances and the model uncertainties.

We use a local state-based\nscheduler to select a few critical data packets to send to the MAC. In this\npaper, we analyze the impact of such a scheduler on the closed-loop system in\nthe presence of traffic, and show that there is a dual effect with state-based\nscheduling. In general, this makes the optimal scheduler and controller hard to\nfind. However, by removing past controls from the scheduling criterion, we find\nthat certainty equivalence holds. This condition is related to the classical\nresult of Bar-Shalom and Tse, and it leads to the design of a scheduler with a\ncertainty equivalent controller. This design, however, does not result in an\nequivalent system to the original problem, in the sense of Witsenhausen.\nComputing the estimate is difficult, but can be simplified by introducing a\nsymmetry constraint on the scheduler. Based on these findings, we propose a\ndual predictor architecture for the closed-loop system, which ensures\nseparation between scheduler, observer and controller.

The introduced clustered turbo equalizer uses piecewise linear\nmodels to capture the nonlinear dependency of the linear minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) symbol estimate on the symbol likelihoods produced by the channel\ndecoder and maintains a computational complexity that is only linear in the\nchannel memory. By partitioning the space of likelihood information from the\ndecoder, based on either hard or soft clustering, and using locally-linear\nadaptive equalizers within each clustered region, the performance gap between\nthe linear MMSE equalizer and low-complexity, LMS-based linear turbo equalizers\ncan be dramatically narrowed.\n",

This adaptive mixture is shown to achieve the mean square error\n(MSE) performance of the best constituent filter, and in some cases outperforms\nboth, in the steady-state. However, the MSE analysis of this mixture in the\nsteady-state and during the transient regions uses approximations and relies on\nstatistical models on the underlying signals and systems. Hence, such an\nanalysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real life\nsystems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and, in many\ncases, that are even chaotic. To this end, we perform the transient and the\nsteady-state analysis of this adaptive mixture in a \"strong\" deterministic\nsense without any approximations in the derivations or statistical assumptions\non the underlying signals such that our results are guaranteed to hold. In\nparticular, we relate the time-accumulated squared estimation error of this\nadaptive mixture at any time to the time-accumulated squared estimation error\nof the optimal convex mixture of the constituent filters directly tuned to the\nunderlying signal in an individual sequence manner.\n",

As the implementation of these\nstrategies in real-time controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the\nderivation of analytical dependency between controlled and control variables\nbecomes a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage and\npower flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical derivation of\nnode voltage and line current flows as a function of the nodal power injections\nand transformers tap-changers positions. Compared to other approaches presented\nin the literature, the one proposed here is based on the use of the [Y]\ncompound matrix of a generic multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to\nestimate the computational benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant\nimprovements are also quantified versus traditional methods.

To reduce the\ncomplexity and signaling overhead in practical systems, the BS-DTX control is\nadaptive to both the energy state information (ESI) and the data queue state\ninformation (QSI) over a longer timescale. The user scheduling is adaptive to\nthe ESI, the QSI and the channel state information (CSI) over a shorter\ntimescale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control problem can be\nmodeled as an infinite horizon average cost Partially Observed Markov Decision\nProblem (POMDP), which is well-known to be a difficult problem in general. By\nusing sample-path analysis and exploiting specific problem structure, we first\nobtain some structural results on the optimal control policy and derive an\nequivalent Bellman equation with reduced state space. To reduce the complexity\nand facilitate distributed implementation, we obtain a delay-aware distributed\nsolution with the BS-DTX control at the BS controller (BSC) and the user\nscheduling at each cluster manager (CM) using approximate dynamic programming\nand distributed stochastic learning. We show that the proposed distributed\ntwo-timescale algorithm converges almost surely.

In this contribution we improve the robustness and\ncomputational complexity aspects of this algorithm. The method is based on\nprojection in Krylov subspaces to improve complexity and a new criterion called\nthe Partial Effective Rank (PER) to estimate the level of sparsity to gain\nrobustness.\n  If P antennas measure a K-multipath channel with N uniformly sampled\nmeasurements per channel, the algorithm possesses an O(KPNlogN) complexity and\nan O(KPN) memory footprint instead of O(PN^3) and O(PN^2) for the direct\nimplementation, making it suitable for K << N. The sparsity is estimated online\nbased on the PER, and the algorithm therefore has a sense of introspection\nbeing able to relinquish sparsity if it is lacking. The estimation performances\nare tested on field measurements with synthetic AWGN, and the proposed\nalgorithm outperforms non-sparse reconstruction in the medium to low SNR range\n(< 0dB), increasing the rate of successful symbol decodings by 1/10th in\naverage, and 1/3rd in the best case. The experiments also show that the\nalgorithm does not perform worse than a non-sparse estimation algorithm in\nnon-sparse operating conditions, since it may fall-back to it if the PER\ncriterion does not detect a sufficient level of sparsity.\n  The algorithm is also tested against a method assuming a \"discrete\" sparsity\nmodel as in Compressed Sensing (CS).

In order to be k-resilient, a system needs to be\nable to rapidly recover from a small number, up to k, of local faults\ninfinitely many times, provided that blocks of up to k faults are separated by\nshort recovery periods in which no fault occurs. k-resilience is a simple but\npowerful abstraction from the precise distribution of local faults, but much\nmore refined than the traditional objective to maximize the number of local\nfaults. We argue why we believe this to be the right level of abstraction for\nsafety critical systems when local faults are few and far between.

The methodology involves the application of linear\nprecision temperature sensors i.e., they generate a voltage that is directly\nproportional to the temperature. Basically the system is constructed using\ntemperature sensors and comparators. The system is powered using a 12V power\nsupply. The results of the tests showed that the power output of the circuit is\nswitched OFF hence switching OFF the heating device or an alarm is triggered ON\nwhen the device exceeded a preset temperature level. The general operation of\nthe system and performance is dependent on the temperature difference between\nthe preset temperature value and external temperature intended to be monitored.\nThe overall system was tested and found perfectly functional.\n",

For the\nparticular case of legged locomotion, the movement of each leg is abstracted to\ntwo-state circuits: swing and stance (leg in flight and on the ground,\nrespectively).

Specifically, the resident\nelectricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic\nusage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled\nbased on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the\nMG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e.,\nQoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy\nresources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as\na constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization\ntechnique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling\nalgorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual\nqueues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require\nany statistics and future knowledge of the electricity supply, demand and price\nprocesses. We derive several \"hard\" performance bounds for the proposed\nalgorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations.

        "summary": "  Electricity peaks can be harmful to grid stability and result in additional\ngeneration costs to balance supply with demand. By developing a network of\nsmart appliances together with a quasi-decentralized control protocol, direct\nload control (DLC) provides an opportunity to reduce peak consumption by\ndirectly controlling the on/off switch of the networked appliances. This paper\nproposes a packetized DLC (PDLC) solution that is illustrated by an application\nto air conditioning temperature control. Here the term packetized refers to a\nfixed time energy usage authorization. The consumers in each room choose their\npreferred set point, and then an operator of the local appliance pool will\ndetermine the comfort band around the set point. We use a thermal dynamic model\nto investigate the duty cycle of thermostatic appliances. Three theorems are\nproposed in this paper. The first two theorems evaluate the performance of the\nPDLC in both transient and steady state operation. The first theorem proves\nthat the average room temperature would converge to the average room set point\nwith fixed number of packets applied in each discrete interval. The second\ntheorem proves that the PDLC solution guarantees to control the temperature of\nall the rooms within their individual comfort bands. The third theorem proposes\nan allocation method to link the results in theorem 1 and assumptions in\ntheorem 2 such that the overall PDLC solution works. The direct result of the\ntheorems is that we can reduce the consumption oscillation that occurs when no\ncontrol is applied. Simulation is provided to verify theoretical results.\n",

Based on a Markov jump process modelling of a group of\nthermostatic loads, this paper proposes a two level feedback system design\nbetween the independent system operator (ISO) and the regulation service\nprovider such that two objectives are achieved: (1) the ISO can optimally\ndispatch regulation signals to multiple providers in real time in order to\nreduce the requirement for expensive spinning reserves, and (2) each regulation\nprovider can control its thermostatic loads to respond the ISO signal. It is\nalso shown that the amount of regulation service that can be provided is\nimplicitly restricted by a few fundamental parameters of the provider itself,\nsuch as the allowable set point choice and its thermal constant. An interesting\nfinding is that the regulation provider's ability to provide a large amount of\nlong term accumulated regulation and short term signal tracking restrict each\nother.

A novel subcarrier-pair based opportunistic DF relaying protocol is\nproposed. Specifically, user message bits are transmitted in two time slots. A\nsubcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a subcarrier in the second slot\nfor the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In particular, the source and\nthe relay can transmit simultaneously to implement beamforming at the\nsubcarrier in the second slot. Each unpaired subcarrier in either the first or\nsecond slot is used for the source's direct transmission to a user. A benchmark\nprotocol, same as the proposed one except that the transmit beamforming is not\nused for the relay-aided transmission, is also considered. For each protocol, a\npolynomial-complexity algorithm is developed to find at least an approximately\noptimum resource allocation (RA), by using continuous relaxation, the dual\nmethod, and Hungarian algorithm. Instrumental to the algorithm design is an\nelegant definition of optimization variables, motivated by the idea of\nregarding the unpaired subcarriers as virtual subcarrier pairs in the direct\ntransmission mode. The effectiveness of the RA algorithm and the impact of\nrelay position and total power on the protocols' performance are illustrated by\nnumerical experiments. The proposed protocol always leads to a maximum WSR\nequal to or greater than that for the benchmark one, and the performance gain\nof using the proposed one is significant especially when the relay is in close\nproximity to the source and the total power is low. Theoretical analysis is\npresented to interpret these observations.\n",

We first derive tests for checking if a subsystem can\nbe plugged into (or unplugged from) an existing plant without spoiling overall\nstability and constraint satisfaction. When this is possible, we show how to\nautomatize the design of local controllers so that it can be carried out in\nparallel by smart actuators equipped with computational resources and capable\nto exchange information with neighboring subsystems. In particular, local\ncontrollers exploit tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in order to\nguarantee robustness with respect to physical coupling among subsystems.\nFinally, an application of the proposed control design procedure to frequency\ncontrol in power networks is presented.\n",

The design of numerical software is commonly done using\nfloating-point arithmetic in design-environments such as Matlab.

The fixed-point\nimplementation reduces implementation cost, provides better performance, and\nreduces power consumption.

Depending on whether the agent's\nfull state is available or not, two distributed protocols are proposed to\nensure that states of all agents can be convergent to a same stationary value.\nIn the proposed protocols, the gain vector associated with the agent's\n(estimated) state and the gain vector associated with the relative (estimated)\nstates between agents are designed in a sophisticated way. By this particular\ndesign, the high-order integral multi-agent system can be transformed into a\nfirst-order integral multi-agent system. And the convergence of the transformed\nfirst-order integral agent's state indicates the convergence of the original\nhigh-order integral agent's state if and only if all roots of the polynomial,\nwhose coefficients are the entries of the gain vector associated with the\nrelative (estimated) states between agents, are in the open left-half complex\nplane. Therefore, many analysis techniques in the first-order integral\nmulti-agent system can be directly borrowed to solve the problems in the\nhigh-order integral multi-agent system. Due to this property, it is proved that\nto reach a consensus, the switching directed topology of multi-agent system is\nonly required to be \"uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected\", which seems\nthe mildest connectivity condition in the literature. In addition, the\nconsensus problem of discrete-time high-order integral multi-agent systems is\nstudied. The corresponding consensus protocol and performance analysis are\npresented. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",

In recent years, the\ndevelopment of robots assisting in disaster mitigation in urban environments\nhas been actively encouraged, since robots can be deployed in dangerous and\nhazardous areas where human SAR operations would not be possible.\n  In order to meet the reliability requirements in SAR, the specifications of\nthe robots are stated in Linear Temporal Logic and synthesized into finite\nstate machines that can be executed as controllers. The resulting controllers\nare purely discrete and maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment\nby changing their internal state according to the inputs they receive from\nsensors or other robots.\n  Since SAR robots have to cooperate in order to complete the required tasks,\nthe synthesis of controllers that together achieve a common goal is considered.\nThis distributed synthesis problem is provably undecidable, hence it cannot be\nsolved in full generality, but a set of design principles is introduced in\norder to develop specialized synthesizable specifications. In particular,\ncommunication and cooperation are resolved by introducing a verified\nstandardized communication protocol and preempting negotiations between robots.\n  The robots move on a graph on which we consider the search for stationary and\nmoving targets. Searching for moving targets is cast into a game of cops and\nrobbers, and specifications implementing a winning strategy are developed so\nthat the number of robots required is minimized.\n  The viability of the methods is demonstrated by synthesizing controllers for\nrobots performing search and rescue for stationary targets and searching for\nmoving targets.

In\ncontrast to the existing stochastic approximation-based control algorithms\n(protocols), a local voting protocol with nonvanishing step size is proposed.\nNonvanishing (e.g., constant) step size protocols give the opportunity to\nachieve better convergence rate (by choosing proper step sizes) in coping with\ntime-varying loads and agent states. The price to pay is replacement of the\nmean square convergence with an approximate one. To analyze dynamics of the\nclosed loop system, the so-called method of averaged models is used. It allows\nto reduce analysis complexity of the closed loop system. In this paper the\nupper bounds for mean square distance between the initial system and its\napproximate averaged model are proposed. The proposed upper bounds are used to\nobtain conditions for approximate consensus achievement.\n  The method is applied to the load balancing problem in stochastic dynamic\nnetworks with incomplete information about the current states of agents and\nwith changing set of communication links. The load balancing problem is\nformulated as consensus problem in noisy model with switched topology. The\nconditions to achieve the optimal level of load balancing (in the sense that if\nno new task arrives, all agents will finish at the same time) are obtained.\n  The performance of the system is evaluated analytically and by simulation. It\nis shown that the performance of the adaptive multi-agent strategy with the\nredistribution of tasks among \"connected\" neighbors is significantly better\nthan the performance without redistribution. The obtained results are important\nfor control of production networks, multiprocessor, sensor or multicomputer\nnetworks, etc.\n",

The\nrate at which the follower agents converge to their desired states, as well as\nthe errors in the follower agent states prior to convergence, are determined by\nthe choice of leader agents. In this paper, we study leader selection in order\nto minimize convergence errors experienced by the follower agents, which we\ndefine as a norm of the distance between the follower agents' intermediate\nstates and the convex hull of the leader agent states. By introducing a novel\nconnection to random walks on the network graph, we show that the convergence\nerror has an inherent supermodular structure as a function of the leader set.\nSupermodularity enables development of efficient discrete optimization\nalgorithms that directly approximate the optimal leader set, provide provable\nperformance guarantees, and do not rely on continuous relaxations. We formulate\ntwo leader selection problems within the supermodular optimization framework,\nnamely, the problem of selecting a fixed number of leader agents in order to\nminimize the convergence error, as well as the problem of selecting the\nminimum-size set of leader agents to achieve a given bound on the convergence\nerror. We introduce algorithms for approximating the optimal solution to both\nproblems in static networks, dynamic networks with known topology\ndistributions, and dynamic networks with unknown and unpredictable topology\ndistributions.

The method is based on an adaptive gradient\ndescent algorithm that directly determines the time delay and magnitudes of two\nnoisy sinusoidal signals. The new estimator uses a novel quadrature carrier\ngenerator to produce the carriers for an adaptive quadrature phase detector,\nwhich in turn uses an arc tan function to compute the time delay.

The intersection of sub-level sets of the partitioning functions\ndefines cells, which are regarded as discrete objects. The union of cells makes\nup the state space of the dynamical systems. Our construction gives rise to a\ncombinatorial object - a timed automaton. We examine sound and complete\nabstractions. An abstraction is said to be sound when the flow of the time\nautomata covers the flow lines of the dynamical systems. If the dynamics of the\ndynamical system and the time automaton are equivalent, the abstraction is\ncomplete.\n  The commonly accepted paradigm for partitioning functions is that they ought\nto be transversal to the studied vector field. We show that there is no\ncomplete partitioning with transversal functions, even for particular dynamical\nsystems whose critical sets are isolated critical points. Therefore, we allow\nthe directional derivative along the vector field to be non-positive in this\nwork. This considerably complicates the abstraction technique. For\nunderstanding dynamical systems, it is vital to study stable and unstable\nmanifolds and their intersections. These objects appear naturally in this work.\nIndeed, we show that for an abstraction to be complete, the set of critical\npoints of an abstraction function shall contain either the stable or unstable\nmanifold of the dynamical system.\n",

The existing models for synthesizing and\nallocating forces in such suspensions are conservatively based on the\nconstraint that no wheels lift off the ground. However, in practice,\nsmart/active suspensions are more necessary in the situation where the wheels\nhave just lifted off the ground. The difficulty in computing control in the\nlast situation is that the problem requires satisfying disjunctive constraints\non the dynamics. To the authors',knowledge, no efficient solution method is\navailable for the simulation of dynamics with disjunctive constraints and thus\nhardware realizable and accurate force allocation in an active suspension tends\nto be a difficulty. In this work we give an algorithm for and simulate\nnumerical solutions of the force allocation problem as an optimal control\nproblem constrained by dynamics with disjunctive constraints. In particular we\nstudy the allocation and synthesis of time-dependent active suspension forces\nin terms of sensor output data in order to stabilize the roll motion of the\nroad vehicle. An equivalent constraint in the form of a convex combination\n(hull) is proposed to satisfy the disjunctive constraints. The validated\nnumerical simulations show that it is possible to allocate and synthesize\ncontrol forces at the active suspensions from sensor output data such that the\nforces stabilize the roll moment of the vehicle with its wheels just lifted off\nthe ground during arbitrary fish-hook maneuvers.\n",

Firstly, the\ntemporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the\nstate estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support\ncould be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the\nlinear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the\nKalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case,\ncompressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the\nparticle filter would perform poorly.

Previous literature suggests that these\nproblems are symptomatic of poor muscle control and non-physiological muscle\nfiber recruitment. The latter is a known problem with FES in general, and the\nformer motivates investigation of better control methods for FES-cycling.In\nthis paper, a stimulation pattern for quadriceps femoris-only FES-cycling is\nderived based on the effectiveness of knee joint torque in producing forward\npedaling. In addition, a switched sliding-mode controller is designed for the\nuncertain, nonlinear cycle-rider system with autonomous state-dependent\nswitching. The switched controller yields ultimately bounded tracking of a\ndesired trajectory in the presence of an unknown, time-varying, bounded\ndisturbance, provided a reverse dwell-time condition is satisfied by\nappropriate choice of the control gains and a sufficient desired cadence.\nStability is derived through Lyapunov methods for switched systems, and\nexperimental results demonstrate the performance of the switched control system\nunder typical cycling conditions.\n",

        "summary": "  A barrier certificate can separate the state space of a con- sidered hybrid\nsystem (HS) into safe and unsafe parts ac- cording to the safety property to be\nverified. Therefore this notion has been widely used in the verification of\nHSs. A stronger condition on barrier certificates means that less expressive\nbarrier certificates can be synthesized. On the other hand, synthesizing more\nexpressive barrier certificates often means high complexity. In [9], Kong et al\nconsid- ered how to relax the condition of barrier certificates while still\nkeeping their convexity so that one can synthesize more expressive barrier\ncertificates efficiently using semi-definite programming (SDP). In this paper,\nwe first discuss how to relax the condition of barrier certificates in a\ngeneral way, while still keeping their convexity. Particularly, one can then\nutilize different weaker conditions flexibly to synthesize dif- ferent kinds of\nbarrier certificates with more expressiveness efficiently using SDP. These\nbarriers give more opportuni- ties to verify the considered system. We also\nshow how to combine two functions together to form a combined barrier\ncertificate in order to prove a safety property under consid- eration, whereas\nneither of them can be used as a barrier certificate separately, even according\nto any relaxed condi- tion. Another contribution of this paper is that we\ndiscuss how to discover certificates from the general relaxed condi- tion by\nSDP. In particular, we focus on how to avoid the unsoundness because of numeric\nerror caused by SDP with symbolic checking\n",

Therefore many solutions have been proposed to avoid collisions.\nThe main problem is to determine collision-free but also deadlock-free and\noptimal algorithms. Even with a simple definition of optimality, finding a\nglobal optimum is a problem of high complexity, especially for open systems\ninvolving a large and varying number of vehicles. This paper advocates the use\nof a mathematical framework based on a decomposition of the problem into a\ncontinuous optimization part and a scheduling problem. The paper emphasizes\nconnections between the usual notion of vehicle priority and an abstract\nformulation of the scheduling problem in the coordination space. A constructive\nlocally optimal algorithm is proposed. More generally, this work opens up for\nnew computationally efficient cooperative motion planning algorithms.\n",

Observer-based fault\ndetection systems, like control systems, yield invariant properties of\nquadratic types. These quadratic invariants express both safety properties of\nthe software such as the boundedness of the states and correctness properties\nsuch as the absence of false alarms from the fault detector. We seek to\nleverage these quadratic invariants, in an automated fashion, for the formal\nverification of the fault detection software. The approach, referred to as the\ncredible autocoding framework [1], can be characterized as autocoding with\nproofs. The process starts with the fault detector model, along with its safety\nand correctness properties, all expressed formally in a synchronous modeling\nenvironment such as Simulink. The model is then transformed by a prototype\ncredible autocoder into both code and analyzable annotations for the code. We\ndemonstrate the credible autocoding process on a running example of an output\nobserver fault detector for a 3-degrees-of-freedom (3DOF) helicopter control\nsystem.\n",

To facilitate\nthis study, the placement problem is addressed from the perspective of the\nelectrical structure which, unlike existing work on PMU placement, accounts for\nthe sensitivity between power injections and nodal phase angle differences\nbetween various buses in the power network. A linear dynamic model captures the\ntime evolution of system states, and a simple procedure is devised to estimate\nthe state transition function at each time instant. The placement problem is\nformulated as a series (time steps) of binary integer programs, with the goal\nto obtain the minimum number of PMUs at each time step for complete network\nobservability in the absence of zero injection measurements. Experiments are\nconducted on several standard IEEE test bus systems. The main thesis of this\nstudy is that, owing to the dynamic nature of the system states, for optimal\npower system operation the best one could do is to install a PMU on each bus of\nthe given network, though it is undesirable from an economic standpoint.\n",

Posynomial models are\nwidely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits,\naerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems\ncast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved\nefficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric\nprogramming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based\ndesign, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying\nposynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to\ndetermining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the\nexponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem\nnumerically hard. In this draft, we propose an approach to the identification\nof multivariate posynomial models, based on the expansion on a given\nlarge-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking\ncoefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a\nterm representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the\nrepresentation, which results in a problem formulation of the ``square-root\nLASSO'' type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables. We propose to\nsolve the problem via a sequential coordinate-descent scheme, which is suitable\nfor large-scale implementations.\n",

We\nconduct at-scale experiments in a newly constructed building on campus. By\nmodulating the supply duct static pressure (SDSP) for the main supply air duct,\nwe induce a response on the main supply fan and determine how much ancillary\npower flexibility can be provided by a typical commercial building. We show\nthat the consequent intermittent fluctuations in the air mass flow into the\nbuilding does not influence the building climate in a human-noticeable way. We\nestimate that at least 4 GW of regulation reserve is readily available only\nthrough commercial buildings in the US. Based on predictions this value will\nreach to 5.6 GW in 2035. We also show how thermal slack can be leveraged to\nprovide an ancillary service to deal with transient frequency fluctuations in\nthe grid. We consider a simplified model of the grid power system with time\nvarying demand and generation and present a simple control scheme to direct the\nancillary service power flow from buildings to improve on the classical\nautomatic generation control (AGC)-based approach. Simulation results are\nprovided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for enhancing\ngrid frequency regulation.\n",

        "summary": "  For a wireless sensor network (WSN) with a large number of low-cost,\nbattery-driven, multiple transmission power leveled sensor nodes of limited\ntransmission bandwidth, then conservation of transmission resources (power and\nbandwidth) is of paramount importance. Towards this end, this paper considers\nthe problem of power scheduling of Kalman filtering for general linear\nstochastic systems subject to data packet drops (over a packet-dropping\nwireless network). The transmission of the acquired measurement from the sensor\nto the remote estimator is realized by sequentially transmitting every single\ncomponent of the measurement to the remote estimator in one time period. The\nsensor node decides separately whether to use a high or low transmission power\nto communicate every component to the estimator across a packet-dropping\nwireless network based on the rule that promotes the power scheduling with the\nleast impact on the estimator mean squared error. Under the customary\nassumption that the predicted density is (approximately) Gaussian, leveraging\nthe statistical distribution of sensor data, the mechanism of power scheduling,\nthe wireless network effect and the received data, the minimum mean squared\nerror estimator is derived. By investigating the statistical convergence\nproperties of the estimation error covariance, we establish, for general linear\nsystems, both the sufficient condition and the necessary condition guaranteeing\nthe stability of the estimator.\n",

We assume that the underlying\ncommunication on any \\emph{link} suffers from \\emph{additive interference}\ncaused due to the communication by other agents following their own consensus\nprotocol. Additionally, no agent knows how many or which agents are interfering\nwith its communication. Clearly, the standard consensus protocol does not\nremain applicable in such scenarios. In this paper, we cast an algebraic\nstructure over the interference and show that the standard protocol can be\nmodified such that the average is reachable in a subspace whose dimension is\ncomplimentary to the maximal dimension of the interference subspaces (over all\nof the communication links). To develop the results, we use \\emph{information\nalignment} to align the intended transmission (over each link) to the\nnull-space of the interference (on that link). We show that this alignment is\nindeed invertible, i.e. the intended transmission can be recovered over which,\nsubsequently, consensus protocol is implemented. That \\emph{local} protocols\nexist even when the collection of the interference subspaces span the entire\nvector space is somewhat surprising.\n",

Aligning the\nstaffing levels to the forecasted workloads adaptively in such systems is\nnontrivial because of a large number of parameters and operational variations\nleading to a huge search space. A challenging problem here is to optimize the\nstaffing while maintaining the system in steady-state and compliant to\naggregate service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Further, because these\nparameters change on a weekly basis, the optimization should not take longer\nthan a few hours. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov cost\nprocess parameterized by the (discrete) staffing levels. We propose novel\nsimultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) based SASOC (Staff\nAllocation using Stochastic Optimization with Constraints) algorithms for\nsolving the above problem. The algorithms include both first order as well as\nsecond order methods and incorporate SPSA based gradient estimates in the\nprimal, with dual ascent for the Lagrange multipliers. Both the algorithms that\nwe propose are online, incremental and easy to implement. Further, they involve\na certain generalized smooth projection operator, which is essential to project\nthe continuous-valued worker parameter tuned by SASOC algorithms onto the\ndiscrete set. We validated our algorithms on five real-life service systems and\ncompared them with a state-of-the-art optimization tool-kit OptQuest.

However, this approach inherently\nassumes that the energy source has an unbounded capacity, which is not always\nrealistic. For example, an autonomous robotic device has a battery of finite\ncapacity that has to be recharged periodically, and the total amount of energy\nconsumed between two successive charging cycles is bounded by the capacity.\nHence, a controller minimizing the mean-payoff must obey this restriction. In\nthis paper we study the controller synthesis problem for consumption systems\nwith a finite battery capacity, where the task of the controller is to minimize\nthe mean-payoff while preserving the functionality of the system encoded by a\ngiven linear-time property. We show that an optimal controller always exists,\nand it may either need only finite memory or require infinite memory (it is\ndecidable in polynomial time which of the two cases holds). Further, we show\nhow to compute an effective description of an optimal controller in polynomial\ntime. Finally, we consider the limit values achievable by larger and larger\nbattery capacity, show that these values are computable in polynomial time, and\nwe also analyze the corresponding rate of convergence.

        "summary": "  The conventional approach for the control of distribution networks, in the\npresence of active generation and/or controllable loads and storage, involves a\ncombination of both frequency and voltage regulation at different time scales.\nWith the increased penetration of stochastic resources, distributed generation\nand demand response, this approach shows severe limitations in both the optimal\nand feasible operation of these networks, as well as in the aggregation of the\nnetwork resources for upper-layer power systems. An alternative approach is to\ndirectly control the targeted grid by defining explicit and real-time setpoints\nfor active/reactive power absorptions/injections defined by a solution of a\nspecific optimization problem; but this quickly becomes intractable when\nsystems get large or diverse. In this paper, we address this problem and\npropose a method for the explicit control of the grid status, based on a common\nabstract model characterized by the main property of being composable. That is\nto say, subsystems can be aggregated into virtual devices that hide their\ninternal complexity. Thus the proposed method can easily cope with systems of\nany size or complexity. The framework is presented in this Part I, whilst in\nPart II we illustrate its application to a CIGR\\'E low voltage benchmark\nmicrogrid. In particular, we provide implementation examples with respect to\ntypical devices connected to distribution networks and evaluate of the\nperformance and benefits of the proposed control framework.\n",

The missing data is shown to play an identical role to\nthe selection of an ordered distribution in the same ordered family in the set\nJPDA algorithm.

In this context, we investigate whether it is possible to\nsynthesize a stabilizing event-triggered feedback law for networked control\nsystems (NCS) which have two time-scales, based only on an approximate model of\nthe slow dynamics. We follow an emulation-like approach as we assume that we\nknow how to solve the problem in the absence of sampling and then we study how\nto design the event-triggering rule under communication constraints. The NCS is\nmodeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed system which exhibits the feature to\ngenerate jumps for both the fast variable and the error variable induced by the\nsampling. The first conclusion is that a triggering law which guarantees the\nstability and the existence of a uniform minimum amount of time between two\ntransmissions for the slow model may not ensure the existence of such a time\nfor the overall system, which makes the controller not implementable in\npractice. The objective of this contribution is twofold. We first show that\nexisting event-triggering conditions can be adapted to singularly perturbed\nsystems and semiglobal practical stability can be ensured in this case. Second,\nwe propose another technique that combines event-triggered and time-triggered\nresults in the sense that transmissions are only allowed after a predefined\namount of time has elapsed since the last transmission. This technique has the\nadvantage, under an additional assumption, to ensure a global asymptotic\nstability property and to allow the user to directly tune the minimum\ninter-transmission interval. We believe that this technique is of its own\ninterest independently of the two-time scale nature of the addressed problem.\nThe results are shown to be applicable to a class of globally Lipschitz\nsystems.\n",

Most\nprior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the induced L2\nnorm. The conditions for upper bounds are typically based on scaled small-gain\ntheorems with dynamic multipliers or dissipation inequalities with parameter\ndependent Lyapunov functions. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to\ncompute lower bounds for the induced L2 norm. The proposed approach computes a\nlower bound on the gain by restricting the parameter trajectory to be a\nperiodic signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact\ncalculation of the L2 norm for a periodic linear time varying system. The\nproposed lower bound algorithm has two benefits. First, the lower bound\ncomplements standard upper bound techniques. Specifically, a small gap between\nthe bounds indicates that further computation, e.g. upper bounds with more\ncomplex Lyapunov functions, is unnecessary. Second, the lower bound algorithm\nreturns a bad parameter trajectory for the LPV system that can be further\nanalyzed to provide insight into the system performance.\n",

        "summary": "  Phase-locked loops (PLL), Costas loops and other synchronizing circuits are\nfeatured by the presence of a nonlinear phase detector, described by a periodic\nnonlinearity. In general, nonlinearities can cause complex behavior of the\nsystem such multi-stability and chaos. However, even phase locking may be\nguaranteed under any initial conditions, the transient behavior of the circuit\ncan be unsatisfactory due to the cycle slipping. Growth of the phase error\ncaused by cycle slipping is undesirable, leading e.g. to demodulation and\ndecoding errors. This makes the problem of estimating the phase error\noscillations and number of slipped cycles in nonlinear PLL-based circuits\nextremely important for modern telecommunications. Most mathematical results in\nthis direction, available in the literature, examine the probability density of\nthe phase error and expected number of slipped cycles under stochastic noise in\nthe signal. At the same time, cycle slipping occurs also in deterministic\nsystems with periodic nonlinearities, depending on the initial conditions,\nproperties of the linear part and the periodic nonlinearity and other factors\nsuch as delays in the loop. In the present paper we give analytic estimates for\nthe number of slipped cycles in PLL-based systems, governed by\nintegro-differential equations, allowing to capture effects of high-order\ndynamics, discrete and distributed delays. We also consider the effects of\nsingular small parameter perturbations on the cycle slipping behavior.\n",

In order to drive all followers into the convex hull\nspanned by the leaders, a $PI^n$-type ($P$ and $I$ are short for {\\it\nProportion} and {\\it Integration}, respectively; $I^n$ implies that the\nalgorithm includes high-order integral terms) containment algorithm is\nproposed. It is theoretically proved that the $PI^n$-type containment algorithm\nis able to solve the containment problem of multi-agent systems where the\nfollowers are described by any order integral dynamics.

Such a complex\nprocedure of sensing and stimulation calls for direct communication among these\nsensors and actuators. In addition, minimizing the sensor/actuator to the size\nof a biological cell can enable the cell-level automatic therapy. For this\nobjective, we propose such an approach to form a peer-to-peer network of\n\\emph{in vivo} sensors/actuators (S/As) that can be deployed with or even\ninside biological cells. The S/As can communicate with each other via\nelectromagnetic waves of optical frequencies. In comparison with the comparable\ntechniques including the radio-frequency identification (RFID) and the wireless\nsensor network (WSN), this technique is well adapted for the cell-level\nsensing-actuating tasks considering the requirements on size, actuation speed,\nsignal-collision avoidance, etc.\n",

However such models are difficult to analyze. To address this, we\ndevelop a probabilistic analysis method by approximating the mode transitions\nas stochastic events. We assume that the probability of making a mode\ntransition is proportional to the measure of the set of pairs of time points\nand value states at which the mode transition is enabled. To ensure a sound\nmathematical basis, we impose a natural continuity property on the non-linear\nODEs. We also assume that the states of the system are observed at discrete\ntime points but that the mode transitions may take place at any time between\ntwo successive discrete time points. This leads to a discrete time Markov chain\nas a probabilistic approximation of the hybrid system. We then show that for\nBLTL (bounded linear time temporal logic) specifications the hybrid system\nmeets a specification iff its Markov chain approximation meets the same\nspecification with probability $1$. Based on this, we formulate a sequential\nhypothesis testing procedure for verifying -approximately- that the Markov\nchain meets a BLTL specification with high probability.

This paper\npresents a combinatorial rigidity approach to measure (i) generic rigidity and\n(ii) generalized redundant rigidity properties of graph structures through\ngraph invariants for the localization problem in wireless sensor networks. We\ndefine the rigidity index as a graph invariant based on independent set of\nedges in the rigidity matroid. It has a value between 0 and 1, and it indicates\nhow close we are to rigidity. Redundant rigidity is required for global\nrigidity, which is associated with unique realization of graphs. Moreover,\nredundant rigidity also provides rigidity robustness in networked systems\nagainst structural changes, such as link losses. Here, we give a broader\ndefinition of redundant edge that we call the \"generalized redundant edge.\"\nThis definition of redundancy is valid for both rigid and non-rigid graphs.\nNext, we define the redundancy index as a graph invariant based on generalized\nredundant edges in the rigidity matroid. It also has a value between 0 and 1,\nand it indicates the percentage of redundancy in a graph. These two indices\nallow us to explore the transition from non-rigidity to rigidity and the\ntransition from rigidity to redundant rigidity. Examples on graphs are provided\nto demonstrate this approach. From a sensor network point of view, these two\nindices enable us to evaluate the effects of sensing radii of sensors on the\nrigidity properties of networks, which in turn, allow us to examine the\nlocalizability of sensor networks.

The MRC-WPT system with\na single pair of transmitter and receiver has been extensively studied in the\nliterature, while there is limited work on the general setup with multiple\ntransmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a point-to-multipoint\nMRC-WPT system with one transmitter sending power wirelessly to a set of\ndistributed receivers simultaneously. We derive the power delivered to the load\nof each receiver in closed-form expression, and reveal a \"near-far\" fairness\nissue in multiuser power transmission due to users' distance-dependent mutual\ninductances with the transmitter. We also show that by designing the receivers'\nload resistances, the near-far issue can be optimally solved. Specifically, we\npropose a centralized algorithm to jointly optimize the load resistances to\nminimize the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter under given\npower requirements for the loads. We also devise a distributed algorithm for\nthe receivers to adjust their load resistances iteratively, for ease of\npractical implementation.\n",

Based on the simulation results, we\nrecommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable\nthermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with\nsimilar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple\npower throttling states, customer engagement plans with less temperature\ndeviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical\nON/OFF control, higher temperature deviations are required to achieve similar\namount of peak load reduction. Several other interesting tradeoffs and useful\nguidelines for designing mutually beneficial incentives for both the grid\noperator and customers can also be identified.\n",

Motivated by this limitation, we first propose a receding horizon fault\nestimator parameterized by predictor Markov parameters. This estimator provides\n(asymptotically) unbiased fault estimates as long as the subsystem from faults\nto outputs has no unstable transmission zeros. When the identified Markov\nparameters are used to construct the above fault estimator, zero-mean\nstochastic identification errors appear as model uncertainty multiplied with\nunknown fault signals and online system inputs/outputs (I/O). Based on this\nfault estimation error analysis, we formulate a mixed-norm problem for the\noffline robust design that regards online I/O data as unknown. An alternative\nonline mixed-norm problem is also proposed that can further reduce estimation\nerrors when the online I/O data have large amplitudes, at the cost of increased\ncomputational burden. Based on a geometrical interpretation of the two proposed\nmixed-norm problems, systematic methods to tune the user-defined parameters\ntherein are given to achieve desired performance trade-offs.

As an extension of the LMS\nalgorithm which is the most widely-used adaptive filtering technique, the LLMS\nalgorithm has been proposed for decades, due to the deteriorated performance of\nthe standard LMS algorithm with highly correlated input. However, both ofthem\ndo not consider the sparsity information to have better behaviors. As a\nsparse-aware modification of the LLMS, our proposed Lplike-LLMS algorithm,\nincorporates a p-norm-like penalty into the cost function of the LLMS to obtain\na shrinkage in the weight update, which then enhances the performance in sparse\nsystem identification settings. The simulation results show that the proposed\nalgorithm improves the performance of the filter in sparse system settings in\nthe presence of noisy input signals.\n",

This timing model allows multiple\ncontrollers to share a CAN without significant degradation in the controller\nperformance. The timing model also provides a convenient way to check the\nschedulability of messages on the CAN at runtime. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the timing model is accurate and computationally efficient to\nmeet the needs of real-time implementation.

A network of wireless sensors with limited computation capability\nmonitors the environment and sends observations to a fusion center via wireless\nchannels.

The objective is to detect the change\nat the fusion center as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on false\ndetection and average communication rate between the sensors and the fusion\ncenter. A minimax formulation is proposed. The cumulative sum (CuSum) algorithm\nis used at the fusion center and censoring strategies are used at the sensor\nnodes. The censoring strategies, which are adaptive to the CuSum statistic, are\nfed back by the fusion center. The sensors only send observations that fall\ninto prescribed sets to the fusion center. This CuSum adaptive censoring\n(CuSum-AC) algorithm is proved to be an equalizer rule and to be globally\nasymptotically optimal for any positive communication rate constraint, as the\naverage run length to false alarm goes to infinity. It is also shown, by\nnumerical examples, that the CuSum-AC algorithm provides a suitable trade-off\nbetween the detection performance and the communication rate.\n",

The three types of consensus are shown to be simultaneously\nachieved over an independent or a Markovian random network defined on an\nunderlying graph with a directed spanning tree.

Due to the non-linear nature of the AC\npower-flow equations, the OPF problem is known to be non-convex, therefore hard\nto solve. Most proposed methods for solving the OPF rely on approximations that\nrender the problem convex, but that may yield inexact solutions. Recently,\nFarivar and Low proposed a method that is claimed to be exact for radial\ndistribution systems, despite no apparent approximations. In our work, we show\nthat it is, in fact, not exact. On one hand, there is a misinterpretation of\nthe physical network model related to the ampacity constraint of the lines'\ncurrent flows. On the other hand, the proof of the exactness of the proposed\nrelaxation requires unrealistic assumptions related to the unboundedness of\nspecific control variables. We also show that the extension of this approach to\naccount for exact line models might provide physically infeasible solutions.\nRecently, several contributions have proposed OPF algorithms that rely on the\nuse of the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, as we\nshow in this work, there are cases for which the ADMM-based solution of the\nnon-relaxed OPF problem fails to converge. To overcome the aforementioned\nlimitations, we propose an algorithm for the solution of a non-approximated,\nnon-convex OPF problem in radial distribution systems that is based on the\nmethod of multipliers, and on a primal decomposition of the OPF. This work is\ndivided in two parts. In Part I, we specifically discuss the limitations of BFM\nand ADMM to solve the OPF problem. In Part II, we provide a centralized version\nand a distributed asynchronous version of the proposed OPF algorithm and we\nevaluate its performances using both small-scale electrical networks, as well\nas a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder.\n",

We propose a probabilistic method for synthesizing an optimal\ncontrol policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a specification\nbased on a discrete approximation of the underlying stochastic system. First,\nwe show that the original problem can be formulated as a stochastic optimal\ncontrol problem in a state space augmented with finite memory and states of\nsome clock variables. Second, we present a numerical method for computing an\noptimal policy with which the given specification is satisfied with the maximal\nprobability in point-based semantics in the discrete approximation of the\nunderlying system. We show that the policy obtained in the discrete\napproximation converges to the optimal one for satisfying the specification in\nthe continuous or dense-time semantics as the discretization becomes finer in\nboth state and time. Finally, we illustrate our approach with a robotic motion\nplanning example.\n",

As a result, UAV traffic management systems are needed to\nsupport potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the airspace, in\norder to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met. Hamilton-Jacobi\n(HJ) reachability is a powerful framework for providing conditions under which\nthese requirements can be met, and for synthesizing the optimal controller for\nmeeting them. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, HJ reachability is\nonly tractable for a small number of vehicles if their set of maneuvers is\nunrestricted. In this paper, we define a platoon to be a group of UAVs in a\nsingle-file formation. We model each vehicle as a hybrid system with modes\ncorresponding to its role in the platoon, and specify the set of allowed\nmaneuvers in each mode to make the analysis tractable. We propose several\nliveness controllers based on HJ reachability, and wrap a safety controller,\nalso based on HJ reachability, around the liveness controllers. For a single\naltitude range, our approach guarantees safety for one safety breach; in the\nunlikely event of multiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed over\nmultiple altitude ranges. We demonstrate the satisfaction of liveness and\nsafety requirements through simulations of three common scenarios.\n",

This can be seen as a blind identification problem.\nFor benchmarking purposes, we present two different identification approaches:\na baseline overparametrization method and a kernel-based method.\n",

Since the impulse response model is a\nspecial case of orthonormal basis functions, it is interesting to consider if\nit is possible to tackle the regularized system identification using more\ncompact orthonormal basis functions. In this paper, we explore two\npossibilities. First, we construct reproducing kernel Hilbert space of impulse\nresponses by orthonormal basis functions and then use the induced reproducing\nkernel for the regularized impulse response estimation. Second, we extend the\nregularization method from impulse response estimation to the more general\northonormal basis functions estimation. For both cases, the poles of the basis\nfunctions are treated as hyperparameters and estimated by empirical Bayes\nmethod. Then we further show that the former is a special case of the latter,\nand more specifically, the former is equivalent to ridge regression of the\ncoefficients of the orthonormal basis functions.\n",

Thus, most distribution\nmanagement systems (DMS) include a single-phase state estimator. Due to\nnon-convexity of the SE problem, heuristic and Newton methods do not guarantee\nthe global solution. In contrast, SDP based SE is more promising to guarantee\nthe globally optimal solution since it represents and solves the problem in a\nconvex format. However, the observability of the power system is highly\nvulnerable to the set of measurements while employing the SDP-based SE, which\nis addressed in this report. An algorithm is proposed to generate additional\nmeasurements using the measurement data already gathered. The SDP-based SE is\nvery sensitive to the level of noise in large power networks. Also, bad data\ndetection algorithms proposed for Newton methods do not work for the SDP-based\nSE method due to larger number of state variables in SDP representation of\npower network. In this report, an algorithm is proposed to generate additional\nmeasurements using the measurement data already gathered in order to solve the\nobservability issue. A network separation algorithm is developed to solve the\nentire problem for smaller sub-networks which include micro-PMUs to mitigate\nthe adverse effects of noise for huge networks.

The first part\naddresses wind power dispatch into the electricity network using a battery\nenergy storage system (BESS). To manage the amount of energy sold to the\nelectricity market, a novel control scheme is developed based on discrete-time\nmodel predictive control (MPC) to ensure the optimal operation of the BESS in\nthe presence of practical constraints. The control scheme follows a decision\npolicy to sell more energy at peak demand times and store it at off-peaks in\ncompliance with the Australian National Electricity Market rules. The\nperformance of the control system is assessed under different scenarios using\nactual wind farm and electricity price data in simulation environment. The\nsecond part considers the control of overhead crane systems for automatic\noperation. To achieve high-speed load transportation with high-precision and\nminimum load swings, a new modeling approach is developed based on independent\njoint control strategy which considers actuators as the main plant. The\nnonlinearities of overhead crane dynamics are treated as disturbances acting on\neach actuator. The resulting model enables us to estimate the unknown\nparameters of the system including coulomb friction constants. A novel load\nswing control is also designed based on passivity-based control to suppress\nload swings. Two discrete-time controllers are then developed based on MPC and\nstate feedback control to track reference trajectories along with a feedforward\ncontrol to compensate for disturbances using computed torque control and a\nnovel disturbance observer. The practical results on an experimental overhead\ncrane setup demonstrate the high performance of the designed control systems.\n",

Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid,\nit requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures,\ncyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric grid\ncommunity, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition of\ncyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resilience\nfor the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience.\nThis paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physical\nresilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a new\nway of thinking about grid operation with unexpected disturbances and hazards\nand leveraging distributed energy resources.\n",

This paper introduces a dynamic model for multiple\naperiodic tasks on a SPSB system under a scheduling algorithm that resembles\nthe rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) within finite time windows. The model\ncontains two major modules. The first module is an online battery capacity\nmodel based on the Rakhmatov-Vrudhula-Wallach (RVW) model. This module provides\npredictions of remaining battery capacity based on the knowledge of the battery\ndischarging current. The second module is a dynamical scheduling model that can\npredict the scheduled behavior of tasks within any finite time window, without\nthe need to store all past information about each task before the starting time\nof the finite time window. The module provides a complete analytical\ndescription of the relationship among tasks and it delineates all possible\nmodes of the processor utilization as square-wave functions of time. The two\nmodules i.e. the scheduling model and the battery model are integrated to\nobtain a hybrid scheduling model that describes the dynamic behaviors of the\nSPSB system.

In this paper, we consider a\npoint-to-multipoint MRC-WPT system with one transmitter delivering wireless\npower to a set of distributed receivers. We aim to introduce new applications\nof signal processing and optimization techniques to the performance\ncharacterization and optimization in multiuser WPT via MRC. We first derive\nclosed-form expressions for the power drawn from the energy source at the\ntransmitter and that delivered to the load at each receiver. We identify a\n\"near-far\" fairness issue in multiuser power transmission due to receivers'\ndistance-dependent mutual inductance with the transmitter. To tackle this\nissue, we propose a centralized charging control algorithm to jointly optimize\nthe receivers' load resistance to minimize the total transmitter power drawn\nwhile meeting the given power requirement of each individual load. For ease of\npractical implementation, we also devise a distributed algorithm for the\nreceivers to adjust their load resistance independently in an iterative manner.\nLast, we characterize the power region that constitutes all the achievable\npower-tuples of the loads via controlling their adjustable resistance. In\nparticular, we compare the power regions without versus with the time sharing\nof users' power transmission, where it is shown that time sharing yields a\nlarger power region in general.

However, due to the large mass and limited engine power of HDVs,\nslopes have a significant impact on the feasible and optimal speed profiles\nthat each vehicle can and should follow. Therefore maintaining a short\ninter-vehicular distance as required by platooning without coordination between\nvehicles can often result in inefficient or even unfeasible trajectories. In\nthis paper we propose a two-layer control architecture for HDV platooning aimed\nto safely and fuel-efficiently coordinate the vehicles in the platoon. Here,\nthe layers are responsible for the inclusion of preview information on road\ntopography and the real-time control of the vehicles, respectively. Within this\narchitecture, dynamic programming is used to compute the fuel-optimal speed\nprofile for the entire platoon and a distributed model predictive control\nframework is developed for the real-time control of the vehicles. The\neffectiveness of the proposed controller is analyzed by means of simulations of\nseveral realistic scenarios that suggest a possible fuel saving of up to 12%\nfor the follower vehicles compared to the use of standard platoon controllers.\n",

The proposed model combines these partial\nmodels into a single unified cost optimization model. Therefore, it is able to\nanalyze scenarios which are closer to practical implementation. Furthermore, it\nis useful to analyze the behavior of a population (e.g., smart buildings, smart\ncities, etc.) and properties of the components for specific scenarios (e.g.,\nthe impact of aggregate storage capacity, etc.).

It has been studied extensively due to its immense practical\nimportance in a variety of fields. The underlying goal is to identify the\nimpulse response of an unknown system. This is accomplished by placing a known\nsystem in parallel and feeding both systems with the same input. Due to initial\ndisparity in their impulse responses, an error is generated between their\noutputs. This error is set to tune the impulse response of known system in a\nway that every change in impulse response reduces the magnitude of prospective\nerror. This process is repeated until the error becomes negligible and the\nresponses of both systems match. To specifically minimize the error, numerous\nadaptive algorithms are available. They are noteworthy either for their low\ncomputational complexity or high convergence speed.

We show that\nit is possible to address this problem by relying on a system-inversion-based\nfault estimation filter that is parameterized using identified Markov\nparameters. Our novel data-driven approach improves estimation performance by\navoiding the propagation of model reduction errors originating from\nidentification of the state-space plant model into the designed filter.\nFurthermore, it allows additional design freedom to stabilize the obtained\nfilter under the same stabilizability condition as the existing model-based\nsystem inversion.

The\nscheme is based on multiple hybrid Kalman filters (HKF) which represents an\nintegration of a nonlinear mathematical model of the system with a number of\npiecewise linear (PWL) models. The proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI)\nscheme is capable of detecting and isolating sensor faults during the entire\noperational regime of the system by interpolating the PWL models using a\nBayesian approach. Moreover, the proposed multiple HKF-based FDI scheme is\nextended to identify the magnitude of a sensor fault by using a modified\ngeneralized likelihood ratio (GLR) method which relies on the healthy\noperational mode of the system. To illustrate the capabilities of our proposed\nFDII methodology, extensive simulation studies are conducted for a nonlinear\ngas turbine engine. Various single and concurrent sensor fault scenarios are\nconsidered to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed on-line\nhierarchical multiple HKF-based FDII scheme under different flight modes.\nFinally, our proposed HKF-based FDI approach is compared with various filtering\nmethods such as the linear, extended, unscented and cubature Kalman filters\n(LKF, EKF, UKF and CKF, respectively) corresponding to both interacting and\nnon-interacting multiple model (MM) based schemes. Our comparative studies\nconfirm the superiority of our proposed HKF method in terms of promptness of\nthe fault detection, lower false alarm rates, as well as robustness with\nrespect to the engine health parameters degradations.\n",

Using steady state IEEE benchmark data sets, we explore\nexperimentally that already a small number of controllers placed at certain\ngrid buses suffices to achieve globally optimal power flows.

The inverse of the transformation must have\nnonzero eigenvalues with both positive and negative real parts which may lead\nthe system to instability. If the inverse of the transformation appears in\nclosed loop then a diagonal stabilizing matrix is required to reassign the\neigenvalues of the inverse of transformation in the right half of complex\nplane.

This is accomplished by generalizing the\nbasic invariant subspaces including unobservable, conditioned invariant and\nunobservability subspaces of 1D systems to 2D models. These extensions have\nbeen achieved and facilitated by representing a 2D model as an infinite\ndimensional (Inf-D) system on a Banach vector space, and by particularly\nconstructing algorithms that compute these subspaces in a \\emph{finite and\nknown} number of steps. By utilizing the introduced subspaces the FDI problem\nis formulated and necessary and sufficient conditions for its solvability are\nprovided. Sufficient conditions for solvability of the FDI problem for 2D\nsystems using both deadbeat and LMI filters are also developed. Moreover, the\ncapabilities and advantages of our proposed approach are demonstrated by\nperforming an analytical comparison with the currently available 2D geometric\nmethods in the literature.

A system able to promptly detect falls would help in reducing\nthe injuries that a fall could cause. Such a system should meet the needs of\nthe people to which is designed, so that it is actually used. In particular,\nthe system should be minimally invasive and inexpensive. Thanks to the fact\nthat most of the smartphones embed accelerometers and powerful processing unit,\nthey are good candidates both as data acquisition devices and as platforms to\nhost fall detection systems. For this reason, in the last years several fall\ndetection methods have been experimented on smartphone accelerometer data. Most\nof them have been tuned with simulated falls because, to date, datasets of\nreal-world falls are not available. This article evaluates the effectiveness of\nmethods that detect falls as anomalies. To this end, we compared traditional\napproaches with anomaly detectors. In particular, we experienced the kNN and\nthe SVM methods using both the one-class and two-classes configurations. The\ncomparison involved three different collections of accelerometer data, and four\ndifferent data representations. Empirical results demonstrated that, in most of\nthe cases, falls are not required to design an effective fall detector.\n",

In this paper, we review how modern information and communication\ntechnology supports a cyber-physical transportation system architecture with an\nintegrated logistic system coordinating fleets of trucks traveling together in\nvehicle platoons. From the reduced air drag, platooning trucks traveling close\ntogether can save about 10% of their fuel consumption.

By optimizing the interaction between vehicles and platoons\nof vehicles, it is shown that significant improvements can be achieved.

A realistic case study with 200 heavy-duty vehicles performing\ntransportation tasks in Sweden is described.

Gas-fired generators have the capability to ramp quickly and\nare often utilized by grid operators to balance intermittency caused by wind\ngeneration. The time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying\nnatural gas consumption rates that impact the pressure and line-pack of the gas\nnetwork. As gas system operators assume nearly constant gas consumption when\nestimating pipeline transfer capacity and for planning operations, such\nfluctuations are a source of risk to their system. Here, we develop a new\nmethod to assess this risk. We consider a model of gas networks with\nconsumption modeled through two components: forecasted consumption and small\nspatio-temporarily varying consumption due to the gas-fired generators being\nused to balance wind. While the forecasted consumption is globally balanced\nover longer time scales, the fluctuating consumption causes pressure\nfluctuations in the gas system to grow diffusively in time with a diffusion\nrate sensitive to the steady but spatially-inhomogeneous forecasted\ndistribution of mass flow.

We\nprovide theoretical conditions ensuring the estimation convergence.\nReconfigurability of the proposed estimation scheme is allowed in case of plug\nand play operations. Simulation tests are provided to illustrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n",

Under heavy\nloads and large joint torques the hysteresis lost motion can lead to\nsignificant errors of tracking and positioning of the robotic links. In this\npaper, two approaches for compensating the nonlinear joint torsion with\nhysteresis are described and compared with each other. Both methods assume the\nmeasured signals available only on the motor side of joint transmissions. The\nfirst approach assumes a rigid-link manipulator model and transforms the\ndesired link trajectory into that of the motor drives by using the inverse\ndynamics and inverse hysteresis map. The second approach relies on the modeling\nof motor drives and inverse hysteresis and uses the generalized momenta when\npredicting the joint torsion. Both methods are discussed in details along with\na numerical example of two-link planar manipulator under gravity.\n",

Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally\nfriendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium,\n2) conservative, and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium\nand conservative EVs are considered to be interested only in charging their\nbatteries, with noticeably higher rate of charging for premium EVs. Green\nvehicles are more environmentally friendly, and thus assist the CS to reduce\nits cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as\ndistributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of\nEV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed\ninteger programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed\nclassification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be\neffectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy\ntrading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data\nare used for performance analysis of the system. It is demonstrated that the\ntotal cost to the CS reduces considerably as the percentage of green vehicles\nincreases, and also that the contributions of green EVs in winter are greater\nthan those in summer.\n",

The quadratic objective\nfunction is the deviation of the decision variables from their measured values.\nThe solution to the QP gives estimates of all unmeasured variables and thus\nyields a fully specified simulation model. Runs of this simulation model can\nthen be compared with other field measurements, such as travel times along\nroutes, to judge the reliability of the calibrated model. A section of the\nHuntington-Colorado arterial near I-210 in Los Angeles comprising 73 links and\n16 intersections is used to illustrate the procedure. Two experiments are\nconducted with the calibrated model to determine the maximum traffic that can\nbe diverted from the I-210 freeway to the arterial network, with and without\npermitting changes in the timing plans. The maximum diversion in both cases is\nobtained by solving a linear programming problem. A third experiment compares\nthe delay and travel time using the existing fixed time control and a max\npressure control. The fourth experiment compares two PointQ models: in the\nfirst model the freeway traffic follows a pre-specified route while the\nbackground traffic moves according to turn ratios, and in the second model turn\nratios are modified in a single commodity model to match the link flows. The\nsubstantial modification of the turn ratios needed suggests that the use of a\nsingle-commodity model as frequently done in CTM models can be misleading...\n",

Slow response times and long energy\nmanagement periods cannot efficiently integrate intermittent renewable\ngeneration and demand.

Voltage magnitudes for\ninstance can transiently exceed regulation limits, while smart inverters can be\noverloaded over short time intervals.

In the context of complex networks, bilinear systems capture scenarios\nwhere an actuator not only can affect the state of a node but also\ninterconnections among nodes. Under the assumption that the input's infinity\nnorm is bounded by some function of the network dynamic matrices, we derive a\nGramian-based lower bound on the minimum input energy required to steer the\nstate from the origin to any reachable target state. This result motivates our\nstudy of various objects associated to the reachability Gramian to quantify the\nease of controllability of the bilinear network: the minimum eigenvalue\n(worst-case minimum input energy to reach a state), the trace (average minimum\ninput energy to reach a state), and its determinant (volume of the ellipsoid\ncontaining the reachable states using control inputs with no more than unit\nenergy). We establish an increasing returns property of the reachability\nGramian as a function of the actuators, which in turn allows us to derive a\ngeneral lower bound on the reachability metrics in terms of the aggregate\ncontribution of the individual actuators. We conclude by examining the effect\non the worst-case minimum input energy of the addition of bilinear inputs to\ndifficult-to-control linear symmetric networks. We show that the bilinear\nnetworks resulting from the addition of either inputs at a finite number of\ninterconnections or at all self loops with weight vanishing with the network\nscale remain difficult-to-control.

To optimize HVAC energy usage,\nit is important to understand the energy consumption of individual HVAC\ncomponents at fine granularities. However, buildings typically only have\naggregate building level power and thermal meters. We present HVACMeter, a\nsystem which leverages existing sensors in commercial HVAC systems to estimate\nthe energy consumed by individual components of the HVAC system, as well by\neach thermal zone in buildings. HVACMeter can be generalized to any HVAC system\nas it uses the basic understanding of HVAC operation, heat transfer equations,\nand historical sensor data to estimate energy. We deploy HVACMeter to three\nbuildings on our campus, to identify the set of sensors that are important for\naccurately disaggregating energy use at the level of each Air Handler Unit and\neach thermal zone within these buildings. HVACMeter power estimations have on\nan average 44.5 % less RMSE than that of mean power estimates.

In the resulting local controllers, only observable events can\ncause state change. Further, to deal with large-scale systems, we combine the\npartial-observation supervisor localization with an efficient architectural\nsynthesis approach: first compute a heterarchical array of partial-observation\ndecentralized supervisors and coordinators, and then localize each of these\nsupervisors/coordinators into local controllers.\n",

Focus of this paper is on optimizing the convergence rate\nof the continuous time quantum consensus algorithm over a quantum network with\n$N$ qudits. It is shown that the optimal convergence rate is independent of the\nvalue of $d$ in qudits. First by classifying the induced graphs as the Schreier\ngraphs, they are categorized in terms of the partitions of integer $N$. Then\nestablishing the intertwining relation between one level dominant partitions in\nthe Hasse Diagram of integer $N$, it is proved that the spectrum of the induced\ngraph corresponding to the dominant partition is included in that of the less\ndominant partition. Based on this result, the proof of the Aldous' conjecture\nis extended to all possible induced graphs and the original optimization\nproblem is reduced to optimizing spectral gap of the smallest induced graph. By\nproviding the analytical solution to semidefinite programming formulation of\nthe obtained problem, closed-form expressions for the optimal results are\nprovided for a wide range of topologies.\n",

A promising class of potential demand\nresponse providers includes energy storage systems (ESSs). This paper evaluates\nthe benefits of using various types of novel ESS technologies for a variety of\nemerging smart grid demand response programs, such as regulation services\nreserves (RSRs), contingency reserves, and peak shaving. We model, formulate\nand solve optimization problems to maximize the net profit of ESSs in providing\neach demand response. Our solution selects the optimal power and energy\ncapacities of the ESS, determines the optimal reserve value to provide as well\nas the ESS real-time operational policy for program participation. Our results\nhighlight that applying ultra-capacitors and flywheels in RSR has the potential\nto be up to 30 times more profitable than using common battery technologies\nsuch as LI and LA batteries for peak shaving.\n",

At each discrete\ntime instant, which may represent a 15 minute interval, each agent may\nconsume/generate some quantity of electrical energy. The Independent System\nOperator (ISO) is given the task of assigning consumptions/generations to the\nagents so as to maximize the sum of the utilities accrued to the agents,\nsubject to the constraint that energy generation equals consumption at each\ntime.\n  This task of coordinating generation and demand has to be accomplished by the\nISO without the agents revealing their system states, dynamics, or utility/cost\nfunctions. We show how and when a simple iterative procedure converges to the\noptimal solution. The ISO iteratively obtains electricity bids by the agents,\nand declares the tentative market clearing prices. In response to these prices,\nthe agents submit new bids.\n  On the demand side, the solution yields an optimal demand response for\ndynamic and stochastic loads. On the generation side, it provides the optimal\nutilization of stochastically varying renewables such as solar/wind, and\ngeneration with fossil fuel based generation with dynamic constraints such as\nramping rates. Thereby we solve a decentralized stochastic control problem,\nwithout agents sharing any information about their system models, states or\nutility functions.\n",

Traditional approaches such as proportional controller and\nconventional PID (CPID) controller are widely used. PID controller has a good\nstatic performance especially for linear and time-invariant systems, but a weak\ndynamic performance and discouraging function on nonlinear, time-varying, and\nuncertain systems. Fuzzy control theory can improve dynamic response in various\nconditions of system performance. This paper designs fuzzy self-tuning PID\n(FSPID) controller to improve disadvantages of conventional PID in aircraft\nautopilots. We apply proposed controller to pitch angle of aircraft then the\nabilities of proposed controller will be compared to the conventional PID and\nproportional controller. Inner feedback loop acts as oscillation damper in\ntraditional schemes, but here is removed to compare the capabilities of Fuzzy\nself-tuning PID, conventional PID, and proportional controller. Based on the\nsimulations, both of Conventional and Fuzzy self-tuning PID controllers can\nproperly damp oscillations in lack of the inner feedback loop, but proportional\ncontroller cannot do. Then short-period approximation is assumed to assess the\nfunction of FSPID and CPID controllers in confront with abrupt and continuous\ndisturbances, in addition to inappropriate tuning of parameters. Simulation\nresults of short-period approximation show a better anti-disturbance function\nfor Fuzzy self-tuning PID compare to the conventional type. Fuzzy self-tuning\nPID can tune the PID parameters for achieving the optimal response in view of\nspeed, overshoot, and steady-state error in conditions of inappropriate tuning\nof PID parameters, based on the results of simulation in short-period\napproximation, the proposed controller can adaptively improve the system\nresponse by on-line setting of PID parameters.\n",

Much work has been\ndone on using probe data to estimate the current speed of vehicle traffic (or\nequivalently, trip travel time). While travel times are useful to individual\ndrivers, the state variable for a large class of traffic models and control\nalgorithms is vehicle density. Our goal is to use probe data to supplement\ntraditional, fixed-location loop detector data for density estimation. To this\nend, we derive a method based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filters, a\nsequential Monte Carlo scheme. We present a simulation where we obtain a 30\\%\nreduction in density mean absolute percentage error from fusing loop and probe\ndata, vs. using loop data alone. We also present results using real data from a\n19-mile freeway section in Los Angeles, California, where we obtain a 31\\%\nreduction. In addition, our method's estimate when using only the real-world\nprobe data, and no loop data, outperformed the estimate produced when only loop\ndata were used (an 18\\% reduction). These results demonstrate that probe data\ncan be used for traffic density estimation.\n",

An intersection is modeled as an area containing multiple\nconflict points where vehicle paths cross in the future. At every time step,\nthe supervisor determines whether there will be more than one vehicle in the\nvicinity of a conflict point at the same time. If there is, then an impending\ncollision is detected, and the supervisor overrides the drivers to avoid\ncollision. A major challenge in the design of a supervisor as opposed to an\nautonomous vehicle controller is to verify whether future collisions will occur\nbased on the current drivers choices. This verification problem is particularly\nhard due to the large number of vehicles often involved in intersection\ncollision, to the multitude of conflict points, and to the vehicles dynamics.\nIn order to solve the verification problem, we translate the problem to a\njob-shop scheduling problem that yields equivalent answers. The job-shop\nscheduling problem can, in turn, be transformed into a mixed-integer linear\nprogram when the vehicle dynamics are first-order dynamics, and can thus be\nsolved by using a commercial solver.\n",

Such game-solving algorithms\nscale poorly as the size of the game graph increases. However, in many\napplications, the game graph has a natural hierarchical structure. In this\npaper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits\nthis hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis.\n  We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism which\ndecomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First,\nthe construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers,\nwhere each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is\ndecomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the\nhigher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the\nstate space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis\nproblems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional\nrequirements on lower-level local games.\n  Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for\nlocal game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible\nwinning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of\nenvironment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies\ndue to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step\nof the play. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound: the controller\nconstructs a play which satisfies all local specifications.

In the presence of communication noise, however, the maximum\nestimate will incorrectly drift and the estimate at each sensor will diverge.\nAs a result, a soft-max approximation together with a non-linear consensus\nalgorithm is introduced herein. A design parameter controls the trade-off\nbetween the soft-max error and convergence speed. An analysis of this trade-off\ngives a guideline towards how to choose the design parameter for the max\nestimate. We also show that if some prior knowledge of the initial measurements\nis available, the consensus process can converge faster by using an optimal\nstep size in the iterative algorithm. A shifted non-linear bounded transmit\nfunction is also introduced for faster convergence when sensor nodes have some\nprior knowledge of the initial measurements.

        "summary": "  Traditional power dispatch methods have difficulties in accommodating\nlarge-scale variable renewable generation (VRG) and have resulted in\nunnecessary VRG spillage in the practical industry. The recent\ndispatchable-interval-based methods have the potential to reduce VRG\ncurtailment, but the dispatchable intervals are not allocated effectively due\nto the lack of exploiting historical dispatch records of VRG units. To bridge\nthis gap, this paper proposes a novel data-driven real-time dispatch approach\nto maximize VRG utili-zation by using do-not-exceed (DNE) limits. This approach\ndefines the maximum generation output ranges that the system can ac-commodate\nwithout compromising reliability. The DNE limits of VRG units and operating\nbase points of conventional units are co-optimized by hybrid stochastic and\nrobust optimization, and the decision models are formulated as mixed-integer\nlinear programs by the sample average approximation technique exploiting\nhistorical VRG data. A strategy for selecting historical data samples is also\nproposed to capture the VRG uncertainty more accurately under variant\nprediction output levels. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methods.\n",

The trade-off between robustness to winds and\nsensitivity to faults is challenging due to simultaneous influence of winds and\nlatent faults on monitored sensors. Different from conventional residual\ngenerators that do not consider any constraints, we propose a constrained\nresidual generator using moving horizon estimation. The main contribution is\nimproved fault sensitivity by exploiting known bounds on winds in residual\ngeneration. By analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the formulated\nmoving horizon estimation problem, it is shown that this improvement is\nattributed to active inequality constraints caused by faults. When the\nweighting matrices in the moving horizon estimation problem are tuned to\nincrease robustness to winds, its fault sensitivity does not simply decrease as\none would expect in conventional unconstrained residual generators. Instead,\nits fault sensitivity increases when the fault is large enough to activate some\ninequality constraints. This fault sensitivity improvement is not restricted to\nthis particular application, but can be achieved by any general moving horizon\nestimation based residual generator. A high-fidelity Airbus simulator is used\nto illustrate the advantage of our proposed approach in terms of fault\nsensitivity.\n",

Due to beneficial\ninsights of the PDEs, recently, the reverse of this approach is implemented\nwhere a spatially-discrete system is approximated by a spatially-continuous\none, governed by linear PDEs forming diffusion equations. In the case of\ndistributed consensus algorithms, this approach is adapted to enhance its\nconvergence rate to the equilibrium. In previous studies within this context,\nconstant diffusion parameter is considered for obtaining the diffusion\nequations. This is equivalent to assigning a constant weight to all edges of\nthe underlying graph in the consensus algorithm. Here, by relaxing this\nrestricting assumption, a spatially-variable diffusion parameter is considered\nand by optimizing the obtained system, it is shown that significant\nimprovements are achievable in terms of the convergence rate of the obtained\nspatially-continuous system. As a result of approximation, the system is\ndivided into two sections, namely, the spatially-continuous path branches and\nthe lattice core which connects these branches at one end. The optimized\nweights and diffusion parameter for each of these sections are optimal\nindividually but considering the whole system, they are suboptimal. It is shown\nthat the symmetric star topology is an exception and the obtained results for\nthis topology are globally optimal.

Further, the asymmetry for the velocity coupling can be\nchosen differently to the asymmetry in the position coupling. It is\ninvestigated how the effect of disturbance on the control errors in the string\ndepends on the string length. It is shown, that in case of symmetric position\ncoupling and asymmetric velocity coupling, linear scaling can be achieved. For\nsymmetric interaction in both states, i.e., in symmetric bidirectional strings,\nthe errors scale quadratically in the number of vehicles. When the coupling in\nposition is asymmetric, exponential scaling may occur or the system might even\nbecome unstable.

Although all the model parameters do vary with SOC,\nglobal sensitivity analysis reveals that the uncertainties of some of the\nparameters generate very little uncertainty in the voltage output, implying\nthat those parameters can be taken as constants without compromising the\naccuracy of the model. This is further confirmed by experimental validation.\n",

The paper\npresents two distinct approaches to modelling the voltage control of generator\nnodes.

This new framework for power flow\nstudies exploits the theory of analytic continuation, especially the monodromy\ntheorem for resolving issues that have plagued conventional numerical methods\nfor decades.

Despite apparent environmental and economic advantages of EVs,\ntheir high demand charging jobs pose an immense challenge to the existing\nelectricity grid infrastructure. In microgrids, as the small-scale version of\ntraditional power grid, however, the EV charging scheduling is more\nchallenging. This is because, the microgrid owner, as a large electricity\ncustomer, is interested in shaving its global peak demand, i.e., the aggregated\ndemand over multiple parking stations, to reduce total electricity cost. While\nthe EV charging scheduling problem in single station scenario has been studied\nextensively in the previous research, the microgrid-level problem with multiple\nstations subject to a global peak constraint is not tackled. This paper aims to\npropose a near-optimal EV charging scheduling mechanism in a microgrid governed\nby a single utility provider with multiple charging stations. The goal is to\nmaximize the total revenue while respecting both local and global peak\nconstraints. The underlying problem, however, is a NP-hard mixed integer linear\nproblem which is difficult to tackle and calls for approximation algorithm\ndesign. We design a primaldual scheduling algorithm which runs in polynomial\ntime and achieves bounded approximation ratio. Moreover, the proposed global\nscheduling algorithm applies a valley-filling strategy to further reduce the\nglobal peak. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm is 98% of the optimum, which is much better than the theoretical\nbound obtained by our approximation analysis. Our algorithm reduces the peak\ndemand obtained by the existing alternative algorithm by 16% and simultaneously\nachieves better resource utilization.\n",

Maintaining security of UAVs under cyber attacks is an\nimportant yet challenging task, as these attacks are often erratic and\ndifficult to predict. Secure estimation problems study how to estimate the\nstates of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and maliciously corrupted\nsensor measurements. The fewer assumptions that an estimator makes about the\nattacker, the larger the set of attacks it can protect the system against. In\nthis paper, we focus on sensor attacks on UAVs and attempt to design a secure\nestimator for linear time-invariant systems based on as few assumptions about\nthe attackers as possible. We propose a computationally efficient estimator\nthat protects the system against arbitrary and unbounded attacks, where the set\nof attacked sensors can also change over time. In addition, we propose to\ncombine our secure estimator with a Kalman Filter for improved practical\nperformance and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations of two\nscenarios where an UAV is under adversarial cyber attack.\n",

A two steps approach\ntaking advantage of the model predictive control methodology is designed on\npurpose to optimally allocate the reference charging power while managing the\npriority among the plugged vehicles and then control the storage for\nefficiently sustaining the charging process. Two different use cases are\nconsidered: in the former the charging area is disconnected from the grid, so\nthat the objective is to minimize the deviation of electric vehicles charging\npower from the nominal value; in the latter the focus is on the point of\nconnection to the grid and the need of mitigating the related power flow. In\nboth cases the fundamental requirement for feasible control system operation is\nto guarantee stability of the storage's state of charge over the time.\nSimulation results are provided and discussed in detail, showing the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",

Next, a method for deriving reduced-order\nhierarchical decentralized stabilizing controllers is presented by suitable\nselections of the weighting matrices in the LQR performance index. Secondly,\nthe hierarchical decentralized robust controller designs in terms of\n$H_{\\infty}$ and $H_{2}$ norms are introduced, which include two different\nscenarios namely general and LQR-based synthesis. For the general synthesis,\nthe robust controller gains are computed as solutions of a distributed convex\noptimization problem with LMI constraints. On the other hand, for the LQR-based\ndesign, the robust controller gains obtained from the general synthesis are\nfurther verified as LQR stabilizing gains to be unified with the LQR-based\ndesign when there are no disturbances/noise. This results in a hierarchical\ndecentralized inverse optimal control problem, for which we will propose a new\nmethod to resolve it.

Particularly, a mechanism is designed\nfor the SFC to decide on the energy surplus, if there is any, that it can use\nto charge its battery and sell to the households and the grid based on the\noffered prices. In this regard, a hierarchical energy management scheme is\nproposed with a view to reduce the total operational cost to the SFC. The\nconcept of a virtual cost (VC) is introduced that aids the SFC to estimate its\nfuture operational cost based on some available current information. The energy\nmanagement is conducted for three different cases and the optimal cost to the\nSFC is determined for each case via the theory of maxima and minima.

        "summary": "  Maximum Causal Entropy (MCE) Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) has become an\neffective tool for modelling human behaviour in many control tasks. Its\nadvantage over classic techniques for estimating human policies is the\ntransferability of the inferred objectives: Behaviour can be predicted in\nvariations of the control task by policy computation using a relaxed optimality\ncriterion. However, exact policy inference is often computationally intractable\nin control problems with imperfect state observation. In this work, we present\na model class that allows modelling human control of two tasks of which only\none be perfectly observed at a time requiring attention switching. We show how\nefficient and exact objective and policy inference via MCE can be conducted for\nthese control problems. Both MCE-IOC and Maximum Causal Likelihood (MCL)-IOC, a\nvariant of the original MCE approach, as well as Direct Policy Estimation (DPE)\nare evaluated using simulated and real behavioural data. Prediction error and\ngeneralization over changes in the control process are both considered in the\nevaluation. The results show a clear advantage of both IOC methods over DPE,\nespecially in the transfer over variation of the control process. MCE and MCL\nperformed similar when training on a large set of simulated data, but differed\nsignificantly on small sets and real data.\n",

We\nbegin the paper with an analysis of the stability of the decision-making\naspects of command organizations from a system-theoretic perspective. A simple\ndynamic model shows how an organization can enter into a self-reinforcing cycle\nof increasing decision workload until the demand for decisions exceeds the\ndecision-making capacity of the organization. We then extend the model to more\ncomplex networked organizations and show that they also experience a form of\nself-reinforcing degradation. In particular, we find that the degradation in\ndecision quality has a tendency to propagate through the hierarchical\nstructure, i.e. overload at one location affects other locations by overloading\nthe higher-level components which then in turn overload their subordinates. Our\ncomputational experiments suggest several strategies for mitigating this type\nof malfunction: dumping excessive load, empowering lower echelons, minimizing\nthe need for coordination, using command-by-negation, insulating weak\nperformers, and applying on-line diagnostics. We describe a method to allocate\ndecision responsibility and arrange information flow dynamically within a team\nof decision-makers for command and control.\n",

        "summary": "  Power grids normally operate at some stable operating condition where power\nsupply and demand are balanced. In response to emergency situations, load\nshedding is a prevailing approach where local protective devices are activated\nto cut a suitable amount of load to quickly rebalance the supply demand and\nhopefully stabilize the system. This traditional emergency control results in\ninterrupted service with severe economic damage to customers. Also, such\ncontrol is usually less effective due to the lack of coordination among\nprotective devices. In this paper, we propose a novel structural emergency\ncontrol to render post-fault dynamics from the critical/emergency fault-cleared\nstate to the stable equilibrium point. This is a new control paradigm that does\nnot rely on any continuous measurement or load shedding, as in the classical\nsetup. Instead, the grid is made stable by discretely relocating the\nequilibrium point and its stability region such that the system is\nconsecutively attracted from the fault-cleared state back to the original\nequilibrium point. The proposed control is designed by solving linear and\nconvex optimization problems, making it possibly scalable to large-scale power\ngrids. Finally, this emergency control scheme can be implemented by exploiting\ntransmission facilities available on the existing grids.\n",

In\npractice, since the transmitters (power chargers) are usually at fixed\nlocations and the receiver (e.g. mobile phone) is desired to be freely located\nin a target region for wireless charging, its received power can fluctuate\nsignificantly over locations even with adaptive magnetic beamforming applied.\nTo achieve uniform coverage, the transmitters need to be optimally placed in\nthe region, which motivates this paper. First, we derive the optimal magnetic\nbeamforming solution in closed-form for a distributed MISO WPT system with\ngiven locations of the transmitters and receiver to maximize the deliverable\npower to the receiver load subject to a given sum-power constraint at all\ntransmitters. With the optimal magnetic beamforming solution, we then jointly\noptimize the locations of all transmitters to maximize the minimum power\ndeliverable to the receiver when it is being moved over a given one-dimensional\n(1D) region, i.e., a line of finite length. Although the formulated node\nplacement problem is non-convex, we propose an iterative algorithm for solving\nit efficiently.

        "summary": "  This work introduces a scalable filtering algorithm for multi-agent traffic\nestimation. Large-scale networks are spatially partitioned into overlapping\nroad sections. The traffic dynamics of each section is given by the switching\nmode model (SMM) using a conservation principle, and the traffic state in each\nsection is estimated by a local agent. In the proposed filter, a consensus term\nis applied to promote inter-agent agreement on overlapping sections. The new\nfilter, termed a (spatially) distributed local Kalman consensus filter (DLKCF),\nis shown to maintain globally asymptotically stable (GAS) mean error dynamics\nwhen all sections switch among observable modes. When a section is\nunobservable, we show that the mean estimate of each state variable in the\nsection is ultimately bounded, which is achieved by exploring the interaction\nbetween the properties of the traffic model and the measurement feedback of the\nfilter. Based on the above results, the boundedness of the mean estimation\nerror of the DLKCF under switching sequences with observable and unobservable\nmodes is established to address the overall performance of the filter.\nNumerical experiments show the ability of the DLKCF to promote consensus,\nincrease estimation accuracy compared to a local filter, and reduce the\ncomputational load compared to a centralized approach.\n",

We develop a distributed\nobserver that guarantees asymptotic reconstruction of the state for the most\ngeneral class of LTI systems, sensor network topologies and sensor measurement\nstructures. Our analysis builds upon the following key observation - a given\nnode can reconstruct a portion of the state solely by using its own\nmeasurements and constructing appropriate Luenberger observers; hence it only\nneeds to exchange information with neighbors (via consensus dynamics) for\nestimating the portion of the state that is not locally detectable. This\nintuitive approach leads to a new class of distributed observers with several\nappealing features. Furthermore, by imposing additional constraints on the\nsystem dynamics and network topology, we show that it is possible to construct\na simpler version of the proposed distributed observer that achieves the same\nobjective while admitting a fully distributed design phase. Our general\nframework allows extensions to time-varying networks that result from\ncommunication losses, and scenarios including faults or attacks at the nodes.\n",

Prior to the\ncontrol design, we analyze the existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium\norientation along a reference velocity. We show that shape symmetries and\naerodynamic stall phenomena imply the existence of the equilibrium orientation\nirrespective of the reference velocity. The equilibrium orientation, however,\nis not in general unique, and this may trigger an aircraft loss-of-control for\nspecific reference velocities. Conditions that ensure the local and the global\nuniqueness of the equilibrium orientation are stated. We show that the\nuniqueness of the equilibrium orientation is intimately related to the\nso-called spherical equivalency, i.e. the existence of a thrust change of\nvariable rendering the direction of the transformed external force independent\nof the vehicle's orientation, as in the case of spherical shapes. Once this\ntransformation is applied, control laws for reference velocities can be\ndesigned. These laws extend the so-called vectored--thrust control paradigm\n%developed for systems subject to orientation-independent external forces, e.g.\nspherical shapes, to the case of generic body shapes subject to steady\naerodynamics.\n",

One strategy is to reduce the size of a\nsupervisor to generate a control equivalent version, whose size is hopefully\nmuch smaller than the original one so that a user or control designer can\neasily check whether a designed controller fulfils its objectives and\nrequirements. After the first journal paper on this topic appeared in 1986 by\nVaz and Wonham, which relied on the concept of control covers, in 2004 Su and\nWonham proposed to use control congruences to ensure computational viability.\nThis work is later adopted in the supervisor localization theory, which aims\nfor a control equivalent distributed implementation of a given centralized\nsupervisor. But after so many publications, some fundamental questions, which\nshould have been addressed in the first place, have not been answered yet,\nnamely what information is critical to ensure control equivalence, what\ninformation is responsible for size reduction, and whether the partial\nobservation really makes things different. In this paper we will address these\nfundamental questions by showing that there does exist a unified supervisor\nreduction theory, which is applicable to all feasible supervisors regardless of\nwhether they are under full observation or partial observation. Our theory\nprovides a partial order over all control equivalent feasible supervisors based\non their enabling, disabling and marking information, which can be used to\ncategorize the corresponding reduction rates. Based on this result we can see\nthat, given two control equivalent feasible supervisors, the one under full\nobservation can always result in a reduced supervisor no bigger than that\ninduced by a supervisor under partial observation.\n",

Unlike existing model reduction\nmethods, the external system does not need to be linearized but is directly\ndealt with as a nonlinear system. A transformation is found to balance the\ncontrollability and observability covariances in order to determine which\nstates have the greatest contribution to the input-output behavior. The\noriginal system model is then reduced by Galerkin projection based on this\ntransformation. The proposed method is tested and validated on a system\ncomprised of a 16-machine 68-bus system and an IEEE 50-machine 145-bus system.\nThe results show that by using the proposed model reduction the calculation\nefficiency can be greatly improved; at the same time, the obtained state\ntrajectories are close to those for directly simulating the whole system or\npartitioning the system while not performing reduction. Compared with the\nbalanced truncation method based on a linearized model, the proposed nonlinear\nmodel reduction method can guarantee higher accuracy and similar calculation\nefficiency. It is shown that the proposed method is not sensitive to the choice\nof the matrices for calculating the empirical covariances.\n",

An efficient operation and\nplanning relies on a holistic framework that takes into account the\ninterdependent decision-making of the generators of the existing power grids\nand the distributed resources of the microgrid in the integrated system. To\nthis end, we use a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to study the\ninteractions between generators (leaders) and microgrids (followers). Entities\non both sides make strategic decisions on the amount of power generation to\nmaximize their payoffs. Our framework not only takes into account the economic\nfactors but also incorporates the stability and efficiency of the smart grid,\nsuch as the power flow constraints and voltage angle regulations. We develop\nthree update schemes for both generators and microgrids, respectively, and\namong which a fully distributed algorithm enabled by phasor measurement units\nis presented. The distributed algorithm merely requires the information of\nvoltage angles at local buses for updates, and its convergence to the unique\nequilibrium is shown. We further develop the implementation architectures of\nthe update schemes in the smart grid. Finally, case studies are used to\ncorroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n",

A practical way of dealing with large-scale\nnetworks is to reduce their dimension by collapsing the states of nodes\nbelonging to densely and intensively connected clusters into aggregate\nvariables. It will be shown that under suitable conditions, the states of the\nagents in each cluster converge fast toward a local agreement. Local agreements\ncorrespond to aggregate variables which slowly converge to consensus. Existing\nresults concerning the time-scale separation in large networks focus on fixed\nand undirected graphs. The aim of this work is to extend these results to the\nmore general case of time-varying directed topologies. It is noteworthy that in\nthe fixed and undirected graph case the average of the states in each cluster\nis time-invariant when neglecting the interactions between clusters. Therefore,\nthey are good candidates for the aggregate variables. This is no longer\npossible here. Instead, we find suitable time-varying weights to compute the\naggregate variables as time-invariant weighted averages of the states in each\ncluster. This allows to deal with the more challenging time-varying directed\ngraph case. We end up with a singularly perturbed system which is analyzed by\nusing the tools of two time-scales averaging which seem appropriate to this\nsystem.\n",

Depending on the\nsystem dynamics, the candidate Lyapunov function and the set of initial states\nof interest, one generally needs to handle large, possibly non-convex or\nnon-feasible optimization problems. To avoid such problems, we propose a\nconstructive and systematically applicable sampling-based method to Lyapunov's\ninequality verification. This approach proposes verification of the decrease\ncondition for a candidate Lyapunov function on a finite sampling of a bounded\nset of initial conditions and then it extends the validity of the Lyapunov\nfunction to an infinite set of initial conditions by automatically exploiting\ncontinuity properties. This result is based on multi-resolution sampling, to\nperform efficient state- space exploration. Using hyper-rectangles as basic\nsampling blocks, to account for different constraint scales on different\nstates, further reduces the amount of samples to be verified. Moreover, the\nverification is decentralized in the sampling points, which makes the method\nscalable. The proposed methodology is illustrated through examples.\n",

In order to\nidentify their dynamical properties and/or their topology consistently from\nmeasured data, we need to make sure that the network model set is identifiable.\nWe introduce the notion of network identifiability, as a property of a\nparameterized model set, that ensures that different network models can be\ndistinguished from each other when performing identification on the basis of\nmeasured data. Different from the classical notion of (parameter)\nidentifiability, we focus on the distinction between network models in terms of\ntheir transfer functions. For a given structured model set with a pre-chosen\ntopology, identifiability typically requires conditions on the presence and\nlocation of excitation signals, and on presence, location and correlation of\ndisturbance signals. Because in a dynamic network, disturbances cannot always\nbe considered to be of full-rank, the reduced-rank situation is also covered,\nmeaning that the number of driving white noise processes can be strictly less\nthan the number of disturbance variables.

An\nattacker may generate noises to exacerbate the communication channels between\nsensors and the fusion center.

The problem is formulated as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) problem, and the existence of an optimal deterministic\nand stationary policy is proved. We further show that the optimal policy has a\nthreshold structure, by which the computational complexity is reduced\nsignificantly.

        "summary": "  The arrival of small-scale distributed energy generation in the future smart\ngrid has led to the emergence of so-called prosumers, who can both consume as\nwell as produce energy. By using local generation from renewable energy\nresources, the stress on power generation and supply system can be\nsignificantly reduced during high demand periods. However, this also creates a\nsignificant challenge for conventional power plants that suddenly need to ramp\nup quickly when the renewable energy drops off. In this paper, we propose an\nenergy consumption scheduling problem for prosumers to minimize the peak ramp\nof the system. The optimal schedule of prosumers can be obtained by solving the\ncentralized optimization problem. However, due to the privacy concerns and the\ndistributed topology of the power system, the centralized design is difficult\nto implement in practice. Therefore, we propose the distributed algorithms to\nefficiently solve the centralized problem using the alternating direction\nmethod of multiplier (ADMM), in which each prosumer independently schedules its\nenergy consumption profile. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence\nperformance of the proposed algorithms as well as the capability of our model\nin reducing the peak ramp of the system.\n",

The performance of the PLLs is affected by the\nnon-ideal conditions in the sensed grid voltage such as harmonics, frequency\ndeviations and dc offsets in single-phase systems. In this paper, a\nsingle-phase PLL is presented to mitigate the effects of these non-idealities.\nThis PLL is based on the popular second order generalized integrator (SOGI)\nstructure. The SOGI structure is modified to eliminate of the effects of input\ndc offsets. The resulting SOGI structure has a high-pass filtering property.\nHence, this PLL is termed as high-pass generalized integrator based PLL\n(HGI-PLL). It has fixed parameters which reduces the implementation complexity\nand aids in the implementation in low-end digital controllers. The HGI-PLL is\nshown to have least resource utilization among the SOGI based PLLs with dc\ncancelling capability. Systematic design methods are evolved leading to the\ndesign that limits the unit vector THD to within 1% for given non-ideal input\nconditions in terms of frequency deviation and harmonic distortion. The\nproposed designs achieve the fastest transient response. The performance of\nthis PLL has been verified experimentally. The results are found to agree with\nthe theoretical prediction.\n",

By relying on the use of a forgetting\nfactor, we propose two methods to tackle the tracking of time-varying systems.\nIn one of them, the forgetting factor is estimated by treating it as a\nhyper-parameter of the Bayesian inference procedure.\n",

The system is modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the\nstates represent partitions of a continuous space and the transition\nprobabilities are unknown. We formulate two synthesis problems where the\ndesired STL specification is enforced by maximizing the probability of\nsatisfaction, and the expected robustness degree, that is, a measure\nquantifying the quality of satisfaction. We discuss that Q-learning is not\ndirectly applicable to these problems because, based on the quantitative\nsemantics of STL, the probability of satisfaction and expected robustness\ndegree are not in the standard objective form of Q-learning. To resolve this\nissue, we propose an approximation of STL synthesis problems that can be solved\nvia Q-learning, and we derive some performance bounds for the policies obtained\nby the approximate approach. The performance of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated via simulations.\n",

The investigated LPV-SS model is reformulated into an equivalent\nimpulse response form, which turns out to be a moving average with exogenous\ninputs (MAX) system.

Hence,\nidentifying the LPV-MAX model in the prediction error minimization framework\nwill be consistent and unbiased.

Attack identification is often critical for the\nrecovery and performance of a CPS that is targeted by malicious entities,\nallowing defenders to construct algorithms which bypass harmful nodes. Previous\nwork has characterized limitations in the perfect identification of adversarial\nattacks on deterministic LTI systems. For instance, a system must remain\nobservable after removing any 2q sensors to only identify q attacks. However,\nthe ability for an attacker to create an unidentifiable attack requires\nknowledge of the system model. In this paper, we aim to limit the adversary's\nknowledge of the system model with the goal of accurately identifying all\nsensor attacks. Such a scheme will allow systems to withstand larger attacks or\nsystem operators to allocate fewer sensing devices to a control system while\nmaintaining security.

We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for electric loads and\nbattery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and\nconstraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time\nscheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid,\nnamed Significant Moments Analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments\nwhen electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a\ndynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of electric loads. Using SMA,\nwe can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can\ngenerate enough power to support the execution of electric loads. In the case\nwhere the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can provide\naccurate information about the amount of insufficient power and the time when\nthe insufficiency happens. Simulated results are presented to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed analysis method.\n",

Our objective is avoiding communication\nconflict while guaranteeing stability of all control loops.

A\ndecoupled impedance model is highly appealing since the\nSingle-Input-Single-Output (SISO) structure makes the analysis and result\ninterpretation very simple. On the other hand, matrix impedance models are more\naccurate, and in some cases necessary. Previous works have applied various\napproximations to obtain decoupled models, and both the dq- and sequence\ndomains have been used. This paper introduces the terms decoupled and\nsemi-decoupled impedance models in order to have a clear classification of the\navailable approximations.\n  The accuracy of 4 decoupled impedance models are discussed based on the\nconcept of Mirror Frequency Coupling (MFC). By definition the decoupled models\nbased on sequence domain impedances will be exact for systems without MFC. In\nthe general case, they are expected to be more accurate than the decoupled\ndq-impedance models. The paper defines a norm $\\epsilon$ to measure the degree\nof coupling in the impedance matrices. This norm equals the error in the\neigenvalue loci between the matrix and semi-decoupled models. This can also be\nviewed as the error in the semi-decoupled Nyquist plot.\n  An example case study consisting of a grid-connected VSC with current\ncontroller and PLL is used to compare the different methods. It is found that\ndecoupled and semi-decoupled models in the dq-domain are only applicable in\ngrids with very low X/R-ratio.

The increase in renewable\ngeneration, however, has resulted in new challenges in supply-load balancing,\nowing to its intermittent, non-predictable and volatile generation features.\nSeveral methods have been introduced to cope with negative impacts of the\nrenewable generation deployment. In this paper, a novel method, i.e., the\napplication of microgrids in capturing the variabilities of distributed\nrenewable generation in distribution networks is proposed and investigated.\nUtilizing available flexibility of microgrids represents a local and viable\nsolution which leads to lower investments from electric utilities for\nincreasing their flexibility and providing more reserved power. It is\ninvestigated that how the system flexibility requirements can be integrated\ninto the microgrid optimal scheduling model to enable microgrids in supporting\nthe grid operators by offering flexibility services. Using the proposed\nflexibility constraints, intra-hour and inter-hour variabilities at the\ndistribution feeder will be efficiently captured. Numerical simulations on a\ntest distribution feeder, with one microgrid and several renewable-equipped\nconsumers, show the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n",

As LCOE is a levelized value,\nit provides a quick and easy measure to compare different energy resource\ntechnologies with different characteristics. The LCOE calculation for\nlarge-scale power plants and distributed generations (DGs) is extensively\nstudied and can be found in the literature. The discussions on the LCOE\ncalculation for energy storage systems, however, is limited. Although still\nrelatively expensive compared to generation technologies, energy storage is\ngaining significant attention and has been deployed extensively during the past\nfew years, conceivably due to its many benefits such as load shifting, energy\narbitrage, and renewable coordination. Therefore, LCOE calculation of energy\nstorage systems plays an important role in economic evaluation of power\nsystems. This paper proposes a method for calculating the LCOE of energy\nstorage, and further provides the sensitivity analysis with respect to changes\nin capacity, electricity market prices, and efficiency.\n",

Shared spaces constitute considerable office space\narea, in which most office employees perform their meetings and daily tasks,\nand therefore the ACs in these areas have significant impact on the energy\nusage of the entire office building. The cost of this energy consumption,\nhowever, is not paid by the shared space users, and the AC's temperature\nset-point is not determined based on the users' preferences. This latter factor\nis compounded by the fact that different people may have different choices of\ntemperature set-points and sensitivities to change of temperature. Therefore,\nit is a challenging task to design an office policy to decide on a particular\nset-point based on such a diverse preference set. As a result, users are not\naware of the energy consumption in shared spaces, which may potentially\nincrease the energy wastage and related cost of office buildings. In this\ncontext, this paper proposes an energy policy for an office shared space by\nexploiting an established temperature control mechanism. In particular, we\nchoose meeting rooms in an office building as the test case and design a policy\naccording to which each user of the room can give a preference on the\ntemperature set-point and is paid for felt discomfort if the set-point is not\nfixed according to the given preference. On the other hand, users who enjoy the\nthermal comfort compensate the other users of the room. Thus, the policy\nenables the users to be cognizant and responsible for the payment on the energy\nconsumption of the office space they are sharing, and at the same time ensures\nthat the users are satisfied either via thermal comfort or through incentives.\nThe policy is also shown to be beneficial for building management. Through\nexperiment based case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed\npolicy.\n",

The importance of this choice is that, for\nthe prediction error method (PEM) to provide asymptotically efficient\nestimates, the model orders must be chosen according to the true system.\nHowever, if only the plant estimates are of interest and the experiment is\nperformed in open loop, the noise model may be over-parameterized without\naffecting the asymptotic properties of the plant. The limitation is that, as\nPEM suffers in general from non-convexity, estimating an unnecessarily large\nnumber of parameters will increase the chances of getting trapped in local\nminima. To avoid this, a high order ARX model can first be estimated by least\nsquares, providing non-parametric estimates of the plant and noise model. Then,\nmodel order reduction can be used to obtain a parametric model of the plant\nonly. We review existing methods to perform this, pointing out limitations and\nconnections between them.

This effect is shown by proving an\nasymptotically decreasing error upper bound on the covariance matrix associated\nto the innovation structure in case the covariance matrix is subjected to an\nincorrect initialization or disturbance. Secondly, we show by an example that\nan LPV-SS representation that has dynamical, rational dependency on the\nscheduling signal can be transformed into static, affinely dependent\nrepresentation by introducing additional states.

        "summary": "  Distributed consensus has been intensively studied in recent years as a means\nto mitigate state differences among dynamic nodes on a graph. It has been\nsuccessfully employed in various applications, e.g., formation control of\nmulti-robots, load balancing, clock synchronization. However, almost all\nexisting applications cast an impression of consensus as a simple process to\niteratively reach agreement, without any clue on possibility to generate\nadvanced complexity, say shortest path planning, which has been proved to be\nNP-hard. Counter-intuitively, we show for the first time that the complexity of\nshortest path planning can emerge from a perturbed version of min-consensus\nprotocol, which as a case study may shed lights to researchers in the field of\ndistributed control to re-think the nature of complexity and the distance\nbetween control and intelligence. Besides, we rigorously prove the convergence\nof graph dynamics and its equivalence to shortest path solutions. An\nillustrative simulation on a small scale graph is provided to show the\nconvergence of the biased min-consensus dynamics to shortest path solution over\nthe graph. To demonstrate the scalability to large scale problems, a graph with\n43826 nodes, which corresponds to a map of a maze in 2D, is considered in the\nsimulation study. Apart from possible applications in robot path planning, the\nresult is further extended to robot complete coverage, showing its potential in\nreal practice such as cleaning robots.\n",

We will focus our analysis on\ndemand-response policies based on automatic decisions by the so-called smart\nhome appliances. Following the usual design approach, each individual appliance\nhas access to a universal signal (e.g. grid frequency or electricity price)\nthat is believed to indicate the system state. Such information is then used as\nthe basis of the appliances' individual decisions. While each single device has\na negligible impact in the system, the aggregate effect of the distributed\nappliances' reactions is expect to bring improvements in the system efficiency;\nthis effect is the demand-response policy goal. The smartness of such an ideal\nsystem, composed by isolated appliances with their individual decisions, but\nconnected in the same physical grid, may worsen the system stability. This\nfirst-sight undesirable outcome comes as a consequence of synchronization among\nagents that are subject to the same signal. We argue that this effect is in\nfact byproduct of methodological choices, which are many times implicit. To\nsupport this claim, we employ a different approach that understands the\nelectricity system as constituted by physical, informational and regulatory\n(networked and structured) layers that cannot be reduced to only one or two of\nthem, but have to be viewed as an organic whole. By classifying its structure\nunder this lens, more appropriate management tools can be designed by looking\nat the system totality in action.

In order to ensure the occupant's\nsafety in these situations, the ability to plan controllable but near-limits\ntrajectories will be of very high importance.

While further error reduction is expected to be achievable by\nincreasing the number of vehicles, the quantitative relationship between the\nestimation error and the number of connected vehicles has neither been\nsystematically investigated nor analytically proved. In this work, a\ntheoretical study is presented that analytically proves the correlation between\nthe localization error and the number of connected vehicles in two cases of\npractical interest. More specifically, it is shown that, under the assumption\nof small non-common error, the expected square error of the GNSS common error\ncorrection is inversely proportional to the number of vehicles, if the road\ndirections obey a uniform distribution, or inversely proportional to logarithm\nof the number of vehicles, if the road directions obey a Bernoulli\ndistribution. Numerical simulations are conducted to justify these analytic\nresults. Moreover, the simulation results show that the aforementioned error\ndecrement rates hold even when the assumption of small non-common error is\nviolated.\n",

The\npresented approach enables Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations, meaning that DGUs\ncan be added or removed without compromising the overall ImG stability. The\nmain feature of our approach is that the proposed design algorithm is\nline-independent. This implies that (i) the synthesis of each local controller\nrequires only the parameters of the corresponding DGU and not the model of\npower lines connecting neighboring DGUs, and (ii) whenever a new DGU is plugged\nin, DGUs physically coupled with it do not have to retune their regulators\nbecause of the new power line connected to them. Moreover, we formally prove\nthat stabilizing local controllers can be always computed, independently of the\nelectrical parameters.

Whereas synchronization algorithms\nfor identical agents have been thoroughly studied, synchronization of\nheterogeneous networks still remains a challenging problem. The existing\nalgorithms primarily use the internal model principle, assigning to each agent\na local copy of some dynamical system (internal model). Synchronization of\nheterogeneous agents thus reduces to global synchronization of identical\ngenerators and local synchronization between the agents and their internal\nmodels. The internal model approach imposes a number of restrictions and leads\nto sophisticated dynamical (and, in general, nonlinear) controllers. At the\nsame time, passive heterogeneous agents can be synchronized by a very simple\nlinear protocol, which is used for consensus of first-order integrators. A\nnatural question arises whether analogous algorithms are applicable to\nsynchronization of agents that do not satisfy the passivity condition. In this\npaper, we study the synchronization problem for heterogeneous agents that are\nnot passive but satisfy a weaker input feedforward passivity (IFP) condition.\nWe show that such agents can also be synchronized by a simple linear protocol,\nprovided that the interaction graph is strongly connected and the couplings are\nsufficiently weak.

In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing control\nrefinement approaches for DAE systems via the notions of (bi)simulation\nrelations and approximate simulation relations from computer science. The\nquantified refinement accuracy is achieved by defining observation metrics over\na general system framework named transition systems.

Consequently, well-developed model reduction approaches can be\napplied to obtain an abstract simplified system, which can be rewritten into a\nDAE system again.

By regarding the\ndisturbances on the elements as the control inputs, we formulate the problem of\ndetermining the initial disturbances causing the cascading blackout of power\ngrids in the framework of optimal control theory, and the magnitude of\ndisturbances or faults on the selected branch can be obtained by solving the\nsystem of algebraic equations.

Theoretical analysis guarantees the asymptotic convergence\nof the iterative search algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are carried\nout in IEEE 9 Bus System and IEEE 14 Bus System to validate the proposed\napproach.\n",

Specifically, we extend the\nPRojection Operator based Netwon's method for Trajectory Optimization (PRONTO),\nwhich was proposed by Hauser for unconstrained optimal control problems. While\nin the standard method final-state constraints can be only approximately\nhandled by means of a terminal penalty, in this work we propose a methodology\nto meet the constraints exactly. Moreover, our method guarantees recursive\nfeasibility of the final-state constraint. This is an appealing property\nespecially in realtime applications in which one would like to be able to stop\nthe computation even if the desired tolerance has not been reached, but still\nsatisfy the constraints. Following the same conceptual idea of PRONTO, the\nproposed strategy is based on two main steps which (differently from the\nstandard scheme) preserve the feasibility of the final-state constraints: (i)\nsolve a quadratic approximation of the nonlinear problem to find a descent\ndirection, and (ii) get a (feasible) trajectory by means of a feedback law\n(which turns out to be a nonlinear projection operator). To find the (feasible)\ndescent direction we take advantage of final-state constrained Linear Quadratic\noptimal control methods, while the second step is performed by suitably\ndesigning a constrained version of the trajectory tracking projection operator.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed strategy is tested on the optimal state\ntransfer of an inverted pendulum.\n",

We extend the\nprevious work on ADETC by introducing periodic sampling, denoting our proposal\nasynchronous decentralized periodic event-triggered control (ADPETC), and study\nthe stability and L2-gain of ADPETC for implementations affected by\ndisturbances. In ADPETC, at each sampling time, quantized measurements from\nthose sensors that triggered a local event are transmitted to a dynamic\ncontroller that computes control actions; the quantized control actions are\nthen transmitted to the corresponding actuators only if certain events are also\ntriggered for the corresponding actuator. The developed theory is demonstrated\nand illustrated via a numerical example.\n",

In the primary control\nlayer, each generation unit is equipped with a local controller acting on the\ncorresponding voltage-source converter. Following the plug-and-play design\napproach previously proposed by some of the authors, whenever the\naddition/removal of a distributed generation unit is required, feasibility of\nthe operation is automatically checked by designing local controllers through\nconvex optimization. The update of the voltage-control layer, when units plug\n-in/-out, is therefore automatized and stability of the microgrid is always\npreserved. Moreover, local control design is based only on the knowledge of\nparameters of power lines and it does not require to store a global microgrid\nmodel. In this work, we focus on bus-connected microgrid topologies and enhance\nthe primary plug-and-play layer with local virtual impedance loops and\nsecondary coordinated controllers ensuring bus voltage tracking and reactive\npower sharing. In particular, the secondary control architecture is\ndistributed, hence mirroring the modularity of the primary control layer. We\nvalidate primary and secondary controllers by performing experiments with\nbalanced, unbalanced and nonlinear loads, on a setup composed of three\nbus-connected distributed generation units. Most importantly, the stability of\nthe microgrid after the addition/removal of distributed generation units is\nassessed. Overall, the experimental results show the feasibility of the\nproposed modular control design framework, where generation units can be\nadded/removed on the fly, thus enabling the deployment of virtual power plants\nthat can be resized over time.\n",

When this norm is a weighted\none-norm, we obtain conditions which lead to sum-separable Lyapunov functions,\nand when this norm is a weighted infinity-norm, symmetric conditions lead to\nmax-separable Lyapunov functions.

A practical way is to find out some critical branches as\nthe candidates in advance. This paper proposes a simulation data oriented\napproach to identify the critical branches with higher importance in cascading\nfailure propagation. First, a concept of cascading failure chain (CFC) is\nintroduced and numerous samples of CFC are generated with an AC power flow\nbased cascading failure simulator. Then, a directed weighted graph is\nconstructed, whose edges denotes the severities of branch interactions. Third,\nthe weighted hypertext-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm is used to rate\nand rank this graph's vertices,through which the critical branches can be\nidentified accordingly. Validations on IEEE 118bus and RTS96 systems show that\nthe proposed approach can identify critical branches whose capacity upgrades\nsuppress cascading failure risk more greatly. Moreover, it is also shown that\nstructural importance of a branch does not agree with its importance in\ncascading failure, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach\ncompared with structure vulnerabilities based identifying methods.\n",

Since battery\nreplacement of sensor nodes is generally difficult, long-term monitoring can be\nonly achieved if the operation of the WSN nodes contributes to a long WSN\nlifetime. Two prominent techniques to long WSN lifetime are i) optimal sensor\nactivation and ii) efficient data gathering and forwarding based on compressive\nsensing. These techniques are feasible only if the activated sensor nodes\nestablish a connected communication network (connectivity constraint), and\nsatisfy a compressive sensing decoding constraint (cardinality constraint).\nThese two constraints make the problem of maximizing network lifetime via\nsensor node activation and compressive sensing NP-hard. To overcome this\ndifficulty, an alternative approach that iteratively solves energy balancing\nproblems is proposed. However, understanding whether maximizing network\nlifetime and energy balancing problems are aligned objectives is a fundamental\nopen issue. The analysis reveals that the two optimization problems give\ndifferent solutions, but the difference between the lifetime achieved by the\nenergy balancing approach and the maximum lifetime is small when the initial\nenergy at sensor nodes is significantly larger than the energy consumed for a\nsingle transmission. The lifetime achieved by the energy balancing is\nasymptotically optimal, and that the achievable network lifetime is at least\n$50$\\% of the optimum.

Failsafe mechanism is a control logic that guides\nwhat subsequent actions the multicopter should take, by taking account of\nreal-time information from guidance, attitude control, diagnosis, and other\nlow-level subsystems. In order to design a failsafe mechanism for multicopters,\nsafety issues of multicopters are introduced.

In order to model the user requirements by discrete-event systems,\nseveral multicopter modes and events are defined. On this basis, the\nmulticopter plant and control specifications are modeled by automata. Then, a\nsupervisor is synthesized by monolithic supervisory control theory. In\naddition, we present three examples to demonstrate the potential blocking\nphenomenon due to inappropriate design of control specifications.

        "summary": "  Hysteresis is a highly nonlinear phenomenon, showing up in a wide variety of\nscience and engineering problems. The identification of hysteretic systems from\ninput-output data is a challenging task. Recent work on black-box polynomial\nnonlinear state-space modeling for hysteresis identification has provided\npromising results, but struggles with a large number of parameters due to the\nuse of multivariate polynomials. This drawback is tackled in the current paper\nby applying a decoupling approach that results in a more parsimonious\nrepresentation involving univariate polynomials. This work is carried out\nnumerically on input-output data generated by a Bouc-Wen hysteretic model and\nfollows up on earlier work of the authors. The current article discusses the\npolynomial decoupling approach and explores the selection of the number of\nunivariate polynomials with the polynomial degree, as well as the connections\nwith neural network modeling. We have found that the presented decoupling\napproach is able to reduce the number of parameters of the full nonlinear model\nup to about 50\\%, while maintaining a comparable output error level.\n",

However, despite their widespread use,\ngraph filters have been analyzed only in the deterministic setting, ignoring\nthe impact of stochastic- ity in both the graph topology as well as the signal\nitself. To bridge this gap, we examine the statistical behavior of the two key\nfilter types, finite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average\n(ARMA) graph filters, when operating on random time- varying graph signals (or\nrandom graph processes) over random time-varying graphs. Our analysis shows\nthat (i) in expectation, the filters behave as the same deterministic filters\noperating on a deterministic graph, being the expected graph, having as input\nsignal a deterministic signal, being the expected signal, and (ii) there are\nmeaningful upper bounds for the variance of the filter output. We conclude the\npaper by proposing two novel ways of exploiting randomness to improve (joint\ngraph-time) noise cancellation, as well as to reduce the computational\ncomplexity of graph filtering. As demonstrated by numerical results, these\nmethods outperform the disjoint average and denoise algorithm, and yield a (up\nto) four times complexity redution, with very little difference from the\noptimal solution.\n",

The main idea is to\napproximate a large-scale Markov chain by a compact set of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs). Even though it is often crucial for a fluid\nmodel under study to satisfy some given properties, a formal verification is\nusually challenging. This is because parameters are often not known precisely\ndue to finite-precision measurements and stochastic noise. In this paper, we\npresent a novel technique that allows one to efficiently compute formal bounds\non the reachable set of time-varying nonlinear ODE systems that are subject to\nuncertainty. To this end, we a) relate the reachable set of a nonlinear fluid\nmodel to a family of inhomogeneous continuous time Markov decision processes\nand b) provide optimal and suboptimal solutions for the family by relying on\noptimal control theory. The proposed technique is efficient and can be expected\nto provide tight bounds. We demonstrate its potential by comparing it with a\nstate-of-the-art over-approximation approach.\n",

It has been shown, in our previous work, that the GNSS\nerror can be reduced from several meters to sub-meter level by matching the\nbiased GNSS positioning to a digital map with road constraints. While further\nerror reduction is expected by increasing the number of participating vehicles,\nfundamental questions on how the vehicle membership within CMM affects the\nperformance of the CMM results need to be addressed to provide guidelines for\ndesign and optimization of the vehicle network. This work presents a\ntheoretical study that establishes a framework for quantitative evaluation of\nthe impact of the road constraints on the CMM accuracy. More specifically, a\nclosed-form expression of the CMM error in terms of the road constraints and\nGNSS error is derived based on a simple CMM rule. The asymptotic decay of the\nCMM error as the number of vehicles increases is established and justified\nthrough numerical simulations. Moreover, it is proved that the CMM error can be\nminimized if the directions of the roads on which the connected vehicles travel\nobey a uniform distribution. Finally, the localization accuracy of CMM is\nevaluated based on the Safety Pilot Model Deployment and Pillar dataset of Ann\nArbor traffic flow collected over three years period.

We present a optimization based method for approximating\nthe stochastic reachable set for human-in-the-loop systems.

This tool provides set predictions\nconsisting of trajectories observed from the nonlinear dynamics and behaviors\nof the human driven car, and can account for modes of behavior, like the driver\nstate or intent. This allows us to predict driving behavior over long time\nhorizons with high accuracy.

MMC is a converter system with a typical multi-frequency response due\nto its significant steady-state harmonic components in the arm currents,\ncapacitor voltages, and control signals. Therefore, traditional small-signal\nmodeling methods for 2-level voltage-source converters (VSCs) cannot be\ndirectly applied to the MMC. In this paper, the harmonic state-space (HSS)\nmodeling approach is introduced to characterize the harmonic coupling behavior\nof the MMC.

Furthermore, in order to reveal the impact of the\ninternal dynamics and closed-loop control on the small-signal impedance of the\nMMC, three cases are considered in this paper, i.e., open-loop control, ac\nvoltage closed-loop control, and circulating current closed-loop control.\nFinally, the analytical impedance models are verified by both simulation and\nexperimental results.\n",

To\nenhance the dependability of industrial wireless control, we propose a holistic\ncyber-physical management framework that employs run-time coordination between\nthe plant control and network management. Our design includes a holistic\ncontroller that generates actuation signals to physical plants and reconfigures\nthe WSAN to maintain desired control performance while saving wireless\nresources. As a concrete example of holistic control, we design a holistic\nmanager that dynamically reconfigures the number of transmissions in the WSAN\nbased on online observations of physical and cyber variables. We have\nimplemented the holistic management framework in the Wireless Cyber-Physical\nSimulator (WCPS). A systematic case study has been presented based on two\n5-state plants sharing a 16-node WSAN. Simulation results show that the\nholistic management design has significantly enhanced the resilience of the\nsystem against both wireless interferences and physical disturbances, while\neffectively reducing the number of wireless transmissions.\n",

Therefore, to understand the various factors affecting the\nenergy usage, and to optimize the operational efficiency of building HVAC\nsystems, energy analysts and architects often create simulations (e.g.,\nEnergyPlus or DOE-2), of buildings prior to construction or renovation to\ndetermine energy savings and quantify the Return-on-Investment (ROI). While\nuseful, these simulations usually use static HVAC control strategies such as\nlowering room temperature at night, or reactive control based on simulated room\noccupancy. Recently, advances have been made in HVAC control algorithms that\npredict room occupancy. However, these algorithms depend on costly sensor\ninstallations and the tradeoffs between predictive accuracy, energy savings,\ncomfort and expenses are not well understood. Current simulation frameworks do\nnot support easy analysis of these tradeoffs.

The classification principle is\nused to classify the decision variables of a BMI problem into two categories:\n1) external and 2) internal variables. Theoretical analysis is performed to\nshow that when the classification principle is applicable, a BMI problem can be\ntransformed into an unconstrained optimization problem that has fewer decision\nvariables. Stochastic search and deterministic search are then applied to\ndetermine the decision variables of the unconstrained problem externally and\nexplore the internal problem structure, respectively. The proposed method can\naddress feasibility, single-objective, and multiobjective problems constrained\nby BMIs in a unified manner.

This system, which we call the VehSense, gathers\ndata from smartphone inertial sensors and vehicle wheel speed sensors, and\nprocesses the data to monitor slippery road conditions in real-time.\nSpecifically, two speed readings are collected: 1) ground speed, which is\nestimated by vehicle acceleration and rotation, and 2) wheel speed, which is\nretrieved from the OBD-II interface. The mismatch between these two speeds is\nused to infer a skidding event. Without tapping into vehicle manufactures'\nproprietary data (e.g., antilock braking system), VehSense is compatible with\nmost of the passenger vehicles, and thus can be easily deployed. We evaluate\nour system on snow-covered roads at Buffalo, and show that it can detect\nvehicle skidding effectively.\n",

        "summary": "  Accurately monitoring the system's operating point is central to the reliable\nand economic operation of an electric power grid. Power system state estimation\n(PSSE) aims to obtain complete voltage magnitude and angle information at each\nbus given a number of system variables at selected buses and lines. Power flow\nanalysis is a special case of PSSE, and amounts to solving a set of noise-free\npower flow equations. Physical laws dictate quadratic relationships between\navailable quantities and unknown voltages, rendering general instances of power\nflow and PSSE nonconvex and NP-hard. Past approaches are largely based on\ngradient-type iterative procedures or semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Due to\nnonconvexity, the solution obtained via gradient-type schemes depends on\ninitialization, while SDR methods do not perform as desired in challenging\nscenarios. This paper puts forth novel \\emph{feasible point pursuit}\n(FPP)-based solvers for power flow and PSSE, which iteratively seek feasible\nsolutions for a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming\n(QCQP) reformulation of the weighted least-squares (WLS) problem. Relative to\nthe prior art, the developed solvers offer superior performance at the cost of\nhigher complexity. Furthermore, they converge to a stationary point of the WLS\nproblem. As a baseline for comparing different estimators, the Cram{\\' e}r-Rao\nlower bound (CRLB) is derived for the fundamental PSSE problem in this paper.\nJudicious numerical tests on several IEEE benchmark systems showcase markedly\nimproved performance of our FPP-based solvers for both power flow and PSSE\ntasks over popular WLS-based Gauss-Newton iterations and SDR approaches.\n",

Truck platooning is a\npromising technology that allows heavy vehicles to save fuel by driving with\nsmall automatically controlled inter-vehicle distances. In order to leverage\nthe full potential of platooning, platoons can be formed dynamically en route\nby small adjustments to their speeds.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool for\nanalyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied to\nseveral small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability\nto large scale systems is often intractable because of its\nexponentially-scaling computation complexity with respect to system dimension,\nalso known as the \"curse of dimensionality\". To overcome this problem, the\nsequential path planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to\nvehicles, was previously proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be\ndone with a linearly-scaling computation complexity. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the potential of SPP algorithm for large-scale systems. In\nparticular, we simulate large-scale multi-vehicle systems in two different\nurban environments, a city environment and a multi-city environment, and use\nthe SPP algorithm for trajectory planning. SPP is able to efficiently design\ncollision-free trajectories in both environments despite the presence of\ndisturbances in vehicles' dynamics. To ensure a safe transition of vehicles to\ntheir destinations, our method automatically allocates space-time reservations\nto vehicles while accounting for the magnitude of disturbances such as wind in\na provably safe way.

Advances in Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) makes it possible\nto use the information from geographical distant location to improve power\nsystem dynamics and performances. A speed deviation based Wide-Area Power\nSystem Stabilizer (WAPSS) is known to be effective in damping inter-area modes.\nHowever, the involvement of wide-area signals gives rise to the problem of\ntime-delay, which may degrade the system performance. In general, time-stamped\nsynchronized signals from Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) are used for WAPSS, in\nwhich delays are introduced in both local and remote signals. One can opt for a\nfeedback of remote signal only from PDC and uses the local signal as it is\navailable, without time synchronization. This paper utilizes configurations of\ntime-matched synchronized and nonsychronized feedback and provides the\nguidelines to design the controller. The controllers are synthesized using\n$H_\\infty$ control with regional pole placement for ensuring adequate dynamic\nperformance. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, two power\nsystem models have been used for the simulations.

However, such tools depend on system\ntopology and line parameters, which may be missing or inaccurate in\ndistribution grids. With abundant data, one idea is to use linear regression to\nfind line parameters, based on which topology can be identified. Unfortunately,\nthe linear regression method is accurate only if there is no noise in both the\ninput measurements (e.g., voltage magnitude and phase angle) and output\nmeasurements (e.g., active and reactive power). For topology estimation, even\nwith a small error in measurements, the regression-based method is incapable of\nfinding the topology using non-zero line parameters with a proper metric. To\nmodel input and output measurement errors simultaneously, we propose the\nerror-in-variables (EIV) model in a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)\nframework for joint line parameter and topology estimation. While directly\nsolving the problem is NP-hard, we successfully adapt the problem into a\ngeneralized low-rank approximation problem via variable transformation and\nnoise decorrelation. For accurate topology estimation, we let it interact with\nparameter estimation in a fashion that is similar to expectation-maximization\nfashion in machine learning. The proposed PaToPa approach does not require a\nradial network setting and works for mesh networks. We demonstrate the superior\nperformance in accuracy for our method on IEEE test cases with actual feeder\ndata from South California Edison.\n",

The idea is to assign sensors to measure states such that\nthe global cost is minimized. The number and selection of sensor measurements\nneed to ensure the observability to track the dynamic state of the system with\nbounded estimation error. The main question we address is how to select the\nstate measurements to minimize the cost while satisfying the observability\nconditions. Relaxing the observability condition for structurally cyclic\nsystems, the main contribution is to propose a graph theoretic approach to\nsolve the problem in polynomial time.

Detailed descriptions are given of a source detection procedure\nbased on this developed representation, and the method's effectiveness is\nconfirmed by simulations on the recommended testbeds (eg.

However, a too flexible noise model (i.e., too many parameters)\nincreases the model complexity, which can cause additional numerical problems\nfor PEM. In this paper, we consider the weighted null-space fitting (WNSF)\nmethod. With this method, the system is first modeled using a non-parametric\nARX model, which is then reduced to a parametric model of interest using\nweighted least squares. In the reduction step, a parametric noise model does\nnot need to be estimated if it is not of interest.

In this paper, we prove these results, and we derive the asymptotic\ncovariance for the estimation error obtained in closed loop, which is optimal\nfor an infinite-order noise model.

With this in mind, we designed and\nimplemented an occupancy-predictive HVAC control system in a low-cost yet\npowerful embedded system (using Raspberry Pi 3) to demonstrate the following\nkey features for building automation: (1) real-time occupancy recognition using\nvideo-processing and machine-learning techniques, (2) dynamic analysis and\nprediction of occupancy patterns, and (3) model predictive control for HVAC\noperations guided by real-time building thermal response simulations (using an\non-board EnergyPlus simulator). We deployed and evaluated our system for\nproviding automatic HVAC control in the large public indoor space of a mosque,\nthereby achieving significant energy savings.\n",

In this paper, we consider in the time domain\nthe input design problem of KRMs for LTI system identification. Different from\nthe recent result, we adopt a Bayesian perspective and in particular make use\nof scalar measures (e.g., the $A$-optimality, $D$-optimality, and\n$E$-optimality) of the Bayesian mean square error matrix as the design criteria\nsubject to power-constraint on the input. Instead to solve the optimization\nproblem directly, we propose a two-step procedure. In the first step, by making\nsuitable assumptions on the unknown input, we construct a quadratic map\n(transformation) of the input such that the transformed input design problems\nare convex, the number of optimization variables is independent of the number\nof input data, and their global minima can be found efficiently by applying\nwell-developed convex optimization software packages. In the second step, we\nderive the expression of the optimal input based on the global minima found in\nthe first step by solving the inverse image of the quadratic map. In addition,\nwe derive analytic results for some special types of fixed kernels, which\nprovide insights on the input design and also its dependence on the kernel\nstructure.\n",

The least-absolute-value (LAV) estimator is known for\nits robustness relative to the weighted least-squares (WLS) one. However, due\nto nonconvexity and nonsmoothness, existing LAV solvers based on linear\nprogramming are typically slow, hence inadequate for real-time system\nmonitoring. This paper develops two novel algorithms for efficient LAV\nestimation, which draw from recent advances in composite optimization. The\nfirst is a deterministic linear proximal scheme that handles a sequence of\nconvex quadratic problems, each efficiently solvable either via off-the-shelf\nalgorithms or through the alternating direction method of multipliers.\nLeveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to power networks, the second\nscheme is stochastic, and updates only \\emph{a few} entries of the complex\nvoltage state vector per iteration. In particular, when voltage magnitude and\n(re)active power flow measurements are used only, this number reduces to one or\ntwo, \\emph{regardless of} the number of buses in the network. This\ncomputational complexity evidently scales well to large-size power systems.\nFurthermore, by carefully \\emph{mini-batching} the voltage and power flow\nmeasurements, accelerated implementation of the stochastic iterations becomes\npossible. The developed algorithms are numerically evaluated using a variety of\nbenchmark power networks. Simulated tests corroborate that improved robustness\ncan be attained at comparable or markedly reduced computation times for medium-\nor large-size networks relative to the \"workhorse\" WLS-based Gauss-Newton\niterations.\n",

Meanwhile, convex\nrelaxed power flow equations are also prerequisites for efficiently solving a\nwide range of problems in power systems including mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogramming (MINLP) and distributed optimization. When the exactness of convex\nrelaxations is not guaranteed, it is important to recover a feasible solution\nfor the convex relaxation methods. This paper presents an alternative convex\noptimization (ACP) approach that can efficiently recover a feasible solution\nfrom the result of second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxed OPF in mesh\nnetworks. The OPF problem is first formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC)\nprogramming problem, then efficiently solved by a penalty convex concave\nprocedure (CCP). CCP iteratively linearizes the concave parts of the power flow\nconstraints and solves a convex approximation of the DCP problem. Numerical\ntests show that the proposed method can find a global or near-global optimal\nsolution to the AC OPF problem, and outperforms those semidefinite programming\n(SDP) based algorithms.\n",

        "summary": "  Disturbance noises are always bounded in a practical system, while fusion\nestimation is to best utilize multiple sensor data containing noises for the\npurpose of estimating a quantity--a parameter or process. However, few results\nare focused on the information fusion estimation problem under bounded noises.\nIn this paper, we study the distributed fusion estimation problem for linear\ntime-varying systems and nonlinear systems with bounded noises, where the\naddressed noises do not provide any statistical information, and are unknown\nbut bounded. When considering linear time-varying fusion systems with bounded\nnoises, a new local Kalman-like estimator is designed such that the square\nerror of the estimator is bounded as time goes to $\\infty$. A novel\nconstructive method is proposed to find an upper bound of fusion estimation\nerror, then a convex optimization problem on the design of an optimal weighting\nfusion criterion is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which\ncan be solved by standard software packages. Furthermore, according to the\ndesign method of linear time-varying fusion systems, each local nonlinear\nestimator is derived for nonlinear systems with bounded noises by using Taylor\nseries expansion, and a corresponding distributed fusion criterion is obtained\nby solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, target tracking system and\nlocalization of a mobile robot are given to show the advantages and\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.\n",

In this paper, we propose\natomic-norm-based methods for mmWave FD-MIMO channel estimation under both\nuniform planar arrays (UPA) and non-uniform planar arrays (NUPA). Unlike\nexisting algorithms such as compressive sensing (CS) or subspace methods, the\natomic-norm-based algorithms do not require to discretize the angle spaces of\nthe angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) into grids, thus\nprovide much better accuracy in estimation. In the UPA case, to reduce the\ncomputational complexity, the original large-scale 4D atomic norm minimization\nproblem is approximately reformulated as a semi-definite program (SDP)\ncontaining two decoupled two-level Toeplitz matrices. The SDP is then solved\nvia the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where each iteration\ninvolves only closed-form computations. In the NUPA case, the atomic-norm-based\nformulation for channel estimation becomes nonconvex and a\ngradient-decent-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed algorithms achieve better performance than the\nCS-based and subspace-based algorithms.\n",

This kind of scenario can arise, for instance, when quadcopters\nsearch a collapsed building after a natural disaster. Choosing the quadcopter\nas the target platform, this paper proposes the Kinodynamic Aggressive\nTrajectory (KAT) motion planning algorithm, which aims to compute aggressive\ntrajectories for narrow passages under nonholonomic constraints. This type of\nmaneuvers is necessary because the dynamics of quadcopters entail that some\nnarrow passages can only be traversed at high speed.\n  To find the best path, the KAT uses RRT to determine a holonomic path first\nand then adjusts it to satisfy the nonholonomic constraints. The innovations in\nthis process are: 1) The states of the robot are divided into near-holonomic\nset and non-holonomic set, which makes the constraints local rather than\nglobal; 2) For each of the most confined waypoints in the path, KAT plans\nforward and backward simultaneously around the waypoint to find a feasible\nlocal trajectory traversing the narrow passage. Our approach thus transforms a\nglobally-constrained planning problem into a problem with local constraints,\nand as a result, the computation becomes tractable. We evaluate KAT by applying\nit to a quadcopter flying through two inclined holes that require aggressive\nmaneuvers in a simulated environment. The average computation time to\nsuccessfully find a solution for passing two 50 degree inclined holes is around\n32 seconds.\n",

The use of\nvariable-pitch propeller for thrust variation instead of RPM regulation\nfacilitates generation of negative thrust, thereby augmenting the rate of\nchange of thrust generation amenable for aggressive maneuvering. Blade element\ntheory along with momentum theory is used to estimate propeller thrust and\ntorque essential for formulating equation of motion of the vehicle. The\nproposed flight dynamics model is used for non-linear control design using\ndynamic inversion technique, which is then used to stabilize, track reference\ntrajectory, and simulate flip maneuver. The rotor torque is an irrational\nfunction of the control input which makes the control design challenging. To\naddress this problem, the control design employs three loops. The outer loop\nsolves the translational dynamics to generate the thrust, pitch angle, and roll\nangle commands required to track the prescribed trajectory. Using the command\ngenerated in the outer loop, the inner loop simplifies the rotational dynamics\nto provide the desired rate of angular velocities. A control allocation loop is\nadded to address the problem of nonlinearity associated with rotor torque. This\nis done by introducing the derivative of thrust coefficient as a virtual\ncontrol input. These virtual inputs determine the derivatives of thrust and\nbody moments, which in turn is used to generate the required thrust and body\nmoments. The concept is validated by showing attitude stabilization in real\nflight for a variable pitch quadrotor. The performance of the proposed design\nis shown through simulated results for attitude stabilization and trajectory\nfollowing. Reverse thrust capability of variable-pitch quadrotor is also shown\nby performing flip maneuver in which quadrotor roll angle changes from 0 to 180\ndegrees.\n",

Given a small number of stochastic\nsimulations, the proposed framework constructs a GP regression model and\npredicts the system's performance over the entire set of possible\nuncertainties. Included in the framework is a new metric to estimate the\nconfidence in those predictions based on the variance of the GP's cumulative\ndistribution function. This variance-based metric forms the basis of active\nsampling algorithms that aim to minimize prediction error through careful\nselection of simulations. In three case studies, the new active sampling\nalgorithms demonstrate up to a 35% improvement in prediction error over other\napproaches and are able to correctly identify regions with low prediction\nconfidence through the variance metric.\n",

To mitigate\nthis problem we present a simulation-based approach where we first sample a\nnumber of trajectories of the system and next establish bounds on the\nconvergence or divergence between the samples and neighboring trajectories. We\ncompute these bounds using contraction theory and reduce the conservatism by\npartitioning the state vector into several components and analyzing contraction\nproperties separately in each direction. Among other benefits this allows us to\nanalyze the effect of constant but uncertain parameters by treating them as\nstate variables and partitioning them into a separate direction.

However, speed limit changes frequently throughout the transportation\nnetwork, due to either safety-related considerations (e.g., workzone\noperations) or congestion management schemes (e.g., speed harmonization\nsystems). These abrupt changes in speed limit can result in shock- wave\nformation and cause travel time unreliability. Therefore, designing a\nplatooning strategy for tracking a reference velocity profile is critical to\nenabling end-to-end platooning. Accordingly, this study introduces a\ngeneralized control model to track a desired velocity profile, while ensuring\nsafety in the platoon of autonomous vehicles. We define appropriate natural\nerror terms and the target curve in the state space of the control system,\nwhich is the set of points where all error terms vanish and corresponds to the\ncase when all vehicles move with the desired velocities and in the minimum safe\ndistance between them. In this way, we change the tracking velocity profile\nproblem into a state- feedback stabilization problem with respect to the target\ncurve. Under certain mild assumptions on the Lipschitz constant of the speed\ndrop profile, we show that the stabilizing feedback can be obtained via\nintroducing a natural dynamics for the maximum of the error terms for each\nvehicle. Moreover, we show that with this stabilizing feedback collisions will\nnot occur if the initial state of the system of vehicles is sufficiently close\nto the target curve. We also show that the error terms remain bounded\nthroughout the time and space. Two scenarios were simulated, with and without\ninitial perturbations, and results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed\ncontrol model in tracking the speed drop while ensuring safety and string\nstability.\n",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by\nconstructing an abstraction (totally 4 dimensions) of the interconnection of\nfour discrete-time linear stochastic control subsystems (together 100\ndimensions) in a compositional fashion.\n",

We derive a\nlinear power flow approximation and consider a convex reformulation of the\npower losses in the form of absolute value functions. We show four ways how to\nincorporate this approximation into LP/QP based OPF problems. In a\ncomprehensive case study the usefulness of our OPF methods is analyzed and\ncompared with an existing OPF relaxation and approximation method. As a result,\nthe errors on voltage magnitudes and angles are reasonable, while obtaining\nnear-optimal results for typical scenarios.

While total loss of thrust trajectories to\nnearby airports can be pre-computed for all initial points in a 3D flight plan,\ndynamic aspects such as partial power and airplane surface damage must be\nconsidered for accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new Dynamic Data-Driven\nAvionics Software (DDDAS) approach which during flight updates a damaged\naircraft performance model, used in turn to generate plausible flight\ntrajectories to a safe landing site. Our damaged aircraft model is\nparameterized on a baseline glide ratio for a clean aircraft configuration\nassuming best gliding airspeed on straight flight. The model predicts purely\ngeometric criteria for flight trajectory generation, namely, glide ratio and\nturn radius for different bank angles and drag configurations. Given actual\naircraft performance data, we dynamically infer the baseline glide ratio to\nupdate the damaged aircraft model. Our new flight trajectory generation\nalgorithm thus can significantly improve upon prior Dubins based trajectory\ngeneration work by considering these data-driven geometric criteria. We further\nintroduce a trajectory utility function to rank trajectories for safety. As a\nuse case, we consider the Hudson River ditching of US Airways 1549 in January\n2009 using a flight simulator to evaluate our trajectories and to get sensor\ndata. In this case, a baseline glide ratio of 17.25:1 enabled us to generate\ntrajectories up to 28 seconds after the birds strike, whereas, a 19:1 baseline\nglide ratio enabled us to generate trajectories up to 36 seconds after the\nbirds strike. DDDAS can significantly improve the accuracy of generated flight\ntrajectories thereby enabling better decision support systems for pilots in\nemergency conditions.\n",

Optimal\ncontrol functions are obtained in both time and frequency domains, and a\ndiscrete-time solution suitable for periodic feedback control systems is\npresented.

The second family of resets is\ngenerally-distributed, in the sense that, the time intervals between events are\nindependent and identically distributed random variables that follow an\narbitrary continuous positively-valued probability density function. For this\nclass of stochastic systems, we provide explicit conditions that lead to finite\nstationary moments, and the corresponding exact closed-form moment formulas.\nThese results are illustrated on an example drawn from systems biology, where a\nprotein is expressed in bursts at exponentially-distributed time intervals,\ndecays within the cell-cycle, and is randomly divided among daughter cells when\ngenerally-distributed cell-division events occur. Our analysis leads to novel\nresults for the mean and noise levels in protein copy numbers, and we decompose\nthe noise levels into components arising from stochastic expression, random\ncell-cycle times, and partitioning.

Firstly, it is shown that a\nnetworked Kalman filter with optimal gain parameter is actually a centralized\nfilter, since it requires each sensor to have global information which is\nusually forbidden in large networks. Then, a sub-optimal distributed Kalman\nfilter (DKF) is proposed by employing the covariance intersection (CI) fusion\nstrategy. It is proven that the proposed DKF is of consistency, that is, the\nupper bound of error covariance matrix can be provided by the filter in real\ntime. The consistency also enables the design of adaptive CI weights for better\nfilter precision. Furthermore, the boundedness of covariance matrix and the\nconvergence of the proposed filter are proven based on the strong connectivity\nof directed network topology and the global observability which permits the\nsub-system with local sensor's measurements to be unobservable. Meanwhile, to\nkeep the covariance of the estimation error bounded, the proposed DKF does not\nrequire the system matrix to be nonsingular at each moment, which seems to be a\nnecessary condition in the main DKF designs under global observability.\nFinally, simulation results of two examples show the effectiveness of the\nalgorithm in the considered scenarios.\n",

This allows the controller to aim for the\nbenefits of exact model knowledge while simultaneously remaining robust to\nmodel uncertainty.\n  Like most nonlinear controllers, adaptive controllers are often designed and\nanalyzed under the assumption of deterministic full state feedback. However,\ndoing so inherently decouples the adaptive update mechanism from the\nprobabilistic information provided by modern state observers.\n  The simplest way to reconcile this is to let the observer produce both state\nestimates and model parameter estimates, so that all probabilistic information\nis shared within the framework of the observer. While this technique is\nbecoming increasingly common, it is still not widely accepted due to a lack of\ngeneral closed-loop stability proofs.\n  In this thesis, we will investigate observer-side parameter estimation for\nadaptive control by precisely juxtaposing its mechanics against the current,\nwidely accepted adaptive control designs. Additionally, we will propose a new\ntechnique that increases the robustness of observer-based adaptive control by\nfollowing the same line of reasoning used for the popular concurrent learning\nmethod.\n",

We connect two\nperformance measures that are well studied, but appear to be unrelated. The\nfirst measure is concerned with energy metrics, namely the $\\Hcal_2$--norm of a\nnetwork, which arises in control theory applications. The second measure is\nconcerned with the notion of \"tail risk\" which arises in economic and financial\nnetworks. We study the question of why such performance measures may\ndeteriorate at a faster rate than the growth rate of the network. We first\nfocus on the energy metric and its well known connection to controllability\nGramian of the underlying dynamical system. We show that undirected networks\nexhibit the most graceful energy growth rates as network size grows. This rate\nis quantified completely by the proximity of spectral radius to unity or\ndistance to instability. In contrast, we show that the simple characterization\nof energy in terms of network spectrum does not exist for directed networks. We\ndemonstrate that, for any fixed distance to instability, energy of a directed\nnetwork can grow at an exponentially faster rate. We provide general methods\nfor manipulating networks to reduce energy. In particular, we prove that\ncertain operations that increase the symmetry in a network cannot increase\nenergy (in an order sense). Secondly, we focus on tail risk in economic and\nfinancial networks. In contrast to $\\Hcal_2$--norm which arises from computing\nthe expectation of energy in the network, tail risk focuses on tail probability\nbehavior of network variables. Although the two measures differ substantially\nwe show that they are precisely connected through the system Gramian. This\nsurprising result explains why topology considerations rather than specific\nperformance measures dictate the large scale behavior of networks.\n",

With the converter interface, the rotor inertia\nof doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine generator is\neffectively decoupled from the system, causing a reduction in inertial\nresponse. This can be compensated by enabling the DFIG to provide fast\nfrequency response. This paper proposes a quantitative control approach for\nDFIG to deliver fast frequency response in the inertial response time scale. A\nsupplementary power surge function is added to the active power reference of\nDFIG. The exact amount of power surge that is available from DFIG-based wind\nturbine is quantified based on estimation of maximum extractable energy.\nMoreover, the operational constraints such as rotor limits and converter\nover-load limit are considered at the same time. Thus, the proposed approach\nnot only provides adequate inertial response but also ensures the rotor speed\nis kept within a specified operating range. Rotor safety is guaranteed without\nthe need for an additional rotor speed protection scheme.\n",

Numerical\ntests confirm that, relative to a typical decomposition method, the proposed\nmethod does not only enjoy a cheaper computational cost but is workable even\nwhen the objectives of the TSO and the DSO(s) are in distinct scales.\n",

For instance, in power flow study, state estimation, and voltage\nstability assessment, the use of admittance parameters (i.e., the nodal\nadmittance matrix) and hybrid parameters is common. Moreover, network reduction\ntechniques (e.g., Kron reduction) are often applied to decrease the size of\nlarge grid models (i.e., with hundreds or thousands of state variables),\nthereby alleviating the computational burden. However, researchers normally\ndisregard the fact that the applicability of these methods is not generally\nguaranteed. In reality, the nodal admittance must satisfy certain properties in\norder for hybrid parameters to exist and Kron reduction to be feasible.\nRecently, this problem was solved for the particular cases of monophase and\nbalanced triphase grids. This paper investigates the general case of unbalanced\npolyphase grids. Firstly, conditions determining the rank of the so-called\ncompound nodal admittance matrix and its diagonal subblocks are deduced from\nthe characteristics of the electrical components and the network graph.\nSecondly, the implications of these findings concerning the feasibility of Kron\nreduction and the existence of hybrid parameters are discussed. In this regard,\nthis paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for various applications\nin power system analysis\n",

With interconnections among multiple\nLAPPNs, power dispatching can be further extended to intra- and inter-LAPPN\npower interchanges. It becomes a significant issue to schedule the two kinds of\npower interchanges as, from a system perspective high utilization of available\nscheduling time slots and low overall transmission loss should be guaranteed,\nand from a subscriber perspective a high scheduled ratio of transmission\nrequests with a fair transmission sequence in terms of transmission urgency are\nexpected. To this end, we propose a cooperative power dispatching framework for\nconnected LAPPNs, including subscriber matching and two-layer power\ntransmission scheduling. The former matches subscribers from different LAPPNs,\nconsidering both subscriber preferences and power transmission loss. The latter\ncoordinates the intra- and inter-LAPPN power packet transmission to maximize\nthe amount of energy delivered with a guaranteed fairness on user urgency.\nSimulation results of a two-LAPPN system are provided, which demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework can achieve effective and efficient power dispatching in\nterms of the mentioned concerns, and reveal facts on ideal system capacity and\nhow to manipulate the proportions of the two kinds of transmissions according\nto network status.\n",

In mechatronics, the same design corresponds to shaping input\nsignals to damp residual vibrations in flexible structures. More generally, in\nmost applications, the aim of PWM design is to minimize the total harmonic\ndistortion while adhering to a prescribed harmonic content.

This objective is\nachieved within an arbitrarily small bound of the optimal solution.

Next, the biplane wings are designed using simple lifting line\ntheory. The airframe design is followed by power plant selection and\ntransmission design. Finally, weight estimation is carried out to complete the\ndesign process.

The operating RPM of the proprotors is reduced from\n3200 during hover to 2000 during forward flight to ensure optimal performance\nduring cruise flight.

The active damping strategy is designed to reduce the\ndegrading impact on maneuvering and pointing performance via a force feedback\nstrategy. Many problems have been encountered until now, such as instability of\nthe closed loop system, excessive consumption in the attitude propellant or\nproblems for engine re-ignition in upper stages. Mostly, they have been\naddressed in a passive way via the design of baffles and membranes, which on\ntheir own have mass and constructive impacts. Active management of propellant\nmotion in launchers and satellites has the potential to increase performance on\nvarious levels. This paper demonstrates active slosh management using force\nfeedback for the compensation of the slosh resonances. Force sensors between\ntank and the carrying structure provide information of the fluid motion via the\nreaction force. The control system is designed to generate an appropriate\nacceleration profile that leads to desired attenuation profiles in amplitude,\nfrequency and time. Two robust control design methods, one based on $\\mu$\ndesign and the other on parametric structured design based on non-smooth\noptimization of the worst-case $H_{\\infty}$ norm, are applied. The controller\nis first tested with a computational fluid dynamics simulation in the loop.\nFinally a water tank mounted on a Hexapod with up to $1100$ liter is used to\nevaluate the control performance.

Through transforming the MEPDE to the\nfinite-dimensional Initial-value Problem (IVP) with the semi-discrete method,\nthe OCPs may be solved with common Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\nnumerical integration methods. Illustrative examples are presented to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

The proposed approach uses the interconnection matrix and joint\ndissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their abstractions described by\na new notion of so-called stochastic storage functions. The interconnected\nabstraction framework is based on new notions of so-called stochastic\nsimulation functions, using which one can quantify the distance between\noriginal interconnected stochastic control systems and interconnected\nabstractions in the probabilistic setting. In the first part of the paper, we\nderive dissipativity-type compositional reasoning for the quantification of the\ndistance in probability between the interconnection of stochastic control\nsubsystems and that of their abstractions. Moreover, we focus on a class of\ndiscrete-time nonlinear stochastic control systems with independent noises in\nthe abstract and concrete subsystems, and propose a computational scheme to\nconstruct abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic storage\nfunctions. In the second part of the paper, we consider specifications\nexpressed as syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic formulae and show how\na synthesized policy for the abstract system can be refined to a policy for the\noriginal system while providing guarantee on the probability of satisfaction.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by constructing an\nabstraction (totally 3 dimensions) of the interconnection of three\ndiscrete-time nonlinear stochastic control subsystems (together 222 dimensions)\nin a compositional fashion. We also employ the abstraction as a substitute to\nsynthesize a controller enforcing a syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic\nspecification.\n",

In this work, a new evolving and\nself-organizing controller namely Generic-controller, G-controller, is\nproposed. The G-controller that works in the fully online mode with very minor\nexpert domain knowledge is developed by incorporating the sliding model\ncontrol, SMC, theory based learning algorithm with an advanced incremental\nlearning machine namely Generic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System ,\nGENEFIS. The controller starts operating from scratch with an empty set of\nfuzzy rules, and therefore, no offline training is required.

Control law and adaptation laws for the consequents are derived from\nthe SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability\nof the G-controller is guaranteed using the Lyapunov function. The uniform\nasymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero is witnessed through the\nimplication of an auxiliary robustifying control term.

Accurate models for\nwind energy conversion systems (WECSs) are of key interest for the analysis and\ncontrol design of present and future energy systems. Existing control-oriented\nWECSs models are subject to unstructured simplifications, which have not been\ndiscussed in literature so far. Thus, this technical note presents are thorough\nderivation of a physical state-space model for permanent magnet synchronous\ngenerator WECSs. The physical model considers all dynamic effects that\nsignificantly influence the system's power output, including the switching of\nthe power electronics. Alternatively, the model is formulated in the $(a,b,c)$-\nand $(d,q)$-reference frame. Secondly, a complete control and operation\nmanagement system for the wind regimes II and III and the transition between\nthe regimes is presented. The control takes practical effects such as input\nsaturation and integral windup into account. Thirdly, by a structured model\nreduction procedure, two state-space models of WECS with reduced complexity are\nderived: a non-switching model and a non-switching reduced-order model.

We show in the paper that when the intersection of the\nintervals imposed by the agents is nonempty, the resulting constrained\nconsensus problem must converge to a common value inside that intersection. In\nour algorithm, convergence happens in a fully distributed manner, and without\nneed of sharing any information on the individual constraining intervals. When\nthe intersection of the intervals is an empty set, the intrinsic nonlinearity\nof the network dynamics raises new challenges in understanding the node state\nevolution. Using Brouwer fixed-point theorem we prove that in that case there\nexists at least one equilibrium, and in fact the possible equilibria are\nlocally stable if the constraints are satisfied or dissatisfied at the same\ntime among all nodes. For graphs with sufficient sparsity it is further proven\nthat there is a unique equilibrium that is globally attractive if the\nconstraint intervals are pairwise disjoint.\n",

Although capacity expansion\nhad been traditionally well noticed as a congestion mitigation measure, but it\nwas not until recently that capacity reduction measures such as; congestion\npricing, road diet and other such capacity reduction measures were noticed as\ncongestion mitigation measures. Measures such as signal optimization, metering\nand congestion pricing are intended to affect the travel pattern and assignment\nbehavior of travelers to make the results of the User Equilibrium (UE) traffic\nassignment, followed by the travelers, closer to the System Optimal (SO)\noutcomes, intended by the planners. As such, a bi-level optimization model was\nformulated for the simultaneous optimization of capacity improvement/expansion\nand signal timing in an urban transportation network. The model takes into\naccount both the effect of higher demand, induced by the capacity expansion,\nand the rerouting potential effect of traffic signals. The solution algorithm\ndeveloped here consists of two major components; the gradient projection\nalgorithm (GP) to solve the lower level traffic assignment problem and the\nSimulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to solve the master problem. In order to\nillustrate the method a case study was examined. The analysis and application\nof the proposed algorithm shows that the performance function gradually\nconverged along the simulation run, and no divergence problem is observed.

This method is based on a\ngeneral-purpose transmis-sion-distribution coordination model called G-TDCM,\nwhich thus enables the G-MSS to be applicable to most of the central functions\nof the TDCEM. In this G-MSS method, a basic heter-ogenous decomposition (HGD)\nalgorithm is first derived from the HGD of the coupling constraints in the\noptimality conditions of the G-TDCM. Its optimality and convergence properties\nare then proved. Further, inspired by the conditions for conver-gence, a\nmodified HGD algorithm that utilizes the subsystem's response function is\ndeveloped and thus converges faster. The distributed G-MSS method is then\ndemonstrated to successfully solve a series of central functions, e.g. power\nflow, contingency analysis, voltage stability assessment, economic dispatch and\noptimal power flow, of the TDCEM. The severe issues of over-voltage and\nerroneous assessment of the system security that are caused by DERs are thus\nresolved by the G-MSS method with modest computation cost.\n",

Generally, distribution networks can operate in a more resilient and\neconomic fashion through proper coordination of DER. However, due to the\npartially uncontrollable and stochastic nature of some DER, the variance of net\nload of distribution systems increases, which raises the operational cost and\ncomplicates operation for transmission companies. This motivates peak shaving\nand valley filling using energy storage units deployed in distribution systems.\nThis paper aims at theoretical formulation of optimal load variance\nminimization, where the infinity norm of net load is minimized. Then, the\nproblem is reformulated equivalently as a linear program. A case study is\nperformed with capacity-limited battery energy storage model and the simplified\npower flow model of a radial distribution network. The influence of capacity\nlimit and deployment location are studied.\n",

Furthermore, by the structure property of the\ntime-varying nonsingular transformation matrix and the Lipschitz condition, the\nimpacts of the nonlinear term on the disagreement dynamics are linearized and\nthe gain matrix of the consensus protocol is determined on the basis of the\nRiccati equation. Moreover, an approach to minimize the guaranteed cost is\ngiven in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the numerical simulation\nis shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.\n",

A multi-stage stochastic programming is proposed\nfrom the demand side in order to understand the rational decisions. The\nconsumer preferences are modeled as a risk-averse function under additive\nuncertainty. The user chooses the optimal consumption profile to maximize his\neconomic benefits for each period. The stochastic optimization problem is\nsolved backward in time. A particular situation is developed when the System\nOperator (SO) uses consumption of the previous interval as the\nhousehold-specific baseline for the DR program. It is found that a rational\nconsumer alters the baseline in order to increase the well-being when there is\nan economic incentive. As results, whether the incentive is lower than the\nretail price, the user shifts his load requirement to the baseline setting\nperiod. On the other hand, if the incentive is greater than the regular energy\nprice, the optimal decision is that the user spends the maximum possible energy\nin the baseline setting period and reduces the consumption at the PTR time.\nThis consumer behavior produces more energy consumption in total considering\nall periods. In addition, the user with high uncertainty level in his energy\npattern should spend less energy than a predictable consumer when the incentive\nis lower than the retail price.\n",

The primary contribution\nof this project is the optimization of an aggregated load schedule for\nparticipation in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) real time\n(15-minute) electricity market. The goal of the aggregator is to optimally\nmanage its pool of resources, particularly the flexible resources, in order to\nminimize its cost in the real time market. We achieves this through the use of\na model predictive control scheme. A critical difference between the prior work\nin \\cite{Travacca} is that the structure of the optimization problem is\ndrastically different.

The planning based strategy aims to\nfind the global optimal passing order, but it is time-consuming when the number\nof considered vehicles is large. In contrast, the ad hoc negotiation based\nstrategy runs fast, but it always finds a local optimal solution. In this\npaper, we propose a grouping based cooperative driving strategy to make a good\ntradeoff between time consumption and coordination performance. The key idea is\nto fix the passing orders for some vehicles whose inter-vehicle headways are\nsmall enough (e.g., smaller than the pre-selected grouping threshold). From the\nviewpoint of optimization, this method reduces the size of the solution space.\nA brief analysis shows that the sub-optimal passing order found by the grouping\nbased strategy has a high probability to be close to the global optimal passing\norder, if the grouping threshold is appropriately chosen. A series of\nsimulation experiments are carried out to validate that the proposed strategy\ncan yield a satisfied coordination performance with less time consumption and\nis promising to be used in practice.\n",

This problem has its\norigins in electric circuit theory, and is directly applicable to the\ncost-effective design of mechanical systems containing the inerter. Despite a\nrich history, the problem can only be considered solved for networks that\ncontain at most two energy storage elements, and in a small number of other\nspecial cases. In this paper, we solve the minimal network realization problem\nfor the class of impedances realized by series-parallel networks containing at\nmost three energy storage elements. To accomplish this, we develop a novel\ncontinuity-based approach to eliminate redundant elements from a network.\n",

        "summary": "  The design of robots that are light, soft, powerful is a grand challenge.\nSince they can easily adapt to dynamic environments, soft robotic systems have\nthe potential of changing the status-quo of bulky robotics. A crucial component\nof soft robotics is a soft actuator that is activated by external stimuli to\ngenerate desired motions. Unfortunately, there is a lack of powerful soft\nactuators that operate through lightweight power sources. To that end, we\nrecently designed a highly scalable, flexible, biocompatible Electromagnetic\nSoft Actuator (ESA). With ESAs, artificial muscles can be designed by\nintegrating a network of ESAs. The main research gap addressed in this work is\nin the absence of system-theoretic understanding of the impact of the realtime\ncontrol and actuator selection algorithms on the performance of networked\nsoft-body actuators and ESAs. The objective of this paper is to establish a\nframework that guides the analysis and robust control of networked ESAs. A\nnovel ESA is described, and a configuration of soft actuator matrix to resemble\nartificial muscle fiber is presented. A mathematical model which depicts the\nphysical network is derived, considering the disturbances due to external\nforces and linearization errors as an integral part of this model. Then, a\nrobust control and minimal actuator selection problem with logistic constraints\nand control input bounds is formulated, and tractable computational routines\nare proposed with numerical case studies.\n",

Since real ocean waves are non-stationary by\nnature and not defined by a single frequency component, the PTO can be either\ntuned at a constant frequency characterized by the local spectrum, or\ncontinuously tuned to a representative wave frequency. In either case, a\ntime-frequency representation of the waves is expected since the wave profile\nchanges over time. This paper discusses about the PTO tuning problem for\npassive and reactive controllers, in real waves, by comparing different methods\nfor time-varying frequency estimation: the extended Kalman filter (EKF),\nfrequency-locked loop (FLL), and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). The aim is to\nverify the impact of such methods on the absorbed and reactive powers, and the\nPTO rating. It is shown that the mean estimated frequency of the EKF, and FLL,\nconverges respectively to the mean centroid frequency, and energy frequency, of\nthe excitation force spectrum. Moreover, the HHT mean frequency has no\ncorrelation with the spectral statistical properties. A comparison of the\nenergy absorbed shows that up to 37% more energy is obtained with the HHT over\nthe other estimation methods.

In the proposed method, the innovation term\nis constructed by passing the gradient of an invariant cost function, resolved\nin a basis of the tangent space, through a linear time-invariant system. The\nintroduction of the linear system completes the extension of linear\ncomplementary filters to nonlinear Lie group observers by allowing higher-order\nfiltering.

A\nnecessary and sufficient graphical condition for infinitesimal weak rigidity of\nplanar frameworks is derived. As an application of the proposed weak rigidity\ntheory, a gradient based control law and a non-gradient based control law are\ndesigned for a group of single-integrator modeled agents to stabilize a desired\nformation shape, respectively. Using the gradient control law, we prove that an\ninfinitesimally weakly rigid formation is locally exponentially stable.

In the literature of rigid formation, the sensing graph\nis always required to be rigid. Using the non-gradient control law based on\nweak rigidity theory, the sensing graph is unnecessary to be rigid for local\nexponential stability of the formation.

        "summary": "  In this paper, we study the global stability properties of a multi-agent\nmodel of natural resource consumption that balances ecological and social\nnetwork components in determining the consumption behavior of a group of\nagents. The social network is assumed to be leaderless, a condition that\nensures that no single node has a greater influence than any other node on the\ndynamics of the resource consumption. It is shown that any network structure\ncan be made leaderless by the social preferences of the agents. The ecological\nnetwork component includes a quantification of each agent's environmental\nconcern, which captures each individual agent's threshold for when a resource\nbecomes scarce. We show that leaderlessness and a mild bound on agents'\nenvironmental concern are jointly sufficient for global asymptotic stability of\nthe consumption network to a positive consumption value, indicating that\nappropriately configured networks can continuously consume a resource without\ndriving its value to zero. The behavior of these leaderless resource\nconsumption networks is verified in simulation.\n",

On\nthe one hand, most distributed energy resources (DER) are converter-interfaced\nand do not inherently respond to frequency variations. On the other hand,\ncurrent inertia emulation approach cannot provide guaranteed response. In this\npaper, a model reference control based inertia emulation strategy is proposed\nfor diesel-wind systems. Desired inertia can be precisely emulated through the\nproposed strategy. A typical frequency response model with parametric inertia\nis set to be the reference model. A measurement at a specific location delivers\nthe information about the disturbance acting on the diesel-wind system to the\nreference model. The objective is for the speed of the diesel generator to\ntrack the reference so that the desired inertial response is realized. In\naddition, polytopic parameter uncertainty will be considered. The control\nstrategy is configured in different ways according to different operating\npoints. The parameters of the reference model are scheduled to ensure adequate\nfrequency response under a pre-defined worst case. The controller is\nimplemented in a nonlinear three-phase diesel-wind system fed microgrid using\nthe Simulink software platform. The results show that exact synthetic inertia\ncan be emulated and adequate frequency response is achieved.\n",

Particularly, fast controllable loads are utilized to restore system\nfrequency under changing power imbalance in an optimal manner. The imbalanced\npower causing frequency deviation is decomposed into three parts: a known\nconstant part, an unknown low-frequency variation and a high-frequency\nresidual. The known steady part is usually the prediction of power imbalance.\nThe variation may result from the fluctuation of renewable resources, electric\nvehicle charging, etc., which is usually unknown to operators. The\nhigh-frequency residual is usually unknown and treated as an external\ndisturbance. Correspondingly, in this paper, we resolve the following three\nproblems in different timescales: 1) allocate the steady part of power\nimbalance economically; 2) mitigate the effect of unknown low-frequency power\nvariation locally; 3) attenuate unknown high-frequency disturbances. To this\nend, a distributed controller combining consensus method with adaptive internal\nmodel control is proposed. We first prove that the closed-loop system is\nasymptotically stable and converges to the optimal solution of an optimization\nproblem if the external disturbance is not included. We then prove that the\npower variation can be mitigated accurately. Furthermore, we show that the\nclosed-loop system is robust against both parameter uncertainty and external\ndisturbances. The New England system is used to verify the efficacy of our\ndesign.\n",

Each microgrid is\nconsidered to be interfaced to the distribution feeder though a solid-state\ntransformer (SST). The internal duty cycle based controllers of each SST\nensures stable regulation of power commands during normal operation. But\nproblem arises when a sudden change in load or generation occurs in any\nmicrogrid in a completely unpredicted way in between the time instants at which\nthe SSTs receive their power setpoints.

We design\nan input-output linearization based controller, and show that it guarantees\nclosed-loop stability via a cascade connection with the SST model. The design\nis also extended to the case when multiple SSTs must coordinate their\nindividual storage controllers to assist a given SST whose storage capacity is\ninsufficient to serve the unpredicted load.

In this context, a key challenging requirement for both\nconnected and autonomous vehicles is that they will need to become cognitive\nbodies, able to parse information and use only the pieces of information that\nare relevant to the vehicle in the context of a given journey. In order to\naddress this fundamental requirement, a decision engine is presented in this\npaper. The engine makes it possible for the vehicle to understand which pieces\nof information are really relevant, and subsequently to process only those\npieces of information. In order to illustrate the key features of our system,\nwe show that it is possible to build upon the engine to develop a distributed\ntraffic management system, and then we validate such a system via both\nconventional (numerical and SUMO-based) simulations and a Hardware-in-the-Loop\n(HIL) platform. Both the conventional simulations and the HIL validation showed\nthat the engine can be effectively used to design a distributed traffic\nmanagement system.\n",

Traditionally, numerical integration methods are adopted by simulation\nsoftware to solve nonlinear power system differential-algebraic equations about\nany given contingency under a specific operating condition.

This paper proposes a general\nsemi-analytical approach that derives and evaluates an SAS in the form of power\nseries in time to approximate the solutions of power system differential\nequations. An error-rate upper bound of the SAS is also proposed to guarantee\nthe reliable use of adaptive time windows for evaluation of the SAS.

A\nmechanism based on the steady state distribution of the underlying Markov chain\nis developed for planning beyond a finite horizon in the HHV energy management\nproblem. Road elevation information is forecasted along the horizon and then\nmerged with the statistical model of driver behavior to increase accuracy of\nthe horizon optimization. The characteristics of each strategy are compared and\nthe benefit of learning driver behavior is analyzed through simulation on three\ndrive cycles, including one real world drive cycle. A simulation is designed to\nexplicitly demonstrate the benefit of adapting the Markov chain to real time\ndriver behavior. Experimental results demonstrate the real time potential of\nthe primary algorithm when implemented on a processor with limited\ncomputational resources.\n",

In contrast, during grid faults without any equilibrium\npoints, the critical clearing angle (CCA) for the PSC-VSC is identified, which\nis found equal to the power angle at the unstable equilibrium point of the\npost-fault operation. This fixed CCA facilitates the design of power system\nprotection.

Within this general class of systems, we consider time-triggered\nstochastic hybrid systems (TTSHS), where the state evolves continuously\naccording to a linear time-varying dynamical system. Discrete events occur\nbased on an underlying renewal process (timer), and the intervals between\nsuccessive events follow an arbitrary continuous probability density function.\nMoreover, whenever the event occurs, the state is reset based on a linear\naffine transformation that allows for the inclusion of state-dependent and\nindependent noise terms. Our key contribution is derivation of necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the stability of statistical moments, along with\nexact analytical expressions for the steady-state moments. These results are\nillustrated on an example from cell biology, where deterministic synthesis and\ndecay of a gene product (RNA or protein) is coupled to random timing of\ncell-division events. As experimentally observed, cell-division events occur\nbased on an internal timer that measures the time elapsed since the start of\ncell cycle (i.e., last event). Upon division, the gene product level is halved,\ntogether with a state-dependent noise term that arises due to randomness in the\npartitioning of molecules between two daughter cells. We show that the TTSHS\nframework is conveniently suited to capture the time evolution of gene product\nlevels, and derive unique formulas connecting its mean and variance to\nunderlying model parameters and noise mechanisms. Systematic analysis of the\nformulas reveal counterintuitive insights, such as, if the partitioning noise\nis large then making the timing of cell division more random reduces noise in\ngene product levels.\n",

We analyse which\npredictor input signals are relevant and contribute to variance reduction,\nwhile still guaranteeing the consistency of the estimate. For a targeted local\nmodule, a comparison of its estimate variance is made between a full-MISO\napproach and an immersed network setting, where a reduced number of inputs is\nused, while still guaranteeing consistency. A case study of a four-node network\nis considered and it is shown that a smaller set of predictor inputs can, under\nsome conditions, result in a smaller variance compared to the full-MISO\napproach.\n",

Dual to the ensemble control problem, ensemble estimation\ndeals with the problem of using a finite number of measurement outputs to\nestimate the initial condition of every individual system in the ensemble. We\nintroduce in the paper an innovative class of ensemble systems, termed\ndistinguished ensemble systems, and establish sufficient conditions for\ncontrollability and observability of such systems. Every distinguished ensemble\nsystem has two key components, namely distinguished control vector fields and\ncodistinguished observation functions. Roughly speaking, a set of vector fields\nis distinguished if it is closed (up to scaling) under Lie bracket, and\nmoreover, every vector field in the set can be obtained by a Lie bracket of two\nvector fields in the same set. Similarly, a set of functions is codistinguished\nto a set of vector fields if the Lie derivatives of the functions along the\ngiven vector fields yield (up to scaling) the same set of functions. We\ndemonstrate in the paper that the structure of a distinguished ensemble system\ncan significantly simplify the analysis of ensemble controllability and\nobservability, and can be used as a principle for ensemble system design. We\nfurther address in the paper the existence of a distinguished ensemble system\nfor a given manifold. Specifically, we show that every connected, semi-simple\nLie group admits a set of distinguished vector fields, together with a set of\ncodistinguished functions. The proof is constructive, leveraging structure\ntheory of semi-simple real Lie algebras and representation theory.

Safety specification requires\nthe execution traces to stay in a safe region. Finally, for reach-while-stay\nspecification, safety is needed until a target set is reached.\n  The design task consists of two phases. In the first phase, the control\ndesign problem is reduced to the question of finding a control certificate.\nMore precisely, the goal of the first phase is to define a class of control\ncertificates with a specific structure. This definition should guarantee the\nfollowing: \"Having a control certificate, one can systematically design a\ncontroller and prove its correctness at the same time.\" The goal in the second\nphase is to find such a control certificate. We define a potential control\ncertificate space (hypothesis space) using parameterized functions. Next, we\nprovide an inductive search framework to find proper parameters, which yield a\ncontrol certificate.\n  Finally, we evaluate our framework. We show that discovering control\ncertificates is practically feasible and demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nautomatically designed controllers through simulations and real physical\nsystems experiments.\n",

For the part of trajectory tracking,\nfunctional redundancies among all available actuators provide an opportunity to\nreduce safety requirements for single actuators. Yet, the exploitation of\nfunctional redundancies must be well argued if employed in a safety concept as\nphysical limits can be reached. In this paper, we want to examine from a\ntrajectory tracking perspective whether such a concept can be used. For this,\nwe present a model predictive fault-tolerant trajectory tracking approach for\nover-actuated vehicles featuring wheel individual all-wheel drive, brakes, and\nsteering. Applying this approach exemplarily demonstrates for a selected\nreference trajectory that degradations such as missing or undesired wheel\ntorques as well as reduced steering dynamics can be compensated. Degradations\nat the physical actuator limits lead to significant deviations from the\nreference trajectory while small constant steering angles are partially\ncritical.\n",

An active distribution power\nsystem (DPS) having DERs reportedly can work as a reactive power prosumer to\nhelp balance the reactive power in the TPS. The reactive power potential (RPP)\nof a DPS, which is the range between the maximal inductive and capacitive\nreactive power the DPS can reliably provide, should be accurately estimated.\nHowever, an accurate estimation is difficult because of the network\nconstraints, mixed discrete and continuous variables, and the nonnegligible\nuncertainty in the DPS. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a robust RPP\nestimation method based on two-stage robust optimization, where the uncertainty\nin DERs and the boundary-bus voltage is considered. In this two-stage robust\nmodel, the RPP is pre-estimated in the first stage and its robust feasibility\nfor any possible instance of the uncertainty is checked via a tractable problem\nin the second stage. The column-and-constraint generation algorithm is adopted,\nwhich solves this model in finite iterations. Case studies show that this\nrobust method excels in yielding a completely reliable RPP, and also that a\nDPS, even under the uncertainty, is still an effective reactive power prosumer\nfor the TPS.\n",

The compositional scheme is based on small-gain type\nreasoning. In particular, we use a notion of so-called alternating simulation\nfunctions as a relation between each subsystem and its symbolic model. Assuming\nsome small-gain type conditions, we construct compositionally an overall\nalternating simulation function as a relation between an interconnection of\nsymbolic models and that of original control subsystems. In such\ncompositionality reasoning, the gains associated with the alternating\nsimulation functions of the subsystems satisfy a certain \"small-gain\"\ncondition. In addition, we introduce a technique to construct symbolic models\ntogether with their corresponding alternating simulation functions for\ndiscrete-time control subsystems under some stability property. Finally, we\napply our results to the temperature regulation in a circular building by\nconstructing compositionally a finite abstraction of a network containing $N$\nrooms for any $N\\geq3$. We use the constructed symbolic models as substitutes\nto synthesize controllers compositionally maintaining room temperatures in a\ncomfort zone. We choose $N=1000$ for the sake of illustrating the results. We\nalso apply our proposed techniques to a nonlinear example of fully connected\nnetwork in which the compositionality condition still holds for any number of\ncomponents. In these case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed\nresults in comparison with the existing compositionality technique in the\nliterature using a dissipativity-type reasoning.\n",

The proposed method tunes the two gains of STA on line\nsimultaneously such that a second order sliding mode can take place with small\nrectifying gains. The perturbation magnitude is obtained exactly by employing a\nthird-order sliding mode observer in opposition to the conventional\napproximations by using a first order low pass filter. While driving the\nsliding variable to the sliding mode surface, one gain of the STA automatically\nconverges to an adjacent area of the perturbation magnitude in finite time. The\nother gain is adjusted by the above gain to guarantee the robustness of the\nSTA. This method requires only one parameter to be adjusted. The adjustment is\nstraightforward because it just keeps increasing until it fulfills the\nconvergence constraints. For large values of the parameter, chattering in the\nupdate law of the two gains is avoided by employing a geometry based backward\nEuler integration method. The usefulness is illustrated by an example of\ndesigning an equivalent control based sliding mode control (ECBC-SMC) with the\nproposed adaptive STA for a perturbed LTI system.\n",

We begin by deriving the Classical Car-Following Model with\nDelayed Acceleration Feedback (CCFM-DAF). We then derive the necessary and\nsufficient condition for local stability of the CCFM-DAF. Next, we show that\nthe CCFM-DAF transits from the locally stable to the unstable regime via a Hopf\nbifurcation; thus leading to the emergence of limit cycles in system dynamics.\nWe then propose a suitable linear transformation that enables us to analyze the\nlocal bifurcation properties of the CCFM-DAF by studying the analogous\nproperties of the CCFM. We also study the impact of DAF on three important\ndynamical properties of the CCFM; namely, non-oscillatory convergence, string\nstability and robust stability. Our analyses are complemented with a stability\nchart and a bifurcation diagram. Our work reveals the following detrimental\neffects of DAF on the CCFM: (i) reduction in the locally stable region, (ii)\nincrease in the frequency of the emergent limit cycles, (iii) decrease in the\namplitude of the emergent limit cycles, (iv) destruction of the non-oscillatory\nproperty, (vi) increased risk of string instability, and (vii) reduced\nresilience towards parametric uncertainty.

Combining the over-approximation for the output set of\nan MLP based controller and reachable set computation routines for ordinary\ndifference/differential equation (ODE) models, an algorithm is developed to\nestimate the reachable set of the closed-loop system. Finally, safety\nverification for neural network control systems can be performed by checking\nthe existence of intersections between the estimated reachable set and unsafe\nregions. The approach is implemented in a computational software prototype and\nevaluated on numerical examples.\n",

In CRONE control, robustness is achieved\nby creation of constant phase behaviour around bandwidth with the use of\nfractional operators, also allowing more freedom in shaping the open-loop\nfrequency response. However, being a linear controller it suffers from the\ninevitable trade-off between robustness and performance as a result of the\nwaterbed effect. Here reset control is introduced in the CRONE design to\novercome the fundamental limitations. In the new controller design, reset phase\nadvantage is approximated using describing function analysis and used to\nachieve better open-loop shape. Sufficient quadratic stability conditions are\nshown for the designed CRONE reset controllers and the control design is\nvalidated on a Lorentz-actuated nanometre precision stage. It is shown that for\nsimilar phase margin, better performance in terms of reference-tracking and\nnoise attenuation can be achieved.\n",

Computationally efficient solutions are also\nobtained via the MPC version of the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator\n(ILQR), a variant of Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). Information\ndivergence is used to define the distance between the swarm RFS and the desired\nswarm configuration through the use of the modified $L_2^2$ distance.\nSimulation results using MPC and ILQR show that the swarm intensity converges\nto the desired intensity. Additionally, the RFS control formulation is shown to\nbe very flexible in terms of the number of agents in the swarm and\nconfiguration of the desired Gaussian mixtures. Lastly, the ILQR and the\nGaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density filter are used in conjunction\nto solve a spacecraft relative motion problem with imperfect information to\nshow the viability of centralized RFS control for this real-world scenario.\n",

Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel randomized\ngossip-based distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. Information exchange and\ncomputation in the proposed algorithm can be carried out in an arbitrarily\nconnected network of nodes. In addition, the computational burden can be\ndistributed for a sensor which communicates with a stochastically selected\nneighbor at each clock step under schemes of gossip algorithm. In this case,\nthe error covariance matrix changes stochastically at every clock step, thus\nthe convergence is considered in a probabilistic sense. We provide the mean\nsquare convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. Under a sufficient\ncondition, we show that the proposed algorithm is quite appealing as it\nachieves better mean square error performance theoretically than the\nnoncooperative decentralized Kalman filtering algorithm. Besides, considering\nthe limited computation, communication, and energy resources in the wireless\nsensor networks, we propose an optimization problem which minimizes the average\nexpected state estimation error based on the proposed algorithm. To solve the\nproposed problem efficiently, we transform it into a convex optimization\nproblem. And a sub-optimal solution is attained.

To degrade the estimation\nquality with power constraint, the attacker aims to solve how much power to\nobstruct the channel each time, which is the recently proposed optimal attack\nenergy management problem. The existing works are built on an ideal link model\nin which the packet dropout never occurs without attack. To encompass wireless\ntransmission losses, we introduce the SINR-based link. First, we focus on the\ncase when the attacker employs the constant power level. To maximize the\nterminal error at the remote estimator, we provide some sufficient conditions\nfor the existence of an explicit solution to the optimal static attack energy\nmanagement problem and the solution is constructed. Compared with the existing\nresult in which corresponding sufficient conditions work only when the system\nmatrix is normal, the obtained conditions in this paper are viable for a\ngeneral system and shown to be more relaxed. For the other system index, the\naverage error, the associated sufficient conditions are also derived based on\ndifferent analysis with the existing work. And a feasible method is presented\nfor both indexes when the system cannot meet the sufficient conditions. Then\nwhen the real-time ACK information can be acquired, an MDP based algorithm is\ndesigned to solve the optimal dynamic attack energy management problem. We\nfurther study the optimal tradeoff between attack power and system degradation.\nBy moving power constraint into the objective function to maximize system index\nand minimize energy consumption, the other MDP based algorithm is proposed to\nfind the optimal attack policy which is further shown to have a monotone\nstructure.

We first study the local stability of these models, and derive\nbounds on various model parameters and the feedback delay for the concentration\nto equilibrate. We then deduce conditions for non-oscillatory convergence of\nthe solutions, which could ensure that the blood cell concentration does not\noscillate.

Owing to the possibility that physiological parameters can seldom be\nestimated precisely, we also derive bounds for robust stability\\textemdash\nwhich enable one to ensure that the blood cell concentration equilibrates\ndespite parametric uncertainty.

The resulting\nreduction of total inertia raises important issues of power grid stability,\nespecially over short-time scales. We have constructed a model of the\nsynchronous grid of continental Europe with which we numerically investigate\nfrequency deviations as well as rates of change of frequency (RoCoF) following\nabrupt power losses. The magnitude of RoCoF's and frequency deviations strongly\ndepend on the fault location, and we find the largest effects for faults\nlocated on the slowest mode - the Fiedler mode - of the network Laplacian\nmatrix. This mode essentially vanishes over Belgium, Eastern France, Western\nGermany, northern Italy and Switzerland. Buses inside these regions are only\nweakly affected by faults occuring outside. Conversely, faults inside these\nregions have only a local effect and disturb only weakly outside buses.\nFollowing this observation, we reduce rotational inertia through three\ndifferent procedures by either (i) reducing inertia on the Fiedler mode, (ii)\nreducing inertia homogeneously and (iii) reducing inertia outside the Fiedler\nmode. We find that procedure (iii) has little effect on disturbance\npropagation, while procedure (i) leads to the strongest increase of RoCoF and\nfrequency deviations.

In this paper, we\nmodel various cyber threats to air traffic control systems, and analyze how\nthese attacks could impact the flow of aircraft through the airspace. To\nperform this analysis, we consider a model for wide-area air traffic based on a\ndynamic queuing network model. Then we introduce three different attacks (Route\nDenial of Service, Route Selection Tampering, and Sector Denial of Service) to\nthe air traffic control system, and explore how these attacks manipulate the\nsector flows by evaluating the queue backlogs for each sector's outflows.\nFurthermore, we then explore graph-level vulnerability metrics to identify the\nsectors that are most vulnerable to various flow manipulations, and compare\nthem to case-study simulations of the various attacks. The results suggest that\nRoute Denial of Service attacks have a significant impact on the target sector\nand lead to the largest degradation to the overall air traffic flows.\nFurthermore, the impact of Sector Denial of Service attack impacts are\nprimarily confined to the target sector, while the Route Selection Tampering\nimpacts are mostly confined to certain aircraft.\n",

First,\nsystem operators have to deal with higher degrees of uncertainty due to\nforecast errors and variability in renewable energy production. Second, with\nabundant potential of renewable generation in remote locations, there is an\nincreasing interest in the use of High Voltage Direct Current lines (HVDC) to\nincrease transmission capacity. These HVDC transmission lines and the\nflexibility and controllability they offer must be incorporated effectively and\nsafely into the system. In this work, we introduce an optimization tool that\naddresses both challenges by incorporating the full AC power flow equations,\nchance constraints to address the uncertainty of renewable infeed, modelling of\npoint-to-point HVDC lines, and optimized corrective control policies to model\nthe generator and HVDC response to uncertainty. The main contributions are\ntwofold. First, we introduce a HVDC line model and the corresponding HVDC\nparticipation factors in a chance-constrained AC-OPF framework. Second, we\nmodify an existing algorithm for solving the chance-constrained AC-OPF to allow\nfor optimization of the generation and HVDC participation factors. Using\nrealistic wind forecast data, for 10 and IEEE 39 bus systems with HVDC lines\nand wind farms, we show that our proposed OPF formulation achieves good in- and\nout-of-sample performance whereas not considering uncertainty leads to high\nconstraint violation probabilities.

Following each software refresh a\nsafety controller assures the CPS is driven to a safe state before returning to\nthe mission control mode when the CPS is again vulnerable attacks.

        "summary": "  Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) consumes a significant\nfraction of energy in commercial buildings. Hence, the use of optimization\ntechniques to reduce HVAC energy consumption has been widely studied. Model\npredictive control (MPC) is one state of the art optimization technique for\nHVAC control which converts the control problem to a sequence of optimization\nproblems, each over a finite time horizon. In a typical MPC, future system\nstate is estimated from a model using predictions of model inputs, such as\nbuilding occupancy and outside air temperature. Consequently, as prediction\naccuracy deteriorates, MPC performance--in terms of occupant comfort and\nbuilding energy use--degrades. In this work, we use a custom-built building\nthermal simulator to systematically investigate the impact of occupancy\nprediction errors on occupant comfort and energy consumption. Our analysis\nshows that in our test building, as occupancy prediction error increases from\n5\\% to 20\\% the performance of an MPC-based HVAC controller becomes worse than\nthat of even a simple static schedule. However, when combined with a personal\nenvironmental control (PEC) system, HVAC controllers are considerably more\nrobust to prediction errors. Thus, we quantify the effectiveness of PECs in\nmitigating the impact of forecast errors on MPC control for HVAC systems.\n",

The first\ncontribution of this work is to generalize the classical notion of signed\nnetworks for graphs with scalar weights to graphs with nonlinear edge functions\nusing notions from passivity theory. We show that the output of the network can\nfinally form one or several steady-state clusters if all edges are positive,\nand in particular, all nodes can reach an output agreement if there is a\nconnected subnetwork spanning all nodes and strictly positive edges. When there\nare non-positive edges added to the network, we show that the tension of the\nnetwork still converges to the equilibria of the edge functions if the relative\noutputs of the nodes connected by non-positive edges converge to their\nequilibria. Furthermore, we establish the equivalent circuit models for signed\nnonlinear networks, and define the concept of equivalent edge functions which\nis a generalization of the notion of effective resistance. We finally\ncharacterize the relationship between the convergence property and the\nequivalent edge function, when a non-positive edge is added to a strictly\npositive network comprised of nonlinear integrators.

Chief among these techniques are backpressure (BP) control algorithms,\nwhich were originally developed of for large wireless networks. In addition to\nbeing light-weight computationally, they come with guarantees of performance at\nthe network level, specifically network-wide stability. The dynamics in\nbackpressure control are represented using networks of point queues and this\nalso applies to all of the applications to traffic control. As such, BP in\ntraffic fail to capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along the\nintersection links and, consequently, spill-back dynamics. This paper derives a\nposition weighted backpressure (PWBP) control policy for network traffic\napplying continuum modeling principles of traffic dynamics and thus capture the\nspatial distribution of vehicles along network roads and spill-back dynamics.\nPWBP inherits the computational advantages of traditional BP. To prove\nstability of PWBP, (i) a Lyapunov functional that captures the spatial\ndistribution of vehicles is developed; (ii) the capacity region of the network\nis formally defined in the context of macroscopic network traffic; and (iii) it\nis proved, when exogenous arrival rates are within the capacity region, that\nPWBP control is network stabilizing. We conduct comparisons against a\nreal-world adaptive control implementation for an isolated intersection.\nComparisons are also performed against other BP approaches in addition to\noptimized fixed timing control at the network level. These experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of PWBP over the other control policies in terms of\ncapacity region, network-wide delay, congestion propagation speed,\nrecoverability from heavy congestion (outside of the capacity region), and\nresponse to incidents.\n",

Then, we analyze the impact of asynchrony on optimal\npower control and propose an asynchronous iteration algorithm based on the\nsynchronous version. By introducing a random clock at each iteration, different\ntypes of asynchrony are fitted into a unified framework, where the asynchronous\nalgorithm is converted into a fixed-point problem based on the operator\nsplitting method, leading to a convergence proof. We further provide an upper\nbound estimation of the time delay in the communication. Moreover, the\nreal-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in both AC and DC MGs is\nintroduced. By taking the power system as a solver, the controller is\nsimplified by reducing one order and the power loss can be considered.

A special case of this result leads to the\nsolution of a leader-following consensus problem of multiple discrete-time\ndouble-integrator systems over jointly connected switching networks. Then, we\nfurther develop the adaptive distributed observer for the discrete-time leader\nsystem over jointly connected switching networks, which has the advantage over\nthe distributed observer in that it does not require that every follower know\nthe system matrix of the leader system. As an application of the discrete-time\ndistributed observer, we will solve the cooperative output regulation problem\nof a discrete-time linear multi-agent system over jointly connected switching\nnetworks. A leader-following formation problem of mobile robots will be used to\nillustrate our design. This problem cannot be handled by any existing approach.\n",

In contrast with\nexisting control schemes for propofol delivery, the proposed scheme guarantees\noverdosing prevention while ensuring good performance. The core idea is to\nreformulate overdosing prevention as a constraint, and then use the recently\nintroduced Explicit Reference Governor to enforce the constraint satisfaction\nat all times. The proposed scheme is evaluated in comparison with a robust PID\ncontroller on a simulated surgical procedure for 44 patients whose\nPharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic models have been identified using clinical\ndata. The results demonstrate that the proposed constrained control scheme can\ndeliver propofol to yield good induction phase response while preventing\noverdosing in patients; whereas other existing schemes might cause overdosing\nin some patients. Simulations show that mean rise time, mean settling time, and\nmean overshoot of less than 5 [min], 8 [min], and 10%, respectively, are\nachieved, which meet typical anesthesiologists' response specifications.\n",

While this has allowed the construction of advanced\nopen-loop circuitry based on cascaded DNA strand displacement (DSD) reactions,\nlittle progress has so far been made in developing the requisite theoretical\nmachinery to inform the systematic design of feedback controllers in this\ncontext. Here, we develop a number of foundational theoretical results on the\nequilibria, stability, and dynamics of nucleic acid controllers. In particular,\nwe show that the implementation of feedback controllers using DSD reactions\nintroduces additional nonlinear dynamics, even in the case of purely linear\ndesigns, e.g. PI controllers. By decomposing the effects of these\nnon-observable nonlinear dynamics, we show that, in general, the stability of\nthe linear system design does not necessarily imply the stability of the\nunderlying chemical network, which can be lost under experimental variability\nwhen feedback interconnections are introduced. We provide an in-depth\ntheoretical analysis of an example illustrating this phenomenon, whereby the\nlinear design does not capture the instability of the full nonlinear system\nimplemented as a DSD reaction network, and we further confirm these results\nusing VisualDSD, a bespoke software tool for simulating nucleic acid-based\ncircuits.

The\nrepresentation of nuclear, coal and oil generation facilities is set to\ndramatically fall, and natural gas, wind and solar facilities will come to fill\ntheir place. The introduction of variable energy resources (VERs) like solar\nand wind, however, necessitates fundamental changes in the power grid's dynamic\noperation. VER forecasts are uncertain and their profiles are intermittent thus\nrequiring greater quantities of operating reserves. This paper describes the\nmethodology and the key findings of the 2017 ISO New England System Operational\nAnalysis and Renewable Energy Integration Study (SOARES). This study was\ncommissioned by the ISO New England stakeholders to investigate the effect of\nseveral scenarios of varying generation mix on normal operating reserves. The\nproject was conducted using the holistic assessment approach called the\nElectric Power Enterprise Control System (EPECS) simulator.The EPECS\ncharacterizes a power system in terms of the physical power grid and its\nmultiple layers of control including commitment decisions, economic dispatch,\nand regulation services. This paper provides precise definitions of how\nvariable energy resources and operating reserves are modeled. It also includes\ndetailed models of the day-ahead resource scheduling, the same-day resource\nscheduling, the real-time balancing operations and the regulation service.\nAmong the key findings, the reports shows that scenarios with high penetrations\nof VERs exhaust their operating reserves for part of the year and all scenarios\ncurtail semi-dispatchable resources both to complement operating reserves and\nto mitigate some of the topological limitations of the system. Overall,\ncurtailment emerges as a key balancing performance control lever and there is a\nclear need for higher amounts of operating reserves.\n",

In this paper, a new form of the delayed feedback structure is\nintroduced. Based on the proposed delayed feedback method, a new robust\ntracking system is designed. This tracking system improves the features of the\nconventional state feedback with integral action and it is also able to reject\nhigher order disturbances compared to the conventional method. In addition, the\nproposed tracking system tracks the ramp-shape reference input signal as well,\nwhich this is not possible through the conventional state feedback. Due to easy\nimplementable feature of the proposed delayed feedback tracking system, it can\nbe used in practical applications effectively. Moreover, since the proposed\nmethod adds delays to the closed loop system dynamics, the ordinary\ndifferential equation of the system changes to a delay differential equation\nwith an infinite number of characteristic roots. Thus, conventional pole\nplacement procedures cannot be used to design the delayed feedback controller\nparameters and place the unstable roots in the left half plane. In this paper,\nthe simulated annealing algorithm is used to determine the proposed control\nsystem parameters and move the unstable roots of the delay differential\nequation to the left half plane.

The rate\nof convergence to consensus of multi-agent networks is critical to ensure\ncohesive, rapid response to external stimuli.

Note that current consensus-seeking control laws\ncan be considered as a gradient-based search over the graph's Laplacian\npotential. The main contribution of this article is to improve the convergence\nto consensus, by using an accelerated gradient-based search approach.\nAdditionally, this work shows that the accelerated-consensus approach can be\nimplemented in a distributed manner, where each agent applies a delayed self\nreinforcement, without the need for additional network information or changes\nto the network connectivity. Simulation results of an example networked system\nare presented in this work to show that the proposed accelerated-consensus\napproach with DSR can substantially improve synchronization during the\ntransition by about ten times, in addition to decreasing the transition time by\nabout half, when compared to the case without the DSR approach.

By bounding the system dynamics and neural network\noutputs, the set of reachable states can be over-approximated to provide a\nguarantee that the system will never reach states outside the set.

Our approach uses a ``counterexample-guided''\niterative loop that involves the interaction between a policy learner, a\ndemonstrator and a verifier. The learner is responsible for querying the\ndemonstrator in order to obtain the training data to guide the construction of\na policy candidate. This candidate is analyzed by the verifier and either\naccepted as correct, or rejected with a counterexample. In the latter case, the\ncounterexample is used to update the training data and further refine the\npolicy.\n  The approach is instantiated using receding horizon model-predictive\ncontrollers (MPCs) as demonstrators. Rather than using regression to fit a\npolicy to the demonstrator actions, we extend the MPC formulation with the\ngradient of the cost-to-go function evaluated at sample states in order to\nconstrain the set of policies compatible with the behavior of the demonstrator.\nWe demonstrate the successful application of the resulting policy learning\nschemes on two case studies and we show how simple, formally-verified policies\ncan be inferred starting from a complex and unverified nonlinear MPC\nimplementations. As a further benefit, the policies are many orders of\nmagnitude faster to implement when compared to the original MPCs.\n",

In this paper, we propose a novel mechanical system\ninspired microscopic traffic model using a mass-spring-damper-clutch system.\nThis model naturally captures the ego vehicle's resistance to large relative\nspeed and deviation from a (driver and speed dependent) desired relative\ndistance when following the lead vehicle. Comparing to existing car following\n(CF) models, this model offers physically interpretable insights on the\nunderlying CF dynamics, and is able to characterize the impact of the ego\nvehicle on the lead vehicle, which is neglected in existing CF models. Thanks\nto the nonlinear wave propagation analysis techniques for mechanical systems,\nthe proposed model therefore has great scalability so that multiple\nmass-spring-damper-clutch system can be chained to study the macroscopic\ntraffic flow. We investigate the stability of the proposed model on the system\nparameters and the time delay using spectral element method. We also develop a\nparallel recursive least square with inverse QR decomposition (PRLS-IQR)\nalgorithm to identify the model parameters online. These real-time estimated\nparameters can be used to predict the driving trajectory that can be\nincorporated in advanced vehicle longitudinal control systems for improved\nsafety and fuel efficiency. The PRLS-IQR is computationally efficient and\nnumerically stable so it is suitable for online implementation. The traffic\nmodel and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on both\nsimulations and naturalistic driving data from multiple drivers. Promising\nperformance is demonstrated.\n",

While providing guarantees on the\nclosed-loop system behavior is crucial in this application, off-the-shelf\nabstraction-based techniques cannot be directly employed to synthesize a\ncontroller in this setting because controller cannot always get instantaneous\naccess to the current state. As a result, the switching action has to be based\non slightly out-of-date measurements.

The properties\npreserved by this belief space abstraction are analyzed. Finally, an\nabstraction-based synthesis method is applied to this abstraction.

Motivated by this, we investigate how\nthe grid structure affects PLL-synchronization stability of multi-converter\nsystems. By using Kron reduction to eliminate the interior nodes, an equivalent\nreduced network is obtained which contains only the converter nodes. We\nexplicitly show how the Kron-reduced multi-converter system can be decoupled\ninto its modes. This modal representation allows us to demonstrate that the\nsmallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix of the Kron-reduced\nnetwork dominates the stability margin. We also carry out a sensitivity\nanalysis of this smallest eigenvalue to explore how a perturbation in the\noriginal network affects the stability margin. On this basis, we provide\nguidelines on how to improve the PLL-synchronization stability of\nmulti-converter systems by PLL-retuning, proper placement of converters or\nenhancing some weak connection in the network.

For this, we compute the minimum number of leaders, which are\nthe nodes directly receiving external control inputs, needed to make such\nnetworks controllable under all feasible coupling weights between agents. Then,\nfor any $N$ and $D$, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the minimum number of\nleaders needed to design strong structurally controllable networks with $N$\nnodes and diameter $D$. We also discuss that the bound is best possible for\narbitrary $N$ and $D$. Moreover, we construct a family of graphs for any $N$\nand $D$ such that the graphs have maximal edge sets (maximal robustness) while\nbeing strong structurally controllable with the number of leaders in the\nproposed sharp bound. We then analyze the robustness of this graph family. The\nresults suggest that optimizing robustness increases the number of leaders\nneeded for strong structural controllability.

A circular arc\nformation of defenders is formed around the attacker, and vector-field based\nguidance laws herd the attacker to a predefined safe area in the presence of\nrectangular obstacles. The defenders' formation is defined based on a novel\nvector field that imposes super-elliptic contours around the obstacles, to\nclosely resemble their rectangular shape. A novel finite-time stabilizing\ncontroller is proposed to guide the defenders to their desired formation while\navoiding obstacles and inter-agent collisions.

More specifically, we consider the problem of\ndeciding continuous-time control with temporal logic specifications. We prove\nthat sampled-data control of nonlinear systems with temporal logic\nspecifications is robustly decidable in the sense that, given a continuous-time\nnonlinear control system and a temporal logic formula, one can algorithmically\ndecide whether there exists a robust sampled-data control strategy to realize\nthis specification when the right-hand side of the system is slightly perturbed\nby a small disturbance. If the answer is positive, one can then construct a\n(potentially less) robust sampled-data control strategy that realizes the same\nspecification. The result is proved by constructing a robustly complete\nabstraction of the original continuous-time control system using sufficiently\nsmall discretization parameters. We illustrate the result with a nonlinear\ncontrol example.\n",

By studying the integrability conditions of\nthis associated system of partial differential equations we are able to\ncharacterize obstructions to our proposed method of constructing control\nLyapunov functions in terms of the structure of the original control system.\n",

We\naddress the problem by focussing on a prototype of such ensemble system,\nnamely, the ensemble of Bloch equations. The dynamics of the equations are\nstructurally identical, but show variations in Larmor dispersion and radio\nfrequency (rf) inhomogeneity. We assume that the initial state of every\nindividual system is unknown and, moreover, the population density of these\nindividual systems is also unknown. Furthermore, we assume that at any time,\nthere is only one scalar measurement output at our disposal. The measurement\noutput integrates a certain observation function, common to all individual\nsystems, over the continuum ensemble. The observability problem we pose in the\npaper is thus the following: Whether one is able to use the common control\ninput (i.e., the rf field) and the single measurement output to estimate the\ninitial states of the individual systems and, moreover, to identify the\npopulation density? Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient condition\nfor the ensemble system to be observable: We show that if the common\nobservation function is any harmonic homogeneous polynomial of positive degree,\nthen the ensemble system is observable. The main focus of the paper is to\ndemonstrate how to leverage tools from representation theory of Lie algebras to\naddress the observability problem. Although the results we establish in the\npaper are for the specific ensemble of Bloch equations, the approach we develop\nalong the analysis can be generalized to investigate observability of other\ngeneral ensembles of nonholonomic control systems with a single, integrated\nmeasurement output.\n",

The proposed method provides a\ndistribution estimation of load models coefficients and is robust to\nmeasurement errors.\n",

In this paper, we translate the result\nfrom the behavioral context to the classical state-space control framework and\nwe extend it to certain classes of nonlinear systems, which are linear in\nsuitable input-output coordinates. Moreover, we show how this extension can be\napplied to the data-driven simulation problem, where we introduce\nkernel-methods to obtain a rich set of basis functions.\n",

        "summary": "  Wind farms are an indispensable driver toward renewable and nonpolluting\nenergy resources. However, as ideal sites are limited, placement in remote and\nchallenging locations results in higher logistics costs and lower average wind\nspeeds. Therefore, it is critical to increase the reliability of the turbines\nto reduce maintenance costs. Robust implementation requires a thorough\nunderstanding of the loads subject to the turbine's control. Yet, such\ndynamically changing multidimensional loads are uncommon with other machinery,\nand generally underresearched. Therefore, a multitiered approach is proposed to\ninvestigate the load spectrum occurring in wind farms. Our approach relies on\nboth fundamental research using controllable test rigs, as well as analyses of\nreal-world loading conditions in high-frequency supervisory control and data\nacquisition data. A method is introduced to detect operational zones in wind\nfarm data and link them with load distributions. Additionally, while focused\nresearch further investigates the load spectrum, a method is proposed that\ncontinuously optimizes the farm's control protocols without the need to fully\nunderstand the loads that occur. A case of gearbox failure is investigated\nbased on a vast body of past experiments and suspect loads are identified.\nStarting from this evidence on the cause and effects of dynamic loads, the\npotential of our methods is shown by analyzing real-world farm loading\nconditions on a steady-state case of wake and developing a preventive row-based\ncontrol protocol for a case of cascading emergency brakes induced by a storm.\n",

To build the controller for the traffic network, a\nQ-learning-based strategy that controls the green light passing time at the\nnetwork intersections is applied. The controller includes two components: the\nregular Q-learning controller that controls the traffic light signal, and the\nadaptive controller that continuously optimizes the action space for the\nQ-learning algorithm in order to improve the efficiency of the Q-learning\nalgorithm. The regular Q-learning controller uses the control cost function as\na reward function to determine the action to choose. The adaptive controller\nexamines the control cost and updates the action space of the controller by\ndetermining the subset of actions that are most likely to obtain optimal\nresults and shrinking the action space to that subset. Uncertainties in traffic\ninflux and turning rate are introduced to test the robustness of the controller\nunder a stochastic environment. Compared with those with model predictive\ncontrol (MPC), the results show that the proposed Q-learning-based controller\noutperforms the MPC method by reaching a stable solution in a shorter period\nand achieves lower control costs. The proposed Q-learning-based controller is\nalso robust under 30% traffic demand uncertainty and 15% turning rate\nuncertainty.\n",

However, conventional algorithms to solve MDP are\ncomputationally infeasible in this scenario. Approximate dynamic programming\n(ADP) methods tackle this issue by computing approximate solutions. A widely\napplied ADP method is approximate linear program (ALP) which makes use of\nlinear function approximation and offers theoretical performance guarantees.\nNevertheless, the ALP is difficult to solve due to the presence of a large\nnumber of constraints and in practice, a reduced linear program (RLP) is solved\ninstead. The RLP has a tractable number of constraints sampled from the\noriginal constraints of the ALP. Though the RLP is known to perform well in\nexperiments the theoretical guarantees are available only for a specific RLP\nobtained under idealized assumptions.\n  In this paper, we generalize the RLP to define a generalized reduced linear\nprogram (GRLP) which has a tractable number of constraints that are obtained as\npositive linear combinations of the original constraints of the ALP. The main\ncontribution of this paper is the novel theoretical framework developed to\nobtain error bounds for any given GRLP. Central to our framework are two\n$\\max$-norm contraction operators. Our result solves theoretically justifies\nlinear approximation of constraints. We discuss the implication of our results\nin the contexts of ADP and reinforcement learning.

The major challenge for wind turbines is the electrical and\nthe mechanical failures which can occur at any time causing prospective\nbreakdowns and damages and therefore it leads to machine downtimes and to\nenergy production loss. To circumvent this problem, several tools and\ntechniques have been developed and used to enhance fault detection and\ndiagnosis to be found in the stator current signature for wind turbines\ngenerators. Among these methods, parametric or super-resolution frequency\nestimation methods, which provides typical spectrum estimation, can be useful\nfor this purpose. Facing on the plurality of these algorithms, a comparative\nperformance analysis is made to evaluate robustness based on different metrics:\naccuracy, dispersion, computation cost, perturbations and faults severity.\nFinally, simulation results in MATLAB with most occurring faults indicate that\nESPRIT and R-MUSIC algorithms have high capability of correctly identifying the\nfrequencies of fault characteristic components, a performance ranking had been\ncarried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the studied methods in faults\ndetecting.\n",

For the core problem of power balance, the\nlegacy paradigm of tailoring supply to follow random demand may be\ninappropriate under deep penetration of uncertain and intermittent renewable\ngeneration. In this situation, there is an emerging consensus that the\nalternative approach of controlling demand to follow random supply offers\ncompelling economic benefits in terms of reduced regulation costs. This\napproach exploits the flexibility of demand side resources and requires\nsensing, actuation, and communication infrastructure; distributed control\nalgorithms; and viable schemes to compensate participating loads. This paper\nconsiders rate-constrained energy services which are a specific paradigm for\nflexible demand. These services are characterized by a specified delivery\nwindow, the total amount of energy that must be supplied over this window, and\nthe maximum rate at which this energy may be delivered. We consider a forward\nmarket where rate-constrained energy services are traded. We explore allocation\npolicies and market decisions of a supplier in this market. The supplier owns a\ngeneration mix that includes some uncertain renewable generation and may also\npurchase energy in day-ahead and real-time markets to meet customer demand. The\nsupplier must optimally select the portfolio of rate-constrained services to\nsell, the amount of day-ahead energy to buy, and the policies for making\nreal-time energy purchases and allocations to customers to maximize its\nexpected profit. We offer solutions to the supplier's decision and control\nproblems to economically provide rate constrained energy services.\n",

The primary\ncontrol of each inverter is integrated through internal current and voltage\nloops using PR compensators, a virtual impedance, and an external power\ncontroller based on frequency and voltage droops. The frequency restoration\nfunction is implemented at the secondary control level, which executes a\nconsensus algorithm that consists of a load-frequency control and a single time\ndelay communication network. The consensus network consists of a time-invariant\ndirected graph and the output power of each inverter is the information shared\namong the units, which is affected by the time delay. The proposed small-signal\nmodel is validated through simulation results and experimental results. A root\nlocus analysis is presented that shows the behavior of the system considering\ncontrol parameters and time delay variation.\n",

As an added benefit, it greatly increases the\nachievable precision at nose points. The method is exemplified for the case of\nMvar limits in generators regulating voltage on both local and remote buses.\nBased on the framework of the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM), it\nprovides a rigorous solution to this fundamental problem by framing it in terms\nof \\emph{optimization}. A novel Lagrangian formulation of power-flow, which is\nexact for lossless networks, leads to a natural physics-based minimization\ncriterion that yields the correct solution. For networks with small losses, as\nis the case in transmission, the AC power flow problem cannot be framed exactly\nin terms of optimization, but the criterion still retains its ability to select\nthe correct solution. This foundation then provides a way to design a HELM\nscheme to solve for the minimizing solution. Although the use of barrier\nfunctions evokes interior point optimization, this method, like HELM, is based\non the analytic continuation of a germ (of a particular branch) of the\nalgebraic curve representing the solutions of the system. In this case, since\nthe constraint equations given by limits result in an unavoidable singularity\nat $s=1$, direct analytic continuation by means of standard Pad\\'e\napproximation is fraught with numerical instabilities. This has been overcome\nby means of a new analytic continuation procedure, denominated\nPad\\'e-Weierstrass, that exploits the covariant nature of the power flow\nequations under certain changes of variables. One colateral benefit of this\nprocedure is that it can also be used when limits are not being enforced, in\norder to increase the achievable numerical precision in highly stressed cases.\n",

Given a set of expert policies\ntrained on a state and action space, the goal is to maximize the cumulative\nreward of our agent. The hope is to quickly find the best expert in our set.\nThe MAB formulation allows us to quantify the performance of an algorithm in\nterms of the regret incurred from not choosing the best expert from the\nbeginning. We first develop the theoretical framework for MABs in MDPs, and\nthen present a basic regret decomposition identity. We then adapt the classical\nUpper Confidence Bounds algorithm to the problem of choosing experts in MDPs\nand prove that the expected regret grows at worst at a logarithmic rate.\nLastly, we validate the theory on a small MDP.\n",

Similarly, but at a slightly slower pace, novel services\nfor freight transportation and city logistics improve the efficiency of goods\ntransportation and change the use of road infrastructure. The present article\nprovides a general four-layer framework for modeling these new trends. The main\nmotivation behind the development is to provide a unifying formal system\ndescription that can at the same time encompass system physics (flow and motion\nof vehicles) as well as coordination strategies under various information and\ncooperation structures. To showcase the framework, we apply it to the specific\nchallenge of modeling and analyzing the integration of routing applications in\ntoday's transportation systems. In this framework, at the lowest layer (flow\ndynamics) we distinguish app users from non-app users. A distributed parameter\nmodel based on a non-local partial differential equation is introduced and\nanalyzed. The second layer incorporates connected services (e.g., routing) and\nother applications used to optimize the local performance of the system. As\ninputs to those applications, we propose a third layer introducing the\nincentive design and global objectives, which are typically varying over the\nday depending on road and weather conditions, external events etc. The\nhigh-level planning is handled on the fourth layer taking social long-term\nobjectives into account.\n",

Slow-rate sensing enables to achieve energy saving by\nreducing network load. In addition, choosing a slower sensing period than the\nlongest round-trip time delay can avoid packet disorder. On the other hand, a\nslow-rate sensing usually degrades control performance in a conventional\ncontrol framework. Therefore, including dual-rate control techniques can be\nuseful to maintain the desired performance, since the controller is able to\ngenerate a fast-rate control signal from a slow-rate sensing signal. A\ndual-rate PID controller is used, which can be split into two parts: a\nslow-rate PI controller is located at the remote side (with no permanent\ncommunication to the plant) and a fast-rate PD controller, at the local side\n(close to the plant, sensor, and inside the actuator, which can offer a low\ncomputation power). In addition, at the remote side, where a powerful\ncomputation device is located, a prediction stage is included in order to\ngenerate the packet of future, estimated slow-rate control actions to be sent\nto the local side. At this side, these actions are converted to fast-rate ones\nand used when a packet does not arrive due to the network-induced delay or due\nto occurring dropouts. The control proposal is able to reach the nominal\n(no-dropout, no-delay) performance despite the existence of time-varying delays\nand packet dropouts. Via real-time control for a Cartesian robot, results\nclearly reveal the superiority of the control approach compared to a previous\nauthors\\' proposal, where the time-varying delays are faced by means of a gain\nscheduling control strategy.\n",

This is relevant for\nspraying applications and related in-field work. Consequently, multiple returns\nto a mobile or stationary depot located outside of the field are required for\nstorage tank refilling. Therefore, a suitable path planning method is suggested\nthat accounts for the limited turning radii of agricultural vehicles, satisfies\ncompacted area minimisation constraints, and aims at overall path length\nminimisation. The benefits of the proposed method are illustrated by means of a\ncomparison to a planning method based on the more common AB pattern.

The known equivalence between phase-type distributions and positive\nlinear systems allows to leverage existing modeling tools, but possibly with\nlarge computational costs.

The results show that inverse covariance method has the best\ncomputational performance if the number of sensors is above 20. For a smaller\nnumber of sensors, other methods, especially group sensors, are more\nappropriate..\n",

The power\nbuffer adjusts its front-end converter control so that the buffer-load\ncombination would appear as a constant impedance load to the upstream supply\nsystem when depressed voltage occurs. A battery energy-storage back-up source\nwithin the buffer is activated to maintain the load power demand.

In terms of keeping the balance between\nsupply and demand, the usual scheme of supply following load may not be\nappropriate for large penetration levels of uncertain and intermittent\nrenewable supply. In this paper, we focus on an alternative scheme in which the\nload follows the supply, exploiting the flexibility associated with the demand\nside. We consider a model of flexible loads that are to be serviced by\nzero-marginal cost renewable power together with conventional generation if\nnecessary. Each load demands 1 kW for a specified number of time slots within\nan operational period. The flexibility of a load resides in the fact that the\nservice may be delivered over any slots within the operational period. Loads\ntherefore require flexible energy services that are differentiated by the\ndemanded duration. We focus on two problems associated with\ndurations-differentiated loads. The first problem deals with the operational\ndecisions that a supplier has to make to serve a given set of duration\ndifferentiated loads. The second problem focuses on a market implementation for\nduration differentiated services. We give necessary and sufficient conditions\nunder which the available power can service the loads, and we describe an\nalgorithm that constructs an appropriate allocation. In the event the available\nsupply is inadequate, we characterize the minimum amount of power that must be\npurchased to service the loads. Next we consider a forward market where\nconsumers can purchase duration differentiated energy services. We first\ncharacterize social welfare maximizing allocations in this forward market and\nthen show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium.\n",

This work introduces a\nnew analysis technique relying upon classical notions of persistence of\nexcitation to study the convergence properties of the time-varying multi-agent\ndynamics. Since the individual edge weights pass through singularities and vary\nwith time, the closed-loop dynamics consists of a non-autonomous linear system.\nInstead of simplifying to a piecewise continuous switched system as in\nliterature, smooth variations in edge weights are allowed, albeit assuming an\nunderlying persistence condition which characterizes sufficient inter-agent\ncommunication to reach consensus.

Problems of this type are referred to as single-task\nproblems. Nevertheless, there are several problems in practice that are\nmultitask-oriented in the sense that the optimum parameter vector may not be\nthe same for every node. This brings up the issue of studying the performance\nof the diffusion LMS algorithm when it is run, either intentionally or\nunintentionally, in a multitask environment. In this paper, we conduct a\ntheoretical analysis on the stochastic behavior of diffusion LMS in the case\nwhere the so-called single-task hypothesis is violated. We explain under what\nconditions diffusion LMS continues to deliver performance superior to\nnon-cooperative strategies in the multitask environment. When the conditions\nare violated, we explain how to endow the nodes with the ability to cluster\nwith other similar nodes to remove bias. We propose an unsupervised clustering\nstrategy that allows each node to select, via adaptive adjustments of\ncombination weights, the neighboring nodes with which it can collaborate to\nestimate a common parameter vector. Simulations are presented to illustrate the\ntheoretical results, and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nclustering strategy.

This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump\noperates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of\nactivating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a\nconstant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a\nthermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the\nset-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g. when the occupants are\nnot at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential\ndecision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. A\nfirst challenge is that for most residential buildings a description of the\nthermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to\nobtain. A second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e.\nthe building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to\novercome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with\na batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated\nfor two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in\nthe winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the\nproposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4-9% during 100\nwinter days and by 9-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional\nconstant set-point strategy\n",

Moreover, we improve the numerical\nstability of the sample computation, which allows us to accurately approximate\na thousand-dimensional Gaussian distribution using tens of thousands of\noptimally placed samples.

To reduce computational cost\nof time-domain simulations, direct energy methods have been extensively\ndeveloped. However, these methods, as well as other existing methods, still\nrely on time-consuming numerical integration of the fault-on dynamics. This\ntask is computationally hard, since possibly thousands of contingencies need to\nbe scanned and thousands of accompanied fault-on dynamics simulations need to\nbe performed and stored on a regular basis. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework to eliminate the need for fault-on dynamics simulations in\ncontingency screening. This simulation-free framework is based on bounding the\nfault-on dynamics and extending the recently introduced Lyapunov Function\nFamily approach for transient stability analysis of structure-preserving model.\nIn turn, a lower bound of the critical clearing time (CCT) is obtained by\nsolving convex optimization problems without relying on any time-domain\nsimulations.

This paper\nfocuses on optimizing the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm for both\nclassical and quantum networks. A novel model of the gossip algorithm with\nnon-uniform clock distribution is proposed which can reach the optimal\nconvergence rate of the continuous-time consensus algorithm. It is described\nthat how the non-uniform clock distribution is achievable by modifying the rate\nof the Poisson process modeling the clock of the gossip algorithm. The\nminimization problem for optimizing the asymptotic convergence rate of the\nproposed gossip algorithm and its corresponding semidefinite programming\nformulation is addressed analytically. It is shown that the optimal results\nobtained for uniform clock distribution are suboptimal compared to those of the\nnon-uniform one and for non-uniform distribution the optimal answer is not\nunique i.e. there is more than one set of probabilities that can achieve the\noptimal convergence rate. Based on the optimal continuous-time consensus\nalgorithm and the detailed balance property, an effective method of obtaining\none of these optimal answers is proposed. Regarding quantum gossip algorithm,\nby expanding the density matrix in terms of the generalized Gell-Mann matrices,\nthe evolution equation of the quantum gossip algorithm is transformed to the\nstate update equation of the classical gossip algorithm. By defining the\nquantum gossip operator, the original optimization problem is formulated as a\nconvex optimization problem, which can be addressed by semidefinite\nprogramming.\n",

Secure\nestimation problems study how to estimate the true system states when\nmeasurements are corrupted and/or control inputs are compromised by attackers.\nThe authors in [1] proposed a secure estimation method when the set of attacked\nnodes (sensors, controllers) is fixed. In this paper, we extend these results\nto scenarios in which the set of attacked nodes can change over time. We\nformulate this secure estimation problem into the classical error correction\nproblem [2] and we show that accurate decoding can be guaranteed under a\ncertain condition. Furthermore, we propose a combined secure estimation method\nwith our proposed secure estimator and the Kalman Filter for improved practical\nperformance. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our method through\nsimulations of two scenarios where an unmanned aerial vehicle is under\nadversarial attack.\n",

The work in this paper builds on the\npreviously proposed self-triggered pursuit strategy which guarantees capture of\nthe evader in finite time with a finite number of evader samples.

Instead, we extend our previous framework to\ndevelop an algorithm which allows for uncertainties in sampling the information\nabout the evader, and derive tolerable upper-bounds on the error such that the\npursuer can guarantee capture of the evader. In addition, we outline the\nadvantages of retaining the evader's history in improving the current estimate\nof the true location of the evader that can be used to capture the evader with\neven less samples. Our approach is in sharp contrast to the existing works in\nliterature and our results ensure capture without sacrificing any performance\nin terms of guaranteed time-to-capture, as compared to classic algorithms that\nassume continuous availability of information.\n",

        "summary": "  Platooning allows vehicles to travel with small intervehicle distance in a\ncoordinated fashion thanks to vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity. When applied at\na larger scale, platooning will create significant opportunities for energy\nsavings due to reduced aerodynamic drag, as well as increased road capacity and\ncongestion reduction resulting from shorter vehicle headways. However, these\npotential savings are maximized if platooning-capable vehicles spend most of\ntheir travel time within platoons. Ad hoc platoon formation may not ensure a\nhigh rate of platoon driving. In this paper we consider the problem of central\ncoordination of platooning-capable vehicles. By coordinating their routes and\ndeparture times, we can maximize the fuel savings afforded by platooning\nvehicles. The resulting problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that\nconsiders the platoon coordination and vehicle routing problems simultaneously.\nWe demonstrate our methodology by evaluating the benefits of a coordinated\nsolution and comparing it with the uncoordinated case when platoons form only\nin an ad hoc manner. We compare the coordinated and uncoordinated scenarios on\na grid network with different assumptions about demand and the time vehicles\nare willing to wait.\n",

We use this model to derive an optimization problem that protects power\nsystems from GIC impacts through line switching, generator redispatch, and load\nshedding. We employ state-of-the-art convex relaxations of AC power flow\nequations to lower bound the objective. We demonstrate the approach on a\nmodified RTS96 system and the UIUC 150-bus system and show that line switching\nis an effective means to mitigate GIC impacts.

The study of\nmaximum capability of feedback control was pioneered in Xie and Guo (2000) for\nscalar systems with nonparametric nonlinear uncertainty. In a network setting,\nnodes with unknown and nonlinear dynamics are interconnected through a directed\ninteraction graph. Nodes can design feedback controls based on all available\ninformation, where the objective is to stabilize the network state. Using\ninformation structure and decision pattern as criteria, we specify three\ncategories of network feedback laws, namely the\nglobal-knowledge/global-decision, network-flow/local-decision, and\nlocal-flow/local-decision feedback. We establish a series of network capacity\ncharacterizations for these three fundamental types of network control laws.\nFirst of all, we prove that for global-knowledge/global-decision and\nnetwork-flow/local-decision control where nodes know the information flow\nacross the entire network, there exists a critical number\n$\\big(3/2+\\sqrt{2}\\big)/\\|A_{\\mathrm{G}}\\|_\\infty$, where $3/2+\\sqrt{2}$ is as\nknown as the Xie-Guo constant and $A_{\\mathrm{G}}$ is the network adjacency\nmatrix, defining exactly how much uncertainty in the node dynamics can be\novercome by feedback.

EV routing problem is\nsolved to minimize the total cost of travel using the Dijkstra algorithm with\nthe input from EVs battery management system, electricity price from charging\nstations, powertrain component efficiencies, and transportation network traffic\nconditions.

LPV\ncontrollers are then designed to guarantee system stability, robustness and\nH-infinity performance. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy\nof the developed framework.\n",

Each\nnode has access to one of the linear equations and holds a dynamic state. The\naim for the node states is to reach a consensus as a least squares solution of\nthe linear equations by exchanging their states with neighbors over an\nunderlying interaction graph. A continuous-time distributed least squares\nsolver over networks is developed in the form of the famous Arrow-Hurwicz-Uzawa\nflow. A necessary and sufficient condition is established on the graph\nLaplacian for the continuous-time distributed algorithm to give the least\nsquares solution in the limit, with an exponentially fast convergence rate. The\nfeasibility of different fundamental graphs is discussed including path graph,\nstar graph, etc. Moreover, a discrete-time distributed algorithm is developed\nby Euler's method, converging exponentially to the least squares solution at\nthe node states with suitable step size and graph conditions. The exponential\nconvergence rate for both the continuous-time and discrete-time algorithms\nunder the established conditions is confirmed by numerical examples. Finally,\nwe investigate the performance of the proposed flow under switching networks,\nand surprisingly, switching networks at high switching frequencies can lead to\napproximate least square solvers even if all graphs in the switching signal\nfail to do so in the absence of structure switching.\n",

However, unregulated battery charging remains a\nchallenge causing high energy costs, power peaks or even blackouts. This paper\nstudies this challenge from a socio-technical perspective: social dynamics such\nas the participation in demand-response programs, the discomfort experienced by\nalternative suggested vehicle usage times and even the fairness in terms of how\nequally discomfort is experienced among the population are highly intertwined\nwith Smart Grid reliability. To address challenges of such a socio-technical\nnature, this paper introduces a fully decentralized and participatory learning\nmechanism for privacy-preserving coordinated charging control of electric\nvehicles that regulates three Smart Grid socio-technical aspects: (i)\nreliability, (ii) discomfort and (iii) fairness. In contrast to related work, a\nnovel autonomous software agent exclusively uses local knowledge to generate\nenergy demand plans for its vehicle that encode different battery charging\nregimes. Agents interact to learn and make collective decisions of which plan\nto execute so that power peaks and energy cost are reduced system-wide.\nEvaluation with real-world data confirms the improvement of drivers' comfort\nand fairness using the proposed planning method, while this improvement is\nassessed in terms of reliability and cost reduction under a varying number of\nparticipating vehicles.

To mitigate intermittent nature of renewable energy,\nenergy trading and energy storage which can exploit diversity of renewable\nenergy generation across space and time are efficient and cost-effective\nmethods.

A sensor transmits local state estimates over a packet dropping\nlink to a remote estimator, while an eavesdropper can successfully overhear\neach sensor transmission with a certain probability. The objective is to\ndetermine when the sensor should transmit, in order to minimize the estimation\nerror covariance at the remote estimator, while trying to keep the eavesdropper\nerror covariance above a certain level. This is done by solving an optimization\nproblem that minimizes a linear combination of the expected estimation error\ncovariance and the negative of the expected eavesdropper error covariance.\nStructural results on the optimal transmission policy are derived, and shown to\nexhibit thresholding behaviour in the estimation error covariances. In the\ninfinite horizon situation, it is shown that with unstable systems one can keep\nthe expected estimation error covariance bounded while the expected\neavesdropper error covariance becomes unbounded. An alternative measure of\nsecurity, constraining the amount of information revealed to the eavesdropper,\nis also considered, and similar structural results on the optimal transmission\npolicy are derived.

The identification of the local\nsystem matrices (up to a similarity transformation) is done via a low\ndimensional subspace retrieval step that enables the estimation of the Markov\nparameters of a locally lifted system. Using the estimated Markov parameters,\nthe state-space realization of a single subsystem in the network is determined.\nThe low dimensional subspace retrieval step exploits various key structural\nproperties that are present in the data equation such as a low rank property\nand a {\\em two-layer} Toeplitz structure in the data matrices constructed from\nproducts of the system matrices. For the estimation of the system matrices of a\nsingle subsystem, it is formulated as a structured low-rank matrix\nfactorization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed identification method\nis demonstrated by a simulation example.\n",

In this paper, a new approach for online rotor angle\nstability assessment is proposed to address this problem. The MLE is estimated\nby a recursive least square (RLS) based method based on real-time rotor angle\nmeasurements, and two critical parameters, the Theiler window and the MLE\nestimation initial time step, are carefully chosen to make sure the calculated\nMLE curves present distinct features for different stability conditions.

In most common situations, such a CHP is\nheat driven operated, meaning that the CHP will switch on whenever heat is\nneeded, while not taking into account the demand of electricity at that time.\nIn this paper however, an active control strategy is developed, aiming to\nmaximize the profit of the CHP, selling its electricity to the spot market. The\nCHP will therefore switch on at moments of high electricity prices.\nNevertheless, since there never is a perfect match between the demand of heat\nand the demand of electricity, a thermal energy storage is included in the\nnetwork to overcome the difference between supply and demand of heat in the\nnetwork. In this study, three different storage concepts are compared: (1) a\ncentral buffer tank next to the CHP; (2) small storage vessels distributed over\nthe different connected buildings; and (3) the use of the thermal mass if the\nbuildings as storage capacity. Besides the development of the control\nalgorithms based on model predictive control, a simulation model of the network\nis described to evaluate the performance of the different storage concept\nduring a representative winter week. The results show that the presented\ncontrol algorithm can significantly influence the heat demand profile of the\nconnected buildings. As a results, active control of the CHP can drastically\nincrease the profit of the CHP. The concept with the distributed buffers gives\nthe best results, however the profit for the thermal mass concept is only\nmarginally smaller. Since in this latter case no significant investment costs\nare needed, the conclusion for this case study is that the use of thermal mass\nof buildings for demand side management in district heating systems is very\npromising.\n",

Most of the solution techniques in SO\nestimate gradients from the noise corrupted observations of the objective and\nadjust parameters of the objective along the direction of the estimated\ngradients to obtain locally optimal solutions. Two prominent algorithms in SO\nnamely Random Direction Kiefer-Wolfowitz (RDKW) and Simultaneous Perturbation\nStochastic Approximation (SPSA) obtain noisy gradient estimate by randomly\nperturbing all the parameters simultaneously. This forces the search direction\nto be random in these algorithms and causes them to suffer additional noise on\ntop of the noise incurred from the samples of the objective. Owing to this\nadditional noise, the idea of using deterministic perturbations instead of\nrandom perturbations for gradient estimation has also been studied. Two\nspecific constructions of the deterministic perturbation sequence using\nlexicographical ordering and Hadamard matrices have been explored and\nencouraging results have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we\ncharacterize the class of deterministic perturbation sequences that can be\nutilized in the RDKW algorithm. This class expands the set of known\ndeterministic perturbation sequences available in the literature. Using our\ncharacterization we propose a construction of a deterministic perturbation\nsequence that has the least possible cycle length among all deterministic\nperturbations. Through simulations we illustrate the performance gain of the\nproposed deterministic perturbation sequence in the RDKW algorithm over the\nHadamard and the random perturbation counterparts.

It is well-known that if the time-varying vector field of\nthe system is periodic then the system admits a unique globally asymptotically\nstable periodic solution. Obtaining explicit information on this periodic\nsolution and its dependence on various parameters is important both\ntheoretically and in numerous applications. We develop an approach for\napproximating such a periodic trajectory using the periodic trajectory of a\nsimpler system (e.g. an LTI system). Our approximation includes an error bound\nthat is based on the input-to-state stability property of contractive systems.\nWe show that in some cases this error bound can be computed explicitly. We also\nuse the bound to derive a new theoretical result, namely, that a contractive\nsystem with an additive periodic input behaves like a low pass filter. We\ndemonstrate our results using several examples from systems biology.\n",

We propose a new\nretrofit control technique where an additional controller is designed at the\ndoubly-fed induction generator site inside the wind power plant. This\ncontroller cancels the adverse impacts of the power flow from the wind side to\nthe grid side on the dynamics of the overall power system. The main advantage\nof this controller is that it can be implemented by feeding back only the wind\nstates and wind bus voltage without depending on any of the other synchronous\nmachines in the rest of the system. Through simulations of a 4-machine Kundur\npower system model we show that the retrofit can efficiently enhance the\ndamping performance of the system variable despite very high values of wind\npenetration.\n",

The interest is mainly\nfocused on the assessment of suspension behaviour and, thus, on the\nidentification of the so-called vehicle rigid body modes. But issues arise when\nthe operational identification of a vehicle system is performed, basically\nrelated to the nature of the loads induced by the roughness of rolling\nprofiles. The forces exerted on the wheels, in fact, depending on their\nlocation, are affected by time and/or spatial correlation, and, more over, do\nnot fit the form of white noise sequences. Thus, the nature of the excitation\nstrongly violate the hypotheses on which the formulation of classical OMA modal\nmodel relies, leading to pronounced modelling errors and, in turn, to poorly\nestimated modal parameters. In this paper, we develop a specialised modal\nmodel, that we refer to as the Track-Vehicle Interaction Modal Model, able to\nincorporate the character of road/rail inputs acting on vehicles during\noperation. Since in this novel modal model the relationship between vehicle\nsystem outputs and modal parameters is given explicitly, the development of new\nspecific curve fitting techniques, in the time-lag or frequency domain, is now\npossible, making available simple and cost-effective tools for vehicle\noperational identification. More over, a second, but not less important outcome\nof the proposed modal model is the usage of the resulting techniques for the\nindirect characterisation of rolling surface roughness, that can be used to\nimprove comfort and safety.\n",

When independent states are considered, the optimum\nfusion rule over a batch of observations has already been derived, however its\ncomplexity prevents its use in conjunction with large observation windows.\n  In this paper, we propose a near-optimal algorithm based on message passing\nthat greatly reduces the computational burden of the optimum fusion rule.

Projectiles are subject to environment noise\nsuch as wind effect and measurement noise. In addition, mathematical models of\nprojectiles contain a large number of important states that should be taken\ninto account for having a realistic prediction. Furthermore, dynamics of\nprojectiles contain nonlinear functions such as monomials and sine functions.\nTo address all these issues we formulate a stochastic model for the projectile.\nWe showed that with a set of transformations projectile dynamics only contains\nnonlinearities of the form of monomials. In the next step we derived\napproximate moment dynamics of this system using mean-field approximation. Our\nmethod still suffers from size of the system. To address this problem we\nselected a subset of first- and second-order statistical moments and we showed\nthat they give reliable approximations of the mean and standard deviation of\nthe impact point for a real projectile. Finally we used these selected moments\nto derive a control law that reduces error to hit a desired point.\n",

Our analysis shows that GCI\nfusion with labeled multi-object densities strongly relies on label\nconsistencies between local multi-object posteriors at different sensor nodes,\nand hence suffers from a severe performance degradation when perfect label\nconsistencies are violated. Moreover, we mathematically analyze this phenomenon\nfrom the perspective of Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information and the\nso called yes-object probability. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a novel\nand general solution for the distributed fusion with labeled multi-object\ndensities that is robust to label inconsistencies between sensors.\nSpecifically, the labeled multi-object posteriors are firstly marginalized to\ntheir unlabeled posteriors which are then fused using GCI method. We also\nintroduce a principled method to construct the labeled fused density and\nproduce tracks formally. Based on the developed theoretical framework, we\npresent tractable algorithms for the family of generalized labeled\nmulti-Bernoulli (GLMB) filters including $\\delta$-GLMB, marginalized\n$\\delta$-GLMB and labeled multi-Bernoulli filters. The robustness and\nefficiency of the proposed distributed fusion algorithm are demonstrated in\nchallenging tracking scenarios via numerical experiments.\n",

The aim is to detect an adversary who\ndelivers fake sensor measurements to a system operator in order to conceal\ntheir effect on the plant. Physical watermarks, or noisy additive Gaussian\ninputs, have been previously used to detect several classes of integrity\nattacks in control systems. In this paper, we consider the analysis and design\nof Gaussian physical watermarks in the presence of packet drops at the control\ninput. On one hand, this enables analysis in a more general network setting. On\nthe other hand, we observe that in certain cases, Bernoulli packet drops can\nimprove detection performance relative to a purely Gaussian watermark. This\nmotivates the joint design of a Bernoulli-Gaussian watermark which incorporates\nboth an additive Gaussian input and a Bernoulli drop process. We characterize\nthe effect of such a watermark on system performance as well as attack\ndetectability in two separate design scenarios. Here, we consider a correlation\ndetector for attack recognition. We then propose efficiently solvable\noptimization problems to intelligently select parameters of the Gaussian input\nand the Bernoulli drop process while addressing security and performance\ntrade-offs. Finally, we provide numerical results which illustrate that a\nwatermark with packet drops can indeed outperform a Gaussian watermark.\n",

Second, heat or cool an\nentire zone even when the zone is only partially occupied. Both issues can be\nmitigated by using personal comfort systems (PCS) which bridge the comfort gap\nbetween what is provided by a central HVAC system and the personal preferences\nof the occupants. In recent work, we have proposed and deployed such a system,\ncalled SPOT.\n  We address the question, \"How should an existing HVAC system modify its\noperation to benefit the availability of PCS like SPOT?\" For example, energy\nconsumption could be reduced during sparse occupancy by choosing appropriate\nthermal set backs, with the PCS providing the additional offset in thermal\ncomfort required for each occupant. Our control strategy based on Model\nPredictive Control (MPC), employs a bi-linear thermal model, and has two\ntime-scales to accommodate the physical constraints that limit certain\ncomponents of the central HVAC system from frequently changing their set\npoints.\n  We compare the energy consumption and comfort offered by our SPOT-aware HVAC\nsystem with that of a state-of-the-art MPC-based central HVAC system in\nmultiple settings including different room layouts and partial deployment of\nPCS. Numerical evaluations show that our system obtains, in average, 45% (15%)\nsavings in energy in summer (winter), compared with the benchmark system for\nthe case of homogeneous comfort requirements. For heterogeneous comfort\nrequirements, we observe 51% (29%) improvement in comfort in summer (winter) in\naddition to significant savings in energy.\n",

The proposed approach\nsolves a stochastic, nonlinear differential equation model of the system in an\nanalytical way by the Adomian decomposition method and generates\nsemi-analytical solutions that express both deterministic and stochastic state\nvariables explicitly as symbolic variables so as to embed stochastic processes\ndirectly into the solutions for efficient stability analysis with\nuncertainties. The proposed approach is tested on the New England 10-machine\n39-bus system with different penetration levels of stochastic loads.

The proposed controller preserves the pH structure and,\nby adding to the new energy function a suitable cross term between the plant\nand the controller coordinates, it avoids the unnatural coordinate\ntransformation used in the past. This paper extends our previous work by\nrelaxing the requirement that the systems Hamiltonian is strictly convex and\nseparable, which allows the controller to be applied to a large class of\nmechanical systems, including underactuated systems with non-constant mass\nmatrix. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed integral action control is\nrobust against unknown damping in the case of fully-actuated systems.\n",

More precisely, the distributed\ndelay terms under consideration can contain any $\\fL^{2}$ functions which are\napproximated via a class of elementary functions which includes the option of\nLegendre polynomials. By using this broader class of functions compared to the\nexisting Legendre polynomials approximation approach, one can construct a\nLiapunov-Krasovskii functional which is parameterized by non-polynomial\nfunctions . Furthermore, a novel generalized integral inequality is also\nproposed to incorporate approximation error in our stability (dissipativity)\nconditions. Based on the proposed approximation scenario with the proposed\nintegral inequality, sufficient conditions determining the dissipativity and\nstability of a CDDS are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. In\naddition, several hierarchies in terms of the feasibility of the proposed\nconditions are derived under certain constraints.

These coefficients are interpreted in terms of poles and\ntransmission zeros of the underlying dynamical system. We present a method to\ncompute the MIMO cepstrum based on input/output signal data for systems with\nsquare transfer function matrices (i.e. systems with as many inputs as\noutputs). This allows us to do a model-free analysis. Two examples to\nillustrate these results are included: a simple MIMO system with 3 inputs and 3\noutputs, of which the poles and zeros are known exactly, that allows us to\ndirectly verify the equivalences derived in the paper, and a case study on\nrealistic data. This case study analyses data coming from a (model of) a\nnon-isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor, which experiences linear\nfouling. We analyse normal and faulty operating behaviour, both with and\nwithout a controller present. We show that the cepstrum detects faulty\nbehaviour, even when hidden by controller compensation.

This paper\naims at addressing this problem by introducing a model predictive safety\ncertification (MPSC) scheme for polytopic linear systems with additive\ndisturbances. The scheme verifies safety of a proposed learning-based input and\nmodifies it as little as necessary in order to keep the system within a given\nset of constraints. Safety is thereby related to the existence of a model\npredictive controller (MPC) providing a feasible trajectory towards a safe\ntarget set. A robust MPC formulation accounts for the fact that the model is\ngenerally uncertain in the context of learning, which allows proving constraint\nsatisfaction at all times under the proposed MPSC strategy. The MPSC scheme can\nbe used in order to expand any potentially conservative set of safe states for\nlearning and we prove an iterative technique for enlarging the safe set.\nFinally, a practical data-based design procedure for MPSC is proposed using\nscenario optimization.\n",

In order to keep track\nof a faithful and accurate list of transactions, the ledger is broadcast and\nreplicated across machines in a peer-to-peer network. To enforce validity of\ntransactions in the ledger (i.e., no negative balance or double spending), the\nnetwork as a whole coordinates to accept or reject new transactions based on a\nset of rules aiming to detect and block operations of malicious agents (i.e.,\nByzantine attacks). Consensus protocols are particularly important to\ncoordinate operation of the network, since they are used to reconcile\npotentially conflicting versions of the ledger. Regardless of architecture and\nconsensus mechanism used, resulting economic networks remain largely similar,\nwith economic agents driven by incentives under a set of rules. Due to the\nintense activity in this area, proper mathematical frameworks to model and\nanalyze behavior of blockchain-enabled systems are essential. In this paper, we\naddress this need and provide the following contributions: (i) we establish a\nformal framework, with tools from dynamical systems theory, to mathematically\ndescribe core concepts in blockchain-enabled networks, (ii) we apply this\nframework to the Bitcoin network and recover its key properties, and (iii) we\nconnect our modeling framework with powerful tools from control engineering,\nsuch as Lyapunov-like functions, to properly engineer economic systems with\nprovable properties. Apart from the aforementioned contributions, the\nmathematical framework herein proposed lays a foundation for engineering more\ngeneral economic systems built on emerging Turing complete networks, such as\nthe Ethereum network, through which complex alternative economic models are\nexplored.\n",

Since CACC strategies entail continuous information\nbroadcasting, communication failures can occur in congested CAV traffic\nnetworks, leading to a platoon's IFT varying dynamically. To enhance the\nperformance of CACC strategies, this study proposes the idea of dynamically\noptimizing the IFT for CACC, labeled the CACC-OIFT strategy. Under CACC-OIFT,\nthe vehicles in the platoon cooperatively determine in real-time which vehicles\nwill dynamically deactivate or activate the \"send\" functionality of their V2V\ncommunication devices to generate IFTs that optimize the platoon performance in\nterms of string stability under the ambient traffic conditions. Given the\nadaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller with a\ntwo-predecessor-following scheme, and the ambient traffic conditions and the\nplatoon size just before the start of a time period, the IFT optimization model\ndetermines the optimal IFT that maximizes the expected string stability. The\noptimal IFT is deployed for that time period, and the adaptive PD controller\ncontinuously determines the car-following behaviors of the vehicles based on\nthe unfolding degeneration scenario for each time instant within that period.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed CACC-OIFT is validated through numerical\nexperiments in NS-3 based on NGSIM field data. The results indicate that the\nproposed CACC-OIFT can significantly enhance the string stability of platoon\ncontrol in an unreliable V2V communication context, outperforming CACCs with\nfixed IFTs or with passive adaptive schemes for IFT dynamics.\n",

We\nalso propose optimization-based heuristics for input generation for cases when\nthe state is outside the winning set of the dual game.

The present paper seeks to fill this gap.\nWe use a Markov modulated fluid queue to model the loss of load probability\n(LOLP) associated with a renewable generator bundled with a battery, serving an\nuncertain demand process. Further, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of\nthe LOLP as the battery size scales to infinity. Our results shed light on the\nfundamental limits of reliability achievable, and also guide the sizing of the\nstorage required in order to meet a given reliability target. Finally, we\npresent a case study using real-world wind power data to demonstrate the\napplicability of our results in practice.\n",

Specifically, we propose a simultaneous approach\nand a sequential approach, respectively, based on the proportional-integral\n(PI) feedback controller to iteratively adjust the JDTT and JDDT, and use a\ncalibrated large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model\nof Melbourne, Australia to evaluate the network performance under different\npricing scenarios. While the framework is developed for static pricing, we show\nthat it can be easily extended to solve time-dependent pricing by using\nmultiple PI controllers. Results show that although the distance toll keeps the\nnetwork from entering the congested regime of the NFD, it naturally drives\nusers into the shortest paths within the cordon resulting in an uneven\ndistribution of congestion. This is reflected by a large clockwise hysteresis\nloop in the NFD. In contrast, both the JDTT and JDDT reduce the size of the\nhysteresis loop while achieving the same control objective.\n",

These shift registers are among the simplest nonlinear feedback shift\nregisters (FSRs) whose orbit lengths can be determined by feasible computation.\nIn general such a problem for nonlinear FSRs involves infeasible computation.\nThe dynamical systems whose model includes such FSRs are termed as Periodic\nFinite State systems (PFSS). This paper advances theory of such dynamical\nsystems. Due to the finite field valued coefficients, the theory of such\nsystems turns out to be radically different from that of linear continuous or\ndiscrete time periodic systems with real coefficients well known in literature.\nA special finite field version of the Floquet theory of such periodic systems\nis developed and the structure of trajectories of the PFSS is analyzed through\nthat of a shift invariant linear system after Floquet transformation. The\nconcept of extension of a dynamical system is proposed for such systems\nwhenever the equivalent shift invariant system can be obtained over an\nextension field.\n",

It is much more time efficient to first quantify the\ninteractions between component failures with fewer original cascades from a\nmore detailed cascading failure model and then perform the interaction model\nsimulation than it is to directly simulate a large number of cascades with a\nmore detailed model. Interaction-based mitigation measures are suggested to\nmitigate cascading failure risk by weakening key links, which can be achieved\nin real systems by wide area protection such as blocking of some specific\nprotective relays.

The computational and\nmemory complexity of the approximation algorithms are $O(N)$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of local subsystems of the interconnected system.

For linear systems, the\npaper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for exponential mean square\nstability, based on linear matrix inequalities. In both the linear and\nnonlinear cases, the Lyapunov inequalities are constructed from a simple linear\ncombination of the classical inequalities from continuous and discrete time.\nCrucially, the stability theorems only depend on the mean sampling intervals.\nThus, they can be applied with only limited statistical information about the\nclocks.

For two traces, from $[0,T]$ to values in a metric space $O$,\nit measures the best match between the traces when allowed continuous bijective\ntiming distortions. Formally, it computes the infimum, over all timing\ndistortions, of the maximum of two components: the first component quantifies\nthe {\\em timing discrepancy} of the timing distortion, and the second\nquantifies the mismatch (in the metric space $O$) of the values under the\ntiming distortion. Skorokhod distances appear in various fundamental hybrid\nsystems analysis concerns: from definitions of hybrid systems semantics and\nnotions of equivalence, to practical problems such as checking the closeness of\nmodels or the quality of simulations. Despite its popularity and extensive\ntheoretical use, the \\emph{computation} problem for the Skorokhod distance\nbetween two finite sampled-time hybrid traces has remained open.\n  We address in this work the problem of computing the Skorokhod distance\nbetween two polygonal traces (these traces arise when sampled-time traces are\ncompleted by linear interpolation between sample points). We provide the first\nalgorithm to compute the exact Skorokhod distance when trace values are in\n$\\reals^n$ for the $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_{\\infty}$ norms.

These demands come at the cost of\na growing computational burden and, as a result, larger controller latencies.\nTo maximize robustness to mechanical disturbances by maximizing control\nfeedback gains, this paper emphasizes the necessity for compromise between\nhigh- and low-level feedback control effort in distributed controllers.\nSpecifically, the effect of distributed impedance controllers is studied where\ndamping feedback effort is executed in close proximity to the control plant and\nstiffness feedback effort is executed in a latency-prone centralized control\nprocess. A central observation is that the stability of high impedance\ndistributed controllers is very sensitive to damping feedback delay but much\nless to stiffness feedback delay. This study pursues a detailed analysis of\nthis observation that leads to a physical understanding of the disparity. Then\na practical controller breakdown gain rule is derived to aim at enabling\ncontrol designers to consider the benefits of implementing their control\napplications in a distributed fashion.

Compared to the well-established\noptimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metric, GOSPA is unnormalized as a\nfunction of the cardinality and it penalizes cardinality errors differently,\nwhich enables us to express it as an optimisation over assignments instead of\npermutations. An important consequence of this is that GOSPA allows us to\npenalize localization errors for detected targets and the errors due to missed\nand false targets, as indicated by traditional multiple target tracking (MTT)\nperformance measures, in a sound manner. In addition, we extend the GOSPA\nmetric to the space of random finite sets, which is important to evaluate MTT\nalgorithms via simulations in a rigorous way.\n",

Abnormalities in the heart's\nelectrical behaviour can be managed with a cardiac pacemaker. Recently, the\nclosed-loop testing of pacemakers with an emulation (real-time simulation) of\nthe heart has been proposed. An emulated heart would provide realistic\nreactions to the pacemaker as if it were a real heart. This enables developers\nto interrogate their pacemaker design without having to engage in costly or\nlengthy clinical trials. Many high-fidelity heart models have been developed,\nbut are too computationally intensive to be simulated in real-time. Heart\nmodels, designed specifically for the closed-loop testing of pacemakers, are\ntoo abstract to be useful in the testing of physical pacemakers.\n  In the context of pacemaker testing, this paper presents a more\ncomputationally efficient heart model that generates realistic continuous-time\nelectrical signals. The heart model is composed of cardiac cells that are\nconnected by paths. Significant improvements were made to an existing cardiac\ncell model to stabilise its activation behaviour and to an existing path model\nto capture the behaviour of continuous electrical propagation.

In particular, we will show\nthat the convergence time increases as the time interval between two messages\nincreases.

To address\nthis, the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and a nonlinear observer are introduced\nand implemented. Various Kalman filters and the observer are then tested on the\n16-machine, 68-bus system given realistic scenarios under model uncertainty and\ndifferent types of cyber attacks against synchrophasor measurements. It is\nshown that CKF and the observer are more robust to model uncertainty and cyber\nattacks than their counterparts.

First,\nthe input-output feedback linearization method is utilized assuming that the\ninternal dynamics is Input-to-State Stable (ISS) to obtain linearized\nsubsystems of agents. Consequently, we propose local dynamic controllers for\nagents such that the linearized subsystems have an identical closed-loop\ndynamics which has a single pole at the origin whereas other poles are on the\nopen left half complex plane. This allows us to deal with distinct agents\nhaving arbitrarily vector relative degrees and to derive rank-$1$ cooperative\ncontrol inputs for those homogeneous linearized dynamics which results in a\nminimum rank distributed dynamic consensus controller for the initial nonlinear\nMAS. Moreover, we prove that the coupling strength in the consensus protocol\ncan be arbitrarily small but positive and hence our consensus design is\nnon-conservative. Next, our design approach is further strengthened by tackling\nthe problem of randomly switching communication topologies among agents where\nwe relax the assumption on the balance of each switched graph and derive a\ndistributed rank-$1$ dynamic consensus controller. Lastly, a numerical example\nis introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n",

We analyze the effects of also\nconsidering noise in the measurement model, by developing a SOC algorithm based\non risk-sensitive control, that includes the dynamics of an observer in such a\nway that the control law explicitly depends on the current measurement\nuncertainty. In simulation results on a simple 2D manipulator, we have observed\nthat measurement uncertainty leads to low impedance behaviors, a result in\ncontrast with the effects of process noise that creates stiff behaviors.

The main contribution of this\npaper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified\nframework. We focus on three aspects: i) robustness of the estimation in the\npresence of noise; ii) computational cost; and, iii) convergence. A unifying\nmathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each\ntraining method provides better validation results, being parallel training\nbetter in what is believed to be more realistic scenarios. An example using\nmeasured data seems to reinforce such claim. We also show, with a novel\ncomplexity analysis and numerical examples, that both methods have similar\ncomputational cost, being series series-parallel training, however, more\namenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and\nconvergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.\n",

In this part of this paper, we show that the\nconventional deterministic and random gossip algorithms can be used to realize\nthe PPSC mechanism over a given network. At each time step, a node is selected\nto interact with one of its neighbors via deterministic or random gossiping.\nSuch node generates a random number as its new state, and sends the subtraction\nbetween its current state and that random number to the neighbor; then the\nneighbor updates its state by adding the received value to its current state.\nWe establish concrete privacy-preservation conditions by proving the\nimpossibility for the reconstruction of the network input from the output of\nthe gossip-based PPSC mechanism against eavesdroppers with full network\nknowledge, and by showing that the PPSC mechanism can achieve differential\nprivacy at arbitrary privacy levels. The convergence is characterized\nexplicitly and analytically for both deterministic and randomized gossiping,\nwhich is essentially achieved in a finite number of steps. Additionally, we\nillustrate that the proposed algorithms can be easily made adaptive in\nreal-world applications by making realtime trade-offs between resilience\nagainst node dropout or communication failure and privacy preservation\ncapabilities.\n",

In this regard, exploiting unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) swarms is a promising solution to inspect vast areas efficiently\nand with low cost. In fact, UAVs can easily fly and reach inspection points,\nrecord surveillance data, and send this information to a wireless base station\n(BS). Nonetheless, in many cases, such as operations at remote areas, the UAVs\ncannot be guided directly by the BS in real-time to find their path. Moreover,\nanother key challenge of inspection by UAVs is the limited battery capacity.\nThus, realizing the vision of autonomous inspection via UAVs requires\nenergy-efficient path planning that takes into account the energy constraint of\neach individual UAV. In this paper, a novel path planning algorithm is proposed\nfor performing energy-efficient inspection, under stringent energy availability\nconstraints for each UAV. The developed framework takes into account all\naspects of energy consumption for a UAV swarm during the inspection operations,\nincluding energy required for flying, hovering, and data transmission.

Although ergodic control\nhas shown promising experimental results, there is little understanding of why\nit works or when it is optimal. In this paper, we study a problem class under\nwhich optimal information gathering trajectories are ergodic.

The Monte Carlo Neyman-Pearson test we develop is useful when one has\na reliable model of faulty data, while the Fisher one is applicable when one\nmay not have a model of faults, which may occur when dealing with third-party\ndata, like GNSS data of transportation system users. These statistical tests\ncan be combined with a particle filter to obtain a Monte Carlo state estimation\nscheme that is robust to faulty or outlier data. We present a synthetic freeway\ntraffic state estimation problem where the filters are able to reject simulated\nfaulty GNSS measurements. The fault-model-free Fisher filter, while\nunderperforming the Neyman-Pearson one when the latter has an accurate fault\nmodel, outperforms it when the assumed fault model is incorrect.\n",

Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM),\nalso known as Cooperative Intersection Management (CIM) is among the more\nchallenging traffic problems that poses important questions related to safety\nand optimization in terms of delays, fuel consumption, emissions and\nreliability. Previously we introduced two stop-sign based policies for\nautonomous intersection management that were compatible with platoons of\nautonomous vehicles.

Simulation experiments were conducted for a wide range of\ntraffic conditions - from free flow to saturated traffic in two scenarios:\nanhattan-like grid road network, and arterial road. Results of the simulations\nshow that the proposed HCA-based traffic control strategy achieves better\neffectiveness in comparison with the state-of-the-art back pressure algorithm.\n",

Examples of\nthe loss of physical stability include the Northeast blackout of 2003 in North\nAmerica and the 2015 system-wide blackout in Ukraine. The nonlinear hybrid\nnature, that is, nonlinear continuous dynamics integrated with discrete\nswitching, and the high degree of freedom property of power system dynamics\nmake it challenging to conduct the dynamic security analysis. In this paper, we\nuse the hybrid automaton model to describe the dynamics of a power system and\nmainly deal with the index-1 differential-algebraic equation models regarding\nthe continuous dynamics in different discrete states. The analysis problem is\nformulated as a reachability problem of the associated hybrid model. A\nsampling-based algorithm is then proposed by integrating modeling and\nrandomized simulation of the hybrid dynamics to search for a feasible execution\nconnecting an initial state of the post-fault system and a target set in the\ndesired operation mode. The proposed method enables the use of existing power\nsystem simulators for the synthesis of discrete switching and control\nstrategies through randomized simulation. The effectiveness and performance of\nthe proposed approach are demonstrated with an application to the dynamic\nsecurity analysis of the New England 39-bus benchmark power system exhibiting\nhybrid dynamics. In addition to evaluating the dynamic security, the proposed\nmethod searches for a feasible strategy to ensure the dynamic security of the\nsystem in face of disruptions.\n",

The integral of the squared norm of the system output over a bounded\ntime interval is interpreted as energy. The cumulants of the output energy in\nthe infinite-horizon limit are related to Schatten norms of the system in the\nHardy space of transfer functions and the risk-sensitive performance index. We\nemploy a novel performance criterion which seeks to minimize a combination of\nthe average value and the variance of the output energy of the system per unit\ntime. The resulting linear quadro-quartic Gaussian control problem involves the\nH2 and H4-norms of the closed-loop system. We obtain equations for the optimal\ncontroller and outline a homotopy method which reduces the solution of the\nproblem to the numerical integration of a differential equation initialized by\nthe standard linear quadratic Gaussian controller.\n",

To make DPS approaches work well, one crucial issue\nis to select an appropriate space of parameterized policies with respect to the\ntargeted problem. A fundamental issue in LT approaches is that, to take good\ndecisions, such policies must develop very large look-ahead trees which may\nrequire excessive online computational resources. In this paper, we propose a\nnew hybrid policy learning scheme that lies at the intersection of DPS and LT,\nin which the policy is an algorithm that develops a small look-ahead tree in a\ndirected way, guided by a node scoring function that is learned through DPS.\nThe LT-based representation is shown to be a versatile way of representing\npolicies in a DPS scheme, while at the same time, DPS enables to significantly\nreduce the size of the look-ahead trees that are required to take high-quality\ndecisions.\n  We experimentally compare our method with two other state-of-the-art DPS\ntechniques and four common LT policies on four benchmark domains and show that\nit combines the advantages of the two techniques from which it originates. In\nparticular, we show that our method: (1) produces overall better performing\npolicies than both pure DPS and pure LT policies, (2) requires a substantially\nsmaller number of policy evaluations than other DPS techniques, (3) is easy to\ntune and (4) results in policies that are quite robust with respect to\nperturbations of the initial conditions.\n",

A simple one-dimensional discrete-time model is used to analyze\nthe boost or buck converter in discontinuous conduction mode. Seven different\ncontrol schemes (open-loop power stage, voltage mode control, current mode\ncontrol, constant power load, constant current load, constant-on-time control,\nand boundary conduction mode) are analyzed systematically. The linearized\ndynamics is obtained simply by taking partial derivatives with respect to\ndynamic variables. In the discrete-time model, there is only a single pole and\nno zero. The single closed-loop pole is a linear combination of three terms:\nthe open-loop pole, a term due to the control scheme, and a term due to the\nnon-resistive load. Even with a single pole, the phase response of the\ndiscrete-time model can go beyond -90 degrees as in the two-pole average\nmodels. In the boost converter with a resistive load under current mode\ncontrol, adding the compensating ramp has no effect on the pole location.\nIncreasing the ramp slope decreases the DC gain of control-to-output transfer\nfunction and increases the audio-susceptibility.

A specialized local optimization scheme for UQP is introduced and\nshown to yield superior results compared to general local optimization methods.\nFurthermore, a \\textbf{m}onotonically \\textbf{er}ror-bound \\textbf{i}mproving\n\\textbf{t}echnique (MERIT) is proposed to obtain the global optimum or a local\noptimum of UQP with good sub-optimality guarantees. The provided sub-optimality\nguarantees are case-dependent and generally outperform the $\\pi/4$\napproximation guarantee of semi-definite relaxation. Several numerical examples\nare presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The\nexamples show that for cases including several matrix structures used in radar\ncode design, MERIT can solve UQP efficiently in the sense of sub-optimality\nguarantee and computational time.\n",

By exploiting the\nmulti-antenna configuration and using all the TOA measurements up to current\ntime step, the relative clock bias at each receiver and the target position are\njointly estimated by solving a nonlinear least-squares (NLS) problem. To this\nend, a novel time recursive algorithm is proposed which fully takes advantage\nof the problem structure to achieve computational efficiency while using\northogonal transformations to ensure numerical reliability.

This is, of course, a central question in problems\ninvolving \"Big Data.\" Often a key assumption is that measurement errors in each\nvariable are independent. This precise formulation has its roots in the work of\nCharles Spearman in 1904 and of Ragnar Frisch in the 1930's. Various topics\nsuch as errors-in-variables, factor analysis, and instrumental variables, all\nrefer to alternative formulations of the problem of how to account for the\nanticipated way that noise enters in the data. In the present paper we begin by\ndescribing the basic theory and provide alternative modern proofs to some key\nresults. We then go on to consider certain generalizations of the theory as\nwell applying certain novel numerical techniques to the problem. A central role\nis played by the Frisch-Kalman dictum which aims at a noise contribution that\nallows a maximal set of simultaneous linear relations among the noise-free\nvariables --a rank minimization problem. In the years since Frisch's original\nformulation, there have been several insights including trace minimization as a\nconvenient heuristic to replace rank minimization. We discuss convex\nrelaxations and certificates guaranteeing global optimality. A complementary\npoint of view to the Frisch-Kalman dictum is introduced in which models lead to\na min-max quadratic estimation error for the error-free variables.

Such a non-stationary environment\nemerges when large-scale failures occur at power distribution networks due to\nexternal disturbances such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution\nnetworks lie at the edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external\ndisruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn\nnon-stationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power\ndistribution. This work studies such non-stationary behaviors in three aspects.\nFirst, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale\nfailure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of\nfailure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geo-location based\nmultivariate non-stationary GI(t)/G(t)/Infinity queues. Third, the\nnon-stationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to\nbe learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale\ndisruptions.

Thus, when the filter's gains are held fixed, and the filter admits\nalmost-global convergence properties with noise turned off, the noisy error's\ndistribution is proved to converge to a stationary distribution, providing\ninsight into the mathematical theory of filtering on Lie groups.

Even worse, most of practical systems are too complicated\nto establish their accurate mathematical model. To overcome these difficulties,\nwe propose a data-based approximate policy iteration (API) method by using real\nsystem data rather than system model. Firstly, a model-free policy iteration\nalgorithm is derived for constrained optimal control problem and its\nconvergence is proved, which can learn the solution of HJB equation and optimal\ncontrol policy without requiring any knowledge of system mathematical model.\nThe implementation of the algorithm is based on the thought of actor-critic\nstructure, where actor and critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to\napproximate the control policy and cost function, respectively. To update the\nweights of actor and critic NNs, a least-square approach is developed based on\nthe method of weighted residuals. The whole data-based API method includes two\nparts, where the first part is implemented online to collect real system\ninformation, and the second part is conducting offline policy iteration to\nlearn the solution of HJB equation and the control policy. Then, the data-based\nAPI algorithm is simplified for solving unconstrained optimal control problem\nof nonlinear and linear systems.

Each evening, these bats emerge from a cave in sequences of small\ngroups that typically contain no more than three or four individuals, and they\nthus provide ideal subjects for studying leader-follower behaviors.

The martingale stands for the level of risk tolerance over\ntime. By augmenting the system dynamics with the controlled martingale, the\noriginal risk-constrained problem is transformed into a stochastic target\nproblem. We extend the incremental Markov Decision Process (iMDP) algorithm to\napproximate arbitrarily well an optimal feedback policy of the original problem\nby sampling in the augmented state space and computing proper boundary\nconditions for the reformulated problem. We show that the algorithm is both\nprobabilistically sound and asymptotically optimal. The performance of the\nproposed algorithm is demonstrated on motion planning and control problems\nsubject to bounded probability of collision in uncertain cluttered\nenvironments.\n",

In the method, the\nmaximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation are ensured to be\nwithin prescribed levels, while at the same time maintaining a good\nlinear-phase characteristic at a prescribed group delay in the passband. Since\nthe beamformer is intended primarily for small-sized microphone arrays where\nthe microphone spacing is small relative to the wavelength at low frequencies,\nthe beamformer can become highly sensitive to spatial white noise and array\nimperfections if a direct minimization of the error is performed. Therefore, to\nlimit the sensitivity of the beamformer the optimization is carried out by\nconstraining a sensitivity parameter, namely, the white noise gain (WNG) to be\nabove prescribed levels across the frequency band. Two novel design variants\nhave been developed. The first variant is formulated as a convex optimization\nproblem where the maximum error in the passband is minimized, while the second\nvariant is formulated as an iterative optimization problem and has the\nadvantage of significantly improving the linear-phase characteristics of the\nbeamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear-array configuration. In\nthe second variant, the passband group-delay deviation is minimized while\nensuring that the maximum passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within\nprescribed levels. To reduce the computational effort in carrying out the\noptimization, a nonuniform variable sampling approach over the frequency and\nangular dimensions is used to compute the required parameters. Experiment\nresults show that beamformers designed using the proposed methods have much\nsmaller passband group-delay deviation for similar passband ripple and stopband\nattenuation than a modified version of an existing method.\n",

Despite the implementation of numerous and\ndifferent models for estimating soil erosion by water in Europe, there is still\na lack of harmonization of assessment methodologies.\n  Often, different approaches result in soil erosion rates significantly\ndifferent. Even when the same model is applied to the same region the results\nmay differ. This can be due to the way the model is implemented (i.e. with the\nselection of different algorithms when available) and/or to the use of datasets\nhaving different resolution or accuracy. Scientific computation is emerging as\none of the central topic of the scientific method, for overcoming these\nproblems there is thus the necessity to develop reproducible computational\nmethod where codes and data are available.\n  The present study illustrates this approach. Using only public available\ndatasets, we applied the Revised Universal Soil loss Equation (RUSLE) to locate\nthe most sensitive areas to soil erosion by water in Europe.\n  A significant effort was made for selecting the better simplified equations\nto be used when a strict application of the RUSLE model is not possible. In\nparticular for the computation of the Rainfall Erosivity factor (R) the\nreproducible research paradigm was applied. The calculation of the R factor was\nimplemented using public datasets and the GNU R language. An easily\nreproducible validation procedure based on measured precipitation time series\nwas applied using MATLAB language. Designing the computational modelling\narchitecture with the aim to ease as much as possible the future reuse of the\nmodel in analysing climate change scenarios is also a challenging goal of the\nresearch.\n",

The\nprecise values of the system parameters are unknown, but assumed to belong to a\nfinite set (i.e., there exist only finitely many possible models for the\nplant). Uncertainty is dealt with using a min-max approach (i.e., we seek the\nbest control for the worst possible plant). The optimal control is derived\nusing a multi-model version of Lagrange's multipliers method, which specifies\nthe control in terms of a discrete-time Riccati equation and an optimization\nproblem over a simplex. A numerical algorithm for computing the optimal control\nis proposed and tested by simulation.\n",

This criterion was used to prove\nthat a network of identical CFS can be synchronized under sufficiently strong\nlinear diffusive coupling. A very important class of CFS consists of biological\noscillators, named after Brian Goodwin and describing self-regulated chains of\nenzymatic reactions, where the product of each reaction catalyzes the next\nreaction, while the last product inhibits the first reaction in the chain.\nGoodwin's oscillators are used, in particular, to model the dynamics of genetic\ncircadian pacemakers, hormonal cycles and some metabolic pathways. In this\npaper we point out that for Goodwin's oscillators, where the individual\nreactions have nonlinear (e.g. Mikhaelis-Menten) kinetics, the synchronization\ncriterion, obtained by Hamadeh et al., cannot be directly applied. This\ncriterion relies on the implicit assumption of the solution boundedness,\ndictated also by the chemical feasibility (the state variables stand for the\nconcentrations of chemicals). Furthermore, to test the synchronization\ncondition one needs to know an explicit bound for a solution, which generally\ncannot be guaranteed under linear coupling. At the same time, we show that\nthese restrictions can be avoided for a nonlinear synchronization protocol,\nwhere the control inputs are \"saturated\" by a special nonlinear function\n(belonging to a wide class), which guarantees nonnegativity of the solutions\nand allows to get explicit ultimate bounds for them.

Temporal logic (TL) can address very complex task specification\nsuch as safety, coverage, motion sequencing etc. We use metric temporal logic\n(MTL) to encode the task specifications with timing constraints. We then\ntranslate the MTL formulae into mixed integer linear constraints and solve the\nassociated optimization problem using a mixed integer linear program solver.\nThis approach is different from the automata based methods which generate a\nfinite abstraction of the environment and dynamics, and use an automata\ntheoretic approach to formally generate a path that satisfies the TL. We have\napplied our approach on several case studies in complex dynamical environments\nsubjected to timed temporal specifications.\n",

Such a\nsystem is equivalent to one where the dynamics and costs are coupled across\nagents through the mean-field (or empirical mean) of the states and actions\n(even when the primitive random variables are non-exchangeable). Two\ninformation structures are investigated. In the first, all agents observe their\nlocal state and the mean-field of all sub-populations, in the second, all\nagents observe their local state but the mean-field of only a subset of the\nsub-populations. Both information structures are non-classical and not\npartially nested. Nonetheless, it is shown that linear control strategies are\noptimal for the first and approximately optimal for the second, the\napproximation error is inversely proportional to the size of the\nsub-populations whose mean-fields are not observed. The corresponding gains are\ndetermined by the solution of K+1 decoupled standard Riccati equations, where K\nis the number of sub-populations. The dimensions of the Riccati equations do\nnot depend on the size of the sub-populations, thus the solution complexity is\nindependent of the number of agents.

This setting offers the opportunity of improving the system\nperformance by employing multiple channel uses to convey a single message\n(output plant observation or control input).

It was originally\nthought that managed lanes would improve the use of existing infrastructure\nthrough incentivization of demand-management behaviors like carpooling, but\nimplementations have often been characterized by unpredicted phenomena that is\noften to detrimental system performance.\n  This paper presents several macroscopic traffic modeling tools we have used\nfor study of freeways equipped with managed lanes, or \"managed lane-freeway\nnetworks.\" The proposed framework is based on the widely-used first-order\nkinematic wave theory. In this model, the GP and the managed lanes are modeled\nas parallel links connected by nodes, where certain type of traffic may switch\nbetween GP and managed lane links. Two types of managed lane topologies are\nconsidered: full-access, where vehicles can switch between the GP and the\nmanaged lanes anywhere; and separated, where such switching is allowed only at\ncertain locations called gates.\n  We also describe methods to incorporate in three phenomena into our model\nthat are particular to managed lane-freeway networks. The inertia effect\nreflects drivers' inclination to stay in their lane as long as possible and\nswitch only if this would obviously improve their travel condition. The\nfriction effect reflects the empirically-observed driver fear of moving fast in\na managed lane while traffic in the adjacent GP lanes moves slowly due to\ncongestion. The smoothing effect describes how managed lanes can increase\nthroughput at bottlenecks by reducing lane changes.

Although mathematical models\ndescribing the endocrine system as a whole are still elusive, recently some\nsubstantial progress has been made in analyzing theoretically its subsystems\n(or axes) that regulate production of specific hormones. Many of the relevant\nmathematical models are similar in structure to (or squarely based on) the\ncelebrated Goodwin's oscillator. Such models are convenient to explain stable\nperiodic oscillations at hormones' level by representing the corresponding\nendocrine regulation circuits as cyclic feedback systems. However, many real\nhormonal regulation mechanisms (in particular, testosterone regulation) are in\nfact known to have non-cyclic structures and involve multiple feedbacks; a\nGoodwin-type model thus represents only a part of such a complicated mechanism.\nIn this paper, we examine a new mathematical model of hormonal regulation,\nobtained from the classical Goodwin's oscillator by introducing an additional\nnegative feedback. Local stability properties of the proposed model are\nstudied, and we show that the local instability of its unique equilibrium\nimplies oscillatory behavior of almost all solutions. Furthermore, under\nadditional restrictions we prove that almost all solutions converge to periodic\nones.\n",

Traditionally,\ntwo ways of handling the problem are used. The first class of methods employs a\ndistance measure on time series (e.g. Euclidean, Dynamic Time Warping) and a\nclustering technique (e.g. k-means, k-medoids, hierarchical clustering) to find\nnatural groups in the dataset. It is, however, often not clear whether these\ndistance measures effectively take into account the specific temporal\ncorrelations in these time series. The second class of methods uses the\ninput/output data to identify a dynamic system using an identification scheme,\nand then applies a model norm-based distance (e.g. H2, H-infinity) to find out\nwhich systems are similar. This, however, can be very time consuming for large\namounts of long time series data.

Our results are based on a combination of monotone systems\ntheory and spectral operator theory. We exploit the framework of the Koopman\noperator, which provides a linear infinite-dimensional description of nonlinear\ndynamical systems and spectral operator-theoretic notions such as eigenvalues\nand eigenfunctions. The sublevel sets of the dominant eigenfunction form a\nfamily of nested forward-invariant sets and the basin of attraction is the\nlargest of these sets. The boundaries of these sets, called isostables, allow\nstudying temporal properties of the system. Our first observation is that the\ndominant eigenfunction is increasing in every variable in the case of monotone\nsystems. This is a strong geometric property which simplifies the computation\nof isostables. We also show how variations in basins of attraction can be\nbounded under parametric uncertainty in the vector field of monotone systems.\nFinally, we study the properties of the parameter set for which a monotone\nsystem is multistable. Our results are illustrated on several systems of two to\nfour dimensions.\n",

The proposed method gives birth to an ultimate attitude algorithm\nscheme that can be naturally extended to the general rigid motion computation.\nIt is extensively evaluated under the attitude coning motion and compares\nfavorably in accuracy with the mainstream attitude algorithms.

Our goal is to design\na coding scheme at the sensor, which encodes the state information, in order to\nimpair the eavesdropper's estimation performance, while enabling the user to\nsuccessfully decode the sent messages. We introduce a novel class of codes,\ntermed State-Secrecy Codes, which use acknowledgment signals from the user and\napply linear time-varying transformations to the current and previously\nreceived states. By exploiting the properties of the system's process noise,\nthe channel physical model and the dynamics, these codes manage to be fast,\nefficient and, thus, suitable for real-time dynamical systems. We prove that\nunder minimal conditions, State-Secrecy Codes achieve perfect secrecy, namely\nthe eavesdropper's estimation error grows unbounded almost surely, while the\nuser's estimation performance is optimal. These conditions only require that at\nleast once, the user receives the corresponding packet while the eavesdropper\nfails to intercept it. Even one occurrence of this event renders the\neavesdropper's error unbounded with asymptotically optimal rate of increase.\nState-Secrecy Codes are provided and studied for two cases, i) when direct\nstate measurements are available, and ii) when we only have output\nmeasurements.

We present verifiable sufficient\nconditions under which AVI is stable (almost surely bounded) and converges to a\nfixed point of the approximate Bellman operator. To ensure the stability of\nAVI, we present three different yet related sets of sufficient conditions that\nare based on the existence of an appropriate Lyapunov function.

We address this concern by designing and\ndeveloping a distributed, multi-modal anomaly detection approach that can sense\nthe health of the device and the electric power grid from the edge. This is\nrealized by exploiting unsupervised machine learning algorithms on multiple\nsources of time-series data, fusing these multiple local observations and\nflagging anomalies when a deviation from the normal behavior is observed.\n  We particularly focus on the cyber-physical threats to the distributed PVs\nthat has the potential to cause local disturbances or grid instabilities by\ncreating supply-demand mismatch, reverse power flow conditions etc. We use an\nopen source power system simulation tool called GridLAB-D, loaded with real\nsmart home and solar datasets to simulate the smart grid scenarios and to\nillustrate the impact of PV attacks on the power system. Various attacks\ntargeting PV panels that create voltage fluctuations, reverse power flow etc\nwere designed and performed.

To address this problem, we\npropose an event-triggered diffusion Kalman filter, which collects measurements\nand exchanges messages between nodes based on a local signal indicating the\nestimation error. On this basis, we develop an energy-aware state estimation\nalgorithm that regulates the resource consumption in wireless networks and\nensures the effectiveness of every consumed resource. The proposed algorithm\ndoes not require the nodes to share its local covariance matrices, and thereby\nallows considerably reducing the number of transmission messages. To confirm\nits efficiency, we apply the proposed algorithm to the distributed simultaneous\nlocalization and time synchronization problem and evaluate it on a physical\ntestbed of a mobile quadrotor node and stationary custom ultra-wideband\nwireless devices. The obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed\nalgorithm allows saving 86% of the communication overhead associated with the\noriginal diffusion Kalman filter while causing deterioration of performance by\n16% only.

However, a direct application of HJ reachability\nto multi-vehicle trajectory planning is often intractable due to the \"curse of\ndimensionality.\" To overcome this problem, the sequential trajectory planning\n(STP) method, which assigns strict priorities to vehicles, was proposed, STP\nallows multi-vehicle trajectory planning to be done with a linearly-scaling\ncomputation complexity. However, if a vehicle not in the set of STP vehicles\nenters the system, or even worse, if this vehicle is an adversarial intruder,\nthe previous formulation requires the entire system to perform replanning, an\nintractable task for large-scale systems.

We consider finite horizon optimal control to steer the network\nfrom an arbitrary initial state, defined in terms of active link set and\nsupply-demand at the nodes, to a feasible state, i.e., a state which is\ninvariant under the failure rule. There is no running cost and the reward\nassociated with a feasible terminal state is the associated cumulative\nsupply-demand. We propose two approaches for computing optimal control.

Motivated by inference of\nspatio-temporal dynamics in breast cancer research, we propose a method to\nefficiently solve an identification problem for a specific class of\ndiscrete-time LTV systems, in which the states are fully observed and there is\nno access to system inputs. In addition, it is assumed that we do not know on\nwhich states the inputs act, which can change between time steps, and that the\ntotal number of inputs is sparse over all states and over time. The problem is\nformulated as a compressive sensing problem, which incorporates the effect of\nmeasurement noise and which has a solution with a partially sparse support. We\nderive sufficient conditions for the unique recovery of the system model and\ninput values, which lead to practical conditions on the number of experiments\nand rank conditions on system outputs. Synthetic experiments analyze the\nmethod's sensitivity to noise for randomly generated models.\n",

Hence, feedback\nafter each decision event is the cumulative effect of the following state\ntransition events.

The proposed methodology is\ncompletely generalizable, and does not require an offline step or human domain\nknowledge to build a model for the hot water vessel or the heating element.\nOccupant preferences too are learnt on the fly. The proposed system is applied\nto a set of 32 houses in the Netherlands where it reduces energy consumption\nfor hot water production by roughly 20% with no loss of occupant comfort.\nExtrapolating, this translates to absolute savings of roughly 200 kWh for a\nsingle household on an annual basis. This performance can be replicated to any\ndomestic hot water system and optimization objective, given that the fairly\nminimal requirements on sensor data are met. With millions of hot water systems\noperational worldwide, the proposed framework has the potential to reduce\nenergy consumption in existing and new systems on a multi Gigawatt-hour scale\nin the years to come.\n",

First,\nthe notion of observability attacks is defined based on a proposed\ngraph-theoretic construct. In this respect, a structured approach is proposed\nto characterize critical sets, whose removal renders the system unobservable.\nIt is then shown that, for the system to be observable, these critical sets\nmust be part of a maximum matching over a proposed bipartite graph. In\naddition, it is shown that stealthy data injection attacks (SDIAs) constitute a\nspecial case of these observability attacks. Then, various attack strategies\nand defense policies, for observability and data injection attacks, are shown\nto be amenable to analysis using the introduced graph-theoretic framework. The\nproposed framework is then shown to provide a unified basis for analysis of\nfour key security problems (among others), pertaining to the characterization\nof: 1) The sparsest SDIA; 2) the sparsest SDIA including a certain measurement;\n3) a set of measurements which must be defended to thwart all potential SDIAs;\nand 4) the set of measurements, which when protected, can thwart any SDIA whose\ncardinality is below a certain threshold.

Previously, similar attempts have been made\nfor pole placement in delay-free systems. The presence of the time delay term\nmanifests itself as a higher order system with variable number of interlaced\npoles and zeros upon Pade approximation, which makes it difficult to achieve\nprecise pole placement control. We here report the analytical expressions to\nconstrain the closed loop dominant and non-dominant poles at the desired\nlocations in the complex s-plane, using a third order Pade approximation for\nthe delay term. However, invariance of the closed loop performance with\ndifferent time delay approximation has also been verified using increasing\norder of Pade, representing a closed to reality higher order delay dynamics.\nThe choice of the nature of non-dominant poles e.g. all being complex, real or\na combination of them modifies the characteristic equation and influences the\nachievable stability regions. The effect of different types of non-dominant\npoles and the corresponding stability regions are obtained for nine test-bench\nprocesses indicating different levels of open-loop damping and lag to delay\nratio. Next, we investigate which expression yields a wider stability region in\nthe design parameter space by using Monte Carlo simulations while uniformly\nsampling a chosen design parameter space. Various time and frequency domain\ncontrol performance parameters are investigated next, as well as their\ndeviations with uncertain process parameters, using thousands of Monte Carlo\nsimulations, around the robust stable solution for each of the nine test-bench\nprocesses.\n",

However, controllability can be too\nstrict a condition, failing to capture a range of desirable behaviors.\nHerdability, which describes the ability to drive a system to a specific set in\nthe state space, was recently introduced as an alternative network control\nnotion. This paper considers the application of herdability to the study of\ncomplex networks under the assumption that a positive system evolves on the\nnetwork. The herdability of a class of networked systems is investigated and\ntwo problems related to ensuring system herdability are explored. The first is\nthe input addition problem, which investigates which nodes in a network should\nreceive inputs to ensure that the system is herdable. The second is a related\nproblem of selecting the best single node from which to herd the network, in\nthe case that a single node is guaranteed to make the system is herdable. In\norder to select the best herding node, a novel control energy based herdability\ncentrality measure is introduced.\n",

In this paper, a model-free Active Input-Output\nFeedback Linearization (AIOFL) technique based on an Improved Active\nDisturbance Rejection Control (IADRC) paradigm is proposed to design feedback\nlinearization control law for a generalized nonlinear system with known\nrelative degree. The Linearization Control Law(LCL) is composed of a scaled\ngeneralized disturbance estimated by an Improved Nonlinear Extended State\nObserver (INLESO) with saturation-like behavior and the nominal control law\nproduced by an Improved Nonlinear State Error Feedback (INLSEF). The proposed\nAIOFL cancels in real-time fashion the generalized disturbances which represent\nall the unwanted dynamics, exogenous disturbances, and system uncertainties and\ntransforms the system into a chain of integrators up to the relative degree of\nthe system, the only information required about the nonlinear system. Stability\nanalysis has been conducted based on Lyapunov functions and revealed the\nconvergence of the INLESO and the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop\nsystem. Verification of the outcomes has been achieved by applying the proposed\nAIOFL technique on the Flexible Joint Single Link Manipulator (SLFJM).

In the nested LESO, the\ninner-loop LESO actively estimates and eliminates the generalized disturbance.\nIncreasing the bandwidth improves the estimation accuracy which may tolerate\nnoise and conflict with H/W limitations and the sampling frequency of the\nsystem. Therefore, an alternative scenario is offered without increasing the\nbandwidth of the inner-loop LESO provided that the rate of change of the\ngeneralized disturbance estimation error is upper bounded. This is achieved by\nthe placing an outer-loop LESO in parallel with the inner one, it estimates and\neliminates the remaining generalized disturbance that eluded from the\ninner-loop LESO due to bandwidth limitations. The stability of LESO and nested\nLESO is investigated using Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulations on\nuncertain nonlinear SISO system with time-varying exogenous disturbance\nrevealed that the proposed nested LESO can successfully deal with a generalized\ndisturbance in both noisy and noise-free environments, where the Integral Time\nAbsolute Error (ITAE) of the tracking error for the nested LESO is reduced by\n69.87% from that of the LESO.\n",

Such dependence on sensors and communication links\nexposes AVs to cyber-physical (CP) attacks by adversaries that seek to take\ncontrol of the AVs by manipulating their data. Thus, to ensure safe and optimal\nAV dynamics control, the data processing functions at AVs must be robust to\nsuch CP attacks. To this end, in this paper, the state estimation process for\nmonitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel\nadversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize\nthe robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and\nthe AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In\nthe formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor\nreadings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and\npotentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the\nroads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the\ndeviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions.\nSince the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the\ninfinite possibilities for data value manipulations, the outcome of the\nplayers' past interactions are fed to long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks.\nEach player's LSTM block learns the expected spacing deviation resulting from\nits own action and feeds it to its RL algorithm. Then, the the attacker's RL\nalgorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the\nAV's RL algorithm tries to find the optimal action that minimizes such\ndeviation.\n",

The fundamental idea is\nto integrate both mechanistic models, which describe dynamics in soil moisture\nvariations, and data-driven models, which characterize uncertainty in forecast\nerrors of evapotranspiration and precipitation, into a holistic systems control\nframework. To better capture the support of uncertainty distribution, we take a\nnew learning-based approach by constructing uncertainty sets from historical\ndata. For evapotranspiration forecast error, the support vector\nclustering-based uncertainty set is adopted, which can be conveniently built\nfrom historical data. As for precipitation forecast errors, we analyze the\ndependence of their distribution on forecast values, and further design a\ntailored uncertainty set based on the properties of this type of uncertainty.\nIn this way, the overall uncertainty distribution can be elaborately described,\nwhich finally contributes to rational and efficient control decisions. To\nassure the quality of data-driven uncertainty sets, a training-calibration\nscheme is used to provide theoretical performance guarantees. A generalized\naffine decision rule is adopted to obtain tractable approximations of optimal\ncontrol problems, thereby ensuring the practicability of DDRMPC. Case studies\nusing real data show that, DDRMPC can reliably maintain soil moisture above the\nsafety level and avoid crop devastation. The proposed DDRMPC approach leads to\na 40% reduction of total water consumption compared to the fine-tuned open-loop\ncontrol strategy. In comparison with the carefully tuned rule-based control and\ncertainty equivalent model predictive control, the proposed DDRMPC approach can\nsignificantly reduce the total water consumption and improve the control\nperformance.\n",

We introduce and\nanalyze a framework to operate a community microgrid, and to share the\nresulting revenues and costs among its members. A market-oriented pricing of\nenergy exchanges within the community is obtained by implementing an internal\nlocal market based on the marginal pricing scheme. The market aims at\nmaximizing the social welfare of the community, thanks to the more efficient\nallocation of resources, the reduction of the peak power to be paid, and the\nincreased amount of reserve, achieved at an aggregate level. A community\nmicrogrid operator, acting as a benevolent planner, redistributes revenues and\ncosts among the members, in such a way that the solution achieved by each\nmember within the community is not worse than the solution it would achieve by\nacting individually. In this way, each member is incentivized to participate in\nthe community on a voluntary basis. The overall framework is formulated in the\nform of a bilevel model, where the lower level problem clears the market, while\nthe upper level problem plays the role of the community microgrid operator.\nNumerical results obtained on a real test case implemented in Belgium show\naround 54% cost savings on a yearly scale for the community, as compared to the\ncase when its members act individually.\n",

We describe a smart solar inverter system with battery which can either\noperate in an automatic mode or receive commands over a network to charge and\ndischarge at a given rate. In order to make battery storage financially viable\nand advantageous to the consumers, effective battery scheduling algorithms can\nbe employed. Particularly, when time-of-use tariffs are in effect in the region\nof the inverter, it is possible in some cases to schedule the battery to save\nmoney for the individual customer, compared to the \"automatic\" mode. Hence,\nthis paper presents and evaluates the performance of a novel battery scheduling\nalgorithm for residential consumers of solar energy. The proposed battery\nscheduling algorithm optimizes the cost of electricity over next 24 hours for\nresidential consumers. The cost minimization is realized by controlling the\ncharging/discharging of battery storage system based on the predictions for\nload and solar power generation values. The scheduling problem is formulated as\na linear programming problem. We performed computer simulations over 83\ninverters using several months of hourly load and PV data. The simulation\nresults indicate that key factors affecting the viability of optimization are\nthe tariffs and the PV to Load ratio at each inverter. Depending on the tariff,\nsavings of between 1% and 10% can be expected over the automatic approach. The\nprediction approach used in this paper is also shown to out-perform basic\n\"persistence\" forecasting approaches. We have also examined the approaches for\nimproving the prediction accuracy and optimization effectiveness.\n",

The sampler design\nproblem is studied to optimize these data freshness metrics, even when there is\na sampling rate constraint. This sampling problem is formulated as a\nconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) with a possibly uncountable state\nspace. We present a complete characterization of the optimal solution to this\nMDP: The optimal sampling policy is a deterministic or randomized threshold\npolicy, where the threshold and the randomization probabilities are\ncharacterized based on the optimal objective value of the MDP and the sampling\nrate constraint. The optimal sampling policy can be computed by bisection\nsearch, and the curse of dimensionality is circumvented.

We deal with this problem\nfrom a different point of view as compared to most recent literature. Indeed,\ninstead of considering controllability in the Kalman sense, that is, as the\nability to drive the target states to a desired value, we consider the stronger\nrequirement of driving the target variables as time functions. The latter\nnotion is called functional target controllability. We think that restricting\nthe controllability requirement to a limited set of important variables\njustifies using a more accurate notion of controllability for these variables.\nRemarkably, the notion of functional controllability allows formulating very\nsimple graphical conditions for target controllability in the spirit of the\nstructural approach to controllability. The functional approach enables us,\nmoreover, to determine the smallest set of steering nodes that need to be\nactuated to ensure target controllability, where these steering nodes are\nconstrained to belong to a given set. We show that such a smallest set can be\nfound in polynomial time.

The control of such a system is implemented by imposing a limit on the\nnumber of jobs that can share the server concurrently, with the rest of the\njobs waiting in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer. A desirable control scheme\nshould strike the right balance between efficiency (operating at a high service\nrate) and parallelism (preventing small jobs from getting stuck behind large\nones).\n  We employ the framework of heavy-traffic diffusion analysis to devise near\noptimal control heuristics for such a queueing system. However, while the\nliterature on diffusion control of state-dependent queueing systems begins with\na sequence of systems and an exogenously defined drift function, we begin with\na finite discrete PS server and propose an axiomatic recipe to explicitly\nconstruct a sequence of state-dependent PS servers which then yields a drift\nfunction. We establish diffusion approximations and use them to obtain\ninsightful and closed-form approximations for the original system under a\nstatic concurrency limit control policy.\n  We extend our study to control policies that dynamically adjust the\nconcurrency limit. We provide two novel numerical algorithms to solve the\nassociated diffusion control problem. Our algorithms can be viewed as \"average\ncost\" iteration: The first algorithm uses binary-search on the average cost and\ncan find an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy in time $O\\left( \\log^2\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right)$; the second algorithm uses the Newton-Raphson\nmethod for root-finding and requires $O\\left( \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\log\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ time.\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation for\nchoosing optimal or near-optimal static and dynamic concurrency control\nheuristics.\n",

Our\nintuitive, two-phases cross-correlation based scheme relies on a switched beam\nantenna array, which is used to collect an omni-directional signal using few\nelements of the antenna array in the first phase. In the second phase, the\nscheme switches the main beam of the antenna array to scan the angular region\nof interest. The collected signal from each beam (direction or angle) is cross\ncorrelated with the omni-directional signal. The cross-correlation coefficient\nwill be the highest at the correct AoA and relatively negligible elsewhere. The\nproposed scheme simplicity stems from its low computational complexity (only\ncross-correlation and comparison operations are required) and its independence\nof the transmitted signal structure (does not require information about the\ntransmitted signal). The proposed scheme requires a receiver with switched beam\nantenna array, which can be attached to a single radio frequency chain through\nphase shifters, hence, its hardware friendliness. The high efficiency of our\nsystem can be observed by comparing its performance with the literature's best\nperforming MUSIC algorithm. The comparison demonstrates that our scheme\noutperforms the MUSIC algorithm, specially at low SNR levels. Moreover, the\nnumber of sources that can be detected using our scheme is bound by the number\nof switched beams, rather than the number of antenna elements in the case of\nthe MUSIC algorithm.\n",

This allows to account for different properties of the\nestimated impulse response (e.g. smoothness and stability) while also\npenalizing high-complexity models.

The shape of\nthe optimal control signal is studied for different model parameters and\nspreading rate profiles.

This allowed us to derive and analyze spectrum of the\nnon-equilibrium (detailed balance broken) statistical system and uncover how\nswitching policy affects oscillatory trend and speed of the relaxation.\nRelaxation of the ensemble is of a practical interest because it describes how\nthe ensemble recovers from significant perturbations, e.g. forceful temporary\nswitching off aimed at utilizing flexibility of the ensemble in providing\n\"demand response\" services relieving consumption temporarily to balance larger\npower grid. We discuss how the statistical analysis can guide further\ndevelopment of the emerging demand response technology.\n",

Specifically we utilize and develop the\nclass of MDP models previously coined linearly solvable MDPs, that describe\noptimal dynamics of the probability distribution of an ensemble of many cycling\ndevices. Two principally different settings are discussed. First, we consider\noptimal strategy of the ensemble aggregator balancing between minimization of\nthe cost of operations and minimization of the ensemble welfare penalty, where\nthe latter is represented as a KL-divergence between actual and normal\nprobability distributions of the ensemble. Then, second, we shift to the demand\nresponse setting modeling the aggregator's task to minimize the welfare penalty\nunder the condition that the aggregated consumption matches the targeted\ntime-varying consumption requested by the system operator. We discuss a\nmodification of both settings aimed at encouraging or constraining the\ntransitions between different states. The dynamic programming feature of the\nresulting modified MDPs is always preserved; however, `linear solvability' is\nlost fully or partially, depending on the type of modification. We also\nconducted some (limited in scope) numerical experimentation using the\nformulations of the first setting. We conclude by discussing future\ngeneralizations and applications.\n",

Series elastic actuators (SEAs) are a popular way to reduce the output\nimpedance of a robotic arm to improve control authority over the force exerted\non the environment. However this increased control over forces with lower\nimpedance comes at the cost of lower positioning precision and bandwidth. This\narticle examines the use of an iteratively-learned feedforward command to\nimprove position tracking when using SEAs. Over each iteration, the output\nresponses of the system to the quantized inputs are used to estimate a\nlinearized local system models.

        "summary": "  The Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP) is a nonholonomic, underactuated\nmechanical system, and has been popularized commercially as the {\\it Segway}.\nDesigning optimal control laws for point-to-point state-transfer for this\nautonomous mechanical system, while respecting momentum and torque constraints\nas well as the underlying manifold, continues to pose challenging problems. In\nthis article we present a successful effort in this direction: We employ\ngeometric mechanics to obtain a discrete-time model of the system, followed by\nthe synthesis of an energy-optimal control based on a discrete-time maximum\nprinciple applicable to mechanical systems whose configuration manifold is a\nLie group. Moreover, we incorporate state and momentum constraints into the\ndiscrete-time control directly at the synthesis stage. The control is\nimplemented on a WIP with parameters obtained from an existing prototype; the\nresults are highly encouraging, as demonstrated by numerical experiments.\n",
