Lukasiewicz Algebraic Logic models of genetic networks\nand signaling pathways in cells are formulated in terms of nonlinear dynamic\nsystems with n-state components that allow for the generalization of previous,\nBoolean or \"fuzzy\", logic models of genetic activities in vivo. Such models are\nthen applied to cell transformations during carcinogenesis based on very\nextensive genomic transcription and translation data from the CGAP databases\nsupported by NCI. Such models are represented in a Lukasiewicz-Topos with an\nn-valued Lukasiewicz Algebraic Logics subobject classifier description that\nrepresents non-random and nonlinear network activities as well as their\ntransformations in carcinogeness. Specific models for different types of cancer\nare then derived from representations of the dynamic state-space of LT\nnon-random, pseudo-Markov chain process, network models in terms of cDNA and\nproteomic, high throughput analyses by ultra-sensitive techniques. This novel\ntheoretical analysis is based on extensive CGAP genomic data for human tumors,\nas well as recently published studies of cyclin signaling.

The model is fitted to data from the Ontario\n(Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions\nare made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current\neffect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for\nHong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto,\nOntario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between\nMarch 31st and April 6th, followed by a {\\it significant} slowing in the number\nof new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic\nrate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best\nestimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto,\nalthough the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model.\nIt is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission,\nSARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that\ncomputed for some strains of influenza \\cite{CC2}.

Our theory leads to\npredictions for sleep time, sleep cycle time, and REM (rapid-eye-movement) time\nas functions of body and brain mass, and explains, for example, why mice sleep\n\\~14 hours per day relative to the 3.5 hours per day that elephants sleep.

The essential ingredients of\nthe ISI Reading Unit (IRU) are (i) a tunable time delay circuit modelled after\none found in the anterior forebrain pathway of the birdsong system and (ii) a\nrecently observed rule for inhibitory synaptic plasticity. We present a circuit\nthat can both learn the ISIs of a training sequence using inhibitory synaptic\nplasticity and then recognize the same ISI sequence when it is presented on\nsubsequent occasions. We investigate the ability of this IRU to learn in the\npresence of two kinds of noise: jitter in the time of each spike and random\nspikes occurring in the ideal spike sequence. We also discuss how the circuit\ncan be detuned by removing the selected ISI sequence and replacing it by an ISI\nsequence with ISIs drawn from a probability distribution.\n  We have investigated realizations of the time delay circuit using\nHodgkin-Huxley conductance based neurons connected by realistic excitatory and\ninhibitory synapses. Our models for the time delay circuit are tunable from\nabout 10 ms to 100 ms allowing one to learn and recognize ISI sequences within\nthat range of ISIs.

Since this response is a typical index of opiate\nactivation, it has been proposed that the opioidergic systems of such mice are\nchronically activated. This activation appeared to be a potent factor, which\nleads to addiction to aggression. To check this hypothesis, we exposed the mice\nwho had won 20 fights in succession with conspecifics to a behavioral\nsensitization procedure. The effects of the mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine\n(10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the behavior of winners were examined in an open-field test\nbefore and after 5- and 14-day deprivation of aggression. Morphine had a much\nstronger stimulating effect on the open-field behavior of 60 % of the winners\ndeprived of aggression for 14 days than on that of the control mice. Morphine\ndid not stimulate behavioral activity in the winners before or after\ndeprivation for 5 days. The aggression level in the winners was higher after\nthan before deprivation. It has been concluded that, in the winners, the\nmu-opioid receptors became tolerant to the effects of morphine and became\nsensitized after long aggression deprivation. The development of addiction to\naggression due to repeated victories is discussed in the light of the theory of\naddiction (Robinson,Berridge, 2003).\n",

The\nintersection of septa with the external shell generates a curve called the\nsuture line, which in living and most fossil Nautili is fairly uncomplicated.\nIn contrast, suture lines of ancient ammonoid were gently curved and during the\nevolution of the group became highly complex, in some cases so extensively\nfrilled to be considerable as fractal curves. Numerous theories have been put\nforward to explain the complexity of suture ammonoid lines. Calculations\npresented here lend support to the hypothesis that complex suture lines aided\nin counteracting the effect of the external water pressure.

Glutathione is known to be the main agent\nresponsible for the excretion of mercury (we refer to \\cite{Thim05},\n\\cite{ZalBar99} and \\cite{Lyn02}). It has also been shown that mercury inhibits\nglutathione synthetase (an enzyme acting in the synthesization of Glutathione),\ntherefore leading to decreased glutathione levels\n  (we refer to \\cite{Thim05}, \\cite{GeGe05}, \\cite{GeGe06} and \\cite{RDeth04}).\nMercury also interferes with the production of heme in the porphyrin pathway\n\\cite{WoMaEc93}. Heme is needed for biological energy production and ability to\ndetox organic toxins via the P450 enzymes \\cite{Boy06}. The purpose of this\npaper is to show that body's response to mercury exposure is hysteretic, i.e.\nwhen this feedback of mercury on its main detoxifying agents is strong enough\nthen mercury body burden has two points of equilibrium: one with normal\nabilities to detoxify and low levels of mercury and one with inhibited\nabilities to detoxify and high levels of mercury. Furthermore, a small increase\nof body's mercury burden may not be sufficient to trigger observable neurotoxic\neffects but it may be sufficient to act as a switch leading to an accumulation\nof mercury in the body through environmental exposure until its toxicity\nbecomes manifest.\n",

Thereby, the harmonicity itself represents a specific\nunity and coherence of physico-chemical properties of amino acid molecules and\nthe number of atoms and/or nucleons in the molecules themselves (in the form of\ntypical balances). A specific Gauss' arithmetical algorithm has the central\nposition among all these structures and it corresponds to the patterns of the\nnumber of atoms within the side chains of amino acid molecules in the following\nsense: G+V = 11; P+I = 21; S+T+L+A+G = 31; D+E+M+C+P = 41; K+R+Q+N+V = 61;\nF+Y+W+H+I = 71; (L+M+Q+W) + (A+C+N+H) = 81; (S+D+K+F) + (T+E+R+Y) = 91;\n(F+L+M+S+P) = (T+A+Y+H+I) = (Q+N+K+D+V) = (E+C+W+R+G) = 51. Bearing in mind all\nthese regularities it make sense to talk about genetic code as a harmonic\nsystem. On the other hand, such an order provides new evidence supporting the\nhypothesis established in the previous paper (Rakocevic, 2004) that genetic\ncode has been complete from the very beginning and as such was the condition\nfor the origin and evolution of life.\n",

In both cases, the difference between this stress level and that of\nthe opposite side, in light tension, generates the bending of the axis.\nHowever, light values of compression were sometimes measured in the opposite\nside of angiosperms.

In many studies this behavioral activity is\nconsidered as sexual motivation, arising in this experimental context in male\nmice. The lack of correlation between behavioral parameters and gonad reaction\nof males on receptive female, uninterconnected changes of these two parameters\nas well as the lack of sexual behavior between naive male and female when\npartition is removed cast doubt on this data interpretation.

Short-term\nincrease of the level of testosterone (possessing rewarding properties) is\ninnate stimulus-response reaction which stimulates and prolongs behavioral\ninterest of male to receptive female.

        "summary": "  Constraint-based modeling has been widely used on metabolic networks\nanalysis, such as biosynthetic prediction and flux optimization. The linear\nconstraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However,\nrecently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known\nas \"loop law\", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be\nunfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been\nsuccessfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo\nsampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced\nto optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of\nHelicobacter pylori (iIT341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including\nreversibility and \"loop law\". The sampling method has also been employed to\noptimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is\nunified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a\nsample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based\non solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been\nproposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow\ncould be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to\nthe biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the\nsampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the\nresults have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the\npathways related to Biomass synthesis.\n",

However, their reactions with poorly liganded iron species can\nlead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl\nradical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic\ninflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the\ninvolvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a\nlarge number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and\ninflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation\nof cellular and organismal performance.

The\nemergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing\npresence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and\nveterinary infrastructures and human health. Furthermore, worldwide attention\nshould be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV. We propose a\nnew compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential\nequations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter\ndriven as a function of contact networks. The model is based on weighted\ncontact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions\nand the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for\neach set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among\nregions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not\nonly treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated\ninto the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data\nfrom the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the\nepidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive\nset of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for\naccurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the\nworld. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model\ndifferentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different\nprovinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the\noutbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction\nnumber is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction\nnumber are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.\n",

Though\nthere is no record of public or private stocking, channel catfish appeared in\nLake Diane between 1984 and 1995 and it has developed into an excellent\nfishery. Results: NLLS regression yields parameter estimates of b = 3.2293 and\na = 0.00522. The improved model yields the same estimate for the exponent, b,\nand a length estimate (parameter L1) of 45.23 cm. Estimates of uncertainty and\ncovariance are smaller for the improved model, but the correlation coefficient\nis r = 0.995 in both cases. LLS regression produced different parameter values,\na = 0.01356 and b = 2.9726, and a smaller correlation coefficient, r = 0.980.\nOn average, catfish in the sample weighed 106.0% of the standard weight, (Brown\net al.) and the linear regression (no slope) of fillet yield vs. total weight\nsuggests a typical fillet yield of 28.1% with r = 0.989. Conclusion: Most of\nthe fish in the sample were above the standard weight, heavier than the 75th\npercentile for their length. Channel catfish are doing well in Lake Diane and\nthe population is well matched to the food supply. Management should attempt to\nmaintain current population levels. In this case, the improved length-weight\nmodel, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, provided lower uncertainties in parameter estimates and\nsmaller covariance than the traditional model.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper presents, for the first time, four diversity types of protein\namino acids. The first type includes two amino acids (G, P), both without\nstandard hydrocarbon side chains; the second one four amino acids, as two pairs\n[(A, L), (V, I)], all with standard hydrocarbon side chains; the third type\ncomprises the six amino acids, as three pairs [(F, Y), (H, W), (C, M)], two\naromatic, two hetero aromatic and two \"hetero\" non-aromatic); finally, the\nfourth type consists of eight amino acids, as four pairs [(S, T), (D, E), (N,\nQ), (K, R)], all with a functional group which also exists in amino acid\nfunctional group (wholly presented: H2N-\\.CH-COOH; separately: OH, COOH, CONH2,\nNH2). The insight into existence of four types of diversity was possible only\nafter an insight into the existence of some very new arithmetical regularities,\nwhich were so far unknown. Also, as for showing these four types was necessary\nto reveal the relationships between several key harmonic structures of the\ngenetic code (which we presented in our previous works), this paper is also a\nreview article of the author's researches of the genetic code. By this, the\nreview itself shows that the said harmonic structures are connected through the\nsame (or near the same) chemically determined amino acid pairs, 10 pairs out of\nthe 190 possible.\n",

Currently,\nthere is insufficient scientific data, which represents the arrangement of\namino acid in the proteins based on atomic composition. Our deep observational\nand analytical studies indicate that the distribution of carbon in the protein\nsequence can bring differences in the function of proteins. Until now, it is\nbelieved that carbon content elicits the hydrophobic interactions in proteins.\nThis distinct feature classifies normal proteins and viral proteins based on\nthe carbon content. One of the objectives of this investigation is to show the\nsignificance of carbon composition in protein structure evaluation. Since, the\nlevel of perceived benefit is likely to be high in the field of proteomics for\nstructural analysis, the position of this paper is to prioritize only the avian\nviral protein sequences based on carbon content when compared with the normal\nprotein sequences. Here, we present the evaluation of carbon along the avian\nprotein sequence in order to show the differences in the distribution of carbon\nusing the software technology. The evaluation results provide a deep view in to\nthe molecular structure of avian viral protein, which can further enable the\nprogress of research in the proteomics domain based on carbon classification.\nThis systematic approach in computing carbon level of avian viruses aim towards\nthe benefit of individual, regional and global health in addition to opening of\nfurther effective research on avian viral protein based on the aforementioned\nresults\n",

The goal is\nto develop a hydrogen bonding magnetic reaction-based gene regulation (HBMR-GR)\nsystem. The polarities of DNA base pairs are derived from the relative\nelectrostatic charge between purines and pyrimidines, which become positively\nand negatively charged, respectively. The Pyu dsDNAs with\npyrimidine(s)-purine(s) sequences, ds3T3A, ds3C3G, and ds3C3A, showed stronger\nDNA hybridization potential, increased infrared absorption at 3400-3200 cm-1,\nand a unique DNA conformation in HPLC analysis compared to the corresponding\nPuy dsDNAs. To target the three-dimensional structure of dsDNA based on the DNA\nbase pair polarities, one can use cyclic electromagnetic DNA simulation (CEDS)\nwith approximately 25% efficiency for randomly oriented dsDNAs. CEDS was found\nto induce sequence-specific hybridization of target oligo-dsDNAs in 0.005M NaCl\nsolution and sequence-specific conformation of oligo-dsDNAs in 0.1M NaCl\nsolution. It was found that the Pyu oligo-dsDNAs were more responsible for the\nhybridization and conformational changes by CEDS than the Puy oligo-dsDNAs.\nCEDS decreased ethidium bromide (EtBr) DNA intercalation and spermidine DNA\ncondensation depending on CEDS time in the binding assay. The results also\nincluded that the Pyu oligo-dsDNAs were more responsible for CEDS by forming\nstable and unique conformation of oligo-dsDNA than the Therefore, it is\npostulated that the low-level HBMR-based CEDS can enhance the hybridization\npotential of oligo-dsDNAs and subsequently lead to the unique DNA conformation\nrequired for the initiation of various DNA functions.\n",

        "summary": "  It has been repeatedly proposed to expand the scope for SETI, and one of the\nsuggested alternatives to radio is the biological media. Genomic DNA is already\nused on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity,\nbut stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible\nmapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying\nthe code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over\ncosmological timescales. Thus, it represents a reliable storage for an\nintelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic\nrequirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far\nfrom being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally\ncannot be ruled out. A statistically strong signal in the genetic code is then\na testable consequence of such scenario. Here we show that the terrestrial code\ndisplays a thorough precision orderliness matching the criteria to be\nconsidered an informational signal. Simple arrangements of the code reveal an\nensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of the same symbolic\nlanguage. Accurate and systematic, these underlying patterns appear as a\nproduct of precision logic and nontrivial computing rather than of stochastic\nprocesses. The patterns are profound to the extent that the code mapping itself\nis uniquely deduced from their algebraic representation. The signal displays\nreadily recognizable hallmarks of artificiality. Besides, extraction of the\nsignal involves logically straightforward but abstract operations, making the\npatterns essentially irreducible to any natural origin. Plausible way of\nembedding the signal into the code and possible interpretation of its content\nare discussed. Overall, while the code is nearly optimized biologically, its\nlimited capacity is used extremely efficiently to store non-biological\ninformation.\n",

Our aim was to study\nboth theoretically and experimentally its reaction-diffusion mechanism to find\nthe source of that selectivity. Methods ClO2 permeation measurements through\nprotein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to\nreaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and\nestimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the\nreaction-diffusion equation were derived. Additionally, as a preliminary test,\nthree patients with infected wounds were treated with a 300 ppm high purity\nClO2 solution and the healing process was documented. Results The rate law of\nthe reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to\nthe square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small\nones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a\nbacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, the\nfew minutes of contact time (owing to the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough\nto kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living\ntissues safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects. Pictures of\nsuccessful wound healings confirm these considerations. Various properties of\nClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly,\nbacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with\nbiological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Conclusion\nSelectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different\nbiochemistry, but on their different size. Preliminary clinical results\nencourage further research with this promising local antiseptic.\n",

Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells\nwhile limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among\ncells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of\nselective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the\nidea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and\nhealthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to\ndiscriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then\nhow the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular\nmarkers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs\nto tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to\ndiscriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We\nalso find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs,\nsuggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In\nagreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy\nwell. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and\npredicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the\nindividual drugs alone.

        "summary": "  The temporal aspect of a model of pupal dehydration is improved upon. The\nobserved dependence of pupal transpiration on time is attributed to an\nalternation between two, essential modes, for which the deposition of a thin,\npupal skin inside the puparium and its subsequent demise are thought to be\nresponsible. For each mode of transpiration, the results of the Bursell (1958)\ninvestigation into pupal dehydration are used as a rudimentary data set. These\ndata are generalised to all temperatures and humidities by invoking the\nproperty of multiplicative separability. The problem, then, is that as the\ntemperature varies with time, so does the metabolism and the developmental\nstages to which the model data pertain, must necessarily warp. The\npuparial-duration formula of Phelps and Burrows (1969) and Hargrove (2004) is\nexploited to facilitate a mapping between the constant-temperature time domain\nof the data and that of some, more general case at hand. The resulting,\nGlossina morsitans model is extrapolated to other species using their relative\nsurface areas, their relative protected and unprotected transpiration rates and\ntheir different fourth instar excretions (drawing, to a lesser extent, from the\ndata of Buxton and Lewis, 1934). In this way the problem of pupal dehydration\nis formulated as a series of integrals and the consequent survival can be\npredicted. The discovery of a distinct definition for hygrophilic species,\nwithin the formulation, prompts the investigation of the hypothetical effect of\na two-day heat wave on pupae. This leads to the conclusion that the\nclassification of species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely\ntrue only in so much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the\nhours shortly before eclosion.\n",

An allowance is, nonetheless, made for the outstanding\ntemperature-dependent data. The data are generalised to all humidities, levels\nof activity and, in theory, temperatures, by invoking the property of\nmultiplicative separability. In this way a formulation, which is a very simple,\nfirst order, ordinary differential equation, is devised. The model is extended\nto include a variety of Glossina species by resorting to their relative,\nresting water loss rates in dry air. The calculated, total water loss is\nconverted to the relevant humidity, at 24 $^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, that which\nproduced an equivalent water loss in the pupa, in order to exploit an adaption\nof an established survival relationship. The resulting computational model\ncalculates total, teneral water loss, consequent mortality and adult\nrecruitment. Surprisingly, the postulated race against time, to feed, applies\nmore to the mesophilic and xerophilic species, in that increasing order. So\nmuch so that it is reasonable to conclude that, should Glossina brevipalpis\nsurvive the pupal phase, it will almost certainly survive to locate a host,\nwithout there being any significant prospect of death from dehydration.

In order to prevent falls\nwhile walking, one should rely on relevant early indicators of impaired dynamic\nbalance.

Although\nnumerous findings attest the validity of LDS as a fall risk index, reliability\nresults are still sparse. The present study explores the intrasession and\nintersession repeatability of gait LDS using intraclass correlation\ncoefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Ninety-five healthy\nindividuals performed 5min. treadmill walking in two sessions separated by 9\ndays. Trunk acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer. Three time\nscales were used to estimate LDS: over 4 to 10 strides ({\\lambda}4-10), over\none stride ({\\lambda}1) and over one step ({\\lambda}0.5). The intrasession\nrepeatability was assessed from three repetitions of either 35 strides or 70\nstrides taken within the 5min tests. The intersession repeatability compared\nthe two sessions, which totalized 210 strides. The intrasession ICCs\n(70-strides estimates/35-strides estimates) were 0.52/0.18 for {\\lambda}4-10\nand 0.84/0.77 for {\\lambda}1 and {\\lambda}0.5. The intersession ICCs were\naround 0.60.

        "summary": "  Cancers are caused by the accumulation of genetic alterations. Since this\naccumulation takes time, the incidence of most cancers is thought to increase\nexponentially with age. However, careful measurements of the age-specific\nincidence shows that the specific incidence for many forms of cancer rises with\nage to a maximum, then decreases. This decrease in the age-specific incidence\nwith age is an anomaly. Understanding this anomaly should lead to a better\nunderstanding of how tumors develop and grow. Here I derive the shape of the\nage-specific incidence, showing that it should follow the shape of a Weibull\ndistribution. Measurements indicate that the age-specific incidence for colon\ncancer does indeed follow a Weibull distribution. This analysis leads to the\ninterpretation that for colon cancer two sub-populations exist in the general\npopulation: a susceptible population and an immune population. Colon tumors\nwill only occur in the susceptible population. This analysis is consistent with\nthe developmental origins of disease hypothesis and generalizable to many other\ncommon forms of cancer.\n",

By modeling each cell in eukaryotic organisms as a processor\nhaving a unique set of allowed states, represented by a specific DNA sequence,\nwe demonstrate a method by which gene expression can be regulated. As the\ntheory is developed, we suggest reasons for the complementary, quaternary\n(4-base) coding scheme used in most eukaryotes. A role for transposable\nelements is suggested, as is a role for the abundance of noncoding DNA, along\nwith a clearly-defined method by which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's)\nmay alter gene expression. The effect of various errors is considered. Finally,\na mechanism for inter-processor communication is proposed to explain cell-cell\nrecognition processes, which leads to an elucidation of a possible pathway by\nwhich nonmutagenic carcinogenic agents may act.\n",

Moreover, ADSCs were cultured\nin the same conditions but the inducer cells were placed once in the UV-filter\ntube and once in the quartz tube to see whether there is electromagnetic\ninteraction among cells. Inducer cells caused significant cell proliferation in\nadjacent row cells (p- value<0.01) in the fifth day.

        "summary": "  A model of genome evolution is proposed. Based on three assumptions the\nevolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. The general law on the direction\nof genome evolution is given. Both the deterministic classical equation and the\nstochastic quantum equation are proposed. It is proved that the classical\nequation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can\nbe used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The\nwave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced\nlogically. It is shown that the classical trajectory is a limiting case of the\ngeneral quantum evolution depicted in the coarse-grained time. The observed\nsmooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the\nclassical and quantum phases. The speciation event is explained by the quantum\ntransition in quantum phase. Fundamental constants of time dimension, the\nquantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for\ncharacterizing the genome evolution. The size of minimum genome is deduced from\nthe quantum uncertainty lower bound. The present work shows the quantum law may\nbe more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic\nphysics, but also in genome evolution.\n",

        "summary": "  One of the answers to the measurement problem in quantum theory is given by\nthe Copenhagen-Interpretation of quantum theory (i.e. orthodox quantum theory)\nin which the wave function collapse happens in (by) the mind of observer. In\nfact, at first, great scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner\n(initially) believed that the wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is\ncaused by the consciousness of observer. However, this issue has been stayed\nyet very controversial. In fact, there are many challenging discussions about\nthe survival of quantum effects in microscopic structures of the human brain,\nwhich is mainly because of quick decoherence of quantum states due to hot, wet\nand noisy environment of the brain that forbids long life coherence for brain\nprocessing. Nevertheless, there are also several arguments and evidences that\nemergence of large coherent states is feasible in the brain. In this paper, our\napproach is based on the latter in which macroscopic quantum states are\nprobable in the human brain. Here, we simulate the delayed luminescence of\nphotons in neurons with a Brassard-like teleportation circuit, i.e. equivalent\nto the transfer of quantum states of photons through the visual pathways from\nretina to the visual cortex. Indeed, our simulation considers both classical\nand quantum mechanical aspects of processing in neurons. As a result and based\non our simulation, it is possible for our brain to receive the exact quantum\nstates of photons in the visual cortex to be collapsed by our consciousness,\nwhich supports the Copenhagen-Interpretation of measurement problem in quantum\ntheory.\n",

To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general\nfeatures of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their\nchemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states.\nThus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct\ntrajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible\nsequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained,\nsometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the\norganism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And\nthis is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a different\nframework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the\nview of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid\noveroptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely\ncomplemented. An increase of specification of experimental procedures is the\nway for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system\nmay be evolving.

The law of mass action does not\nautomatically conserve current, as is clear from mathematics of a simple case,\nchosen to illustrate the issues. The law of mass action does not force a series\nof chemical reactions to have the same current flow everywhere. Interruption of\nfar-away current does not stop current everywhere in a series of chemical\nreactions, and so does not obey Maxwell equations. An additional constraint and\nequation is needed to enforce the global continuity of current flow. The\nadditional constraint is introduced in this paper in the special case that the\nchemical reaction describes spatial movement through narrow channels. In that\ncase, a fully consistent treatment is possible using a variety of models of\ncharge movement. The general case must be dealt with by variational methods\nthat enforce consistency of all the physical laws involved. Variational methods\nhave only recently been developed to ensure that charge flow is conserved\nglobally, along with mass, in dissipative systems like ions in solution or\nproteins. The Energy Variational Approach EnVarA should allow the development\nof more robust models of chemical, biochemical, and biological systems, making\npractical devices more easy to design and build. These difficulties arise away\nfrom equilibrium, when current flows, and the law of mass action is applied to\na non-equilibrium situation, different from the systems considered when the law\nwas originally derived. Non-equilibrium systems are important. Almost all of\nbiology occurs away from equilibrium. Almost all devices of our technology\nfunction away from equilibrium. I believe robust models and device designs in\nthe chemical world will not be possible until continuity of current is embedded\nin a generalization of the law of mass action using a consistent variational\nmodel of energy and dissipation.\n",

However for saving resources, a\nmore economic strategy should be to make a rapid death to the individuals who\nare over the reproduction age rather than to make them aging. Biological\ntheories are proposed to identify the causes and the biological processes of\naging. However, some theories including cell senescence/telomere theory,\ngene-controlling theory, and developmental theory, have unfortunately ignored\nthe influence of damage on aging. Free-radical theory suggests that free\nradicals by causing intrinsic damage are the main cause of aging. However, even\nif intracellular free radicals cause injuries, they could be only associated\nwith some but not all of the aging changes. Damage (fault)-accumulation theory\npredicts that faults as intrinsic damage can accumulate and lead to aging.\nHowever, in fact an unrepaired fault could not possibly remain in a living\norganism, since it can destroy the integrity of tissue structure and cause\nrapid failure of the organism. These traditional theories are all incomplete on\ninterpreting aging phenomena. Nevertheless, developmental theory and damage\n(fault)-accumulation theory are more useful, because they have recognized the\nimportance of damage and development process in aging. Some physical theories\nare useful, because they point out the common characteristics of aging changes,\nincluding loss of complexity, consequence of increase of entropy, and failure\nof information-transmission. An advanced theory, which can include all of these\nuseful ideas in traditional theories, is needed.\n",

For understanding this phenomenon, some\naging changes are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism proposed in\nMisrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of repair for\nsurvival of an organism in situations of severe injuries; however a Misrepair\nalters the structure of a tissue, a cell or a molecule, which are the\nsub-structures of an organism. II. Misrepair of a sub-structure also alters the\nspatial relationship of this sub-structure with its neighbor sub-structures.\nThus a Misrepair leads to increased damage-sensitivity and reduced\nrepair-efficiency of these sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a\ntendency to occur to the sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an\nold Misrepair has taken place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again\nthe damage-sensitivity of these sub-structures and the surrounding\nsub-structures. By such a vicious circle, the frequency of Misrepairs to these\nsub-structures is increased and the range of affected sub-structures is\nenlarged after each time of Misrepair. Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is\nfocalized and self-accelerating. III. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs\nleads to formation and growing of a \"spot\" or \"plaque\" in a tissue. Growing of\na spot is self-accelerating, and old spots grow faster than new ones. New spots\ntend to develop close to old ones, resulting in an inhomogeneous distribution\nof spots. In conclusion, the inhomogeneous development of aging changes is a\nresult of self-accelerated and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; and the\nprocess of aging is self-accelerating.\n",

A frequently advocated conservation objective is to maximise the\nretention of \"roadless space\", a concept that is based on distance to the\nnearest road from any point. We developed a novel use of the empty space\nfunction - a general statistical tool based on stochastic geometry and random\nsets theory - to calculate roadless space in a part of the Congo Basin where\nthere has recently been rapid expansion of road networks. We compared the\ntemporal development of roadless space in certified and non-certified logging\nconcessions inside and outside areas declared as IFL in the year 2000. Between\n1999 and 2007, rapid road network expansion led to a marked loss of roadless\nspace in IFL. After 2007, this trajectory levelled out in most areas, due to an\nequilibrium between newly built roads and abandoned roads that became\nrevegetated. However, concessions within IFL that have been certified by FSC\nsince around 2007 showed continued decreases in roadless space, thus reaching a\nlevel comparable to all other concessions.

In this\ncontext, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the\nset of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of\nsubsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by\nputting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D\nand L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,\nrespectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we\ndefine functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer\nquaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a\ngiven D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that\none corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for\nthe amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to\ndescribe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.\n",

        "summary": "  The corner stone of the classical model after Huxley and Simmons is\nsupposition that a myosin head can reside only in several discrete states and\nirregularly jumps from one state to another. Until now, it has not been found a\nway to experimentally verify this supposition although confirmation or\nrefutation of the existence of discrete states is crucial for the solution of\nmyosin motor problem. Here I show that a set of equal myosin heads arranged\nequidistantly along an actin filament produce X-ray pattern which varies with\nthe type of conformation. If the lever arms of all myosin heads reside in one\nand the same position (continuous conformation), all the heads have the same\nform-factor and equally scatter electromagnetic wave. In this case, only the\ngeometric factor associated with a spatial ordering of the heads will determine\nthe X-ray pattern. The situation changes if the average lever arm position is\nthe same, but inherently every head can reside only in several diverse discrete\nstates, hopping irregularly from one to another. In this case, the form-factors\ncorresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases\nof X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every\nquantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,\nthis results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern\nshould slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with\nthe continuous-type conformation. The formulas describing both cases are\ncompared in this article. In general, the distinction between X-ray patterns is\ninsignificant, but they could be appreciably different at some stages of\nconformation process (respective lever arm position depends on the type of\ndiscrete model). Consequently, one can with luck attempt to find out this\ndifference using a high-sensitive equipment.\n",

This variability in body dimensions (called\n\"anthropometry\") is involved in design tools commonly used today to assess\nuser's accommodation (physical mock-ups, population models, database, boundary\nmanikins, hybrid methods or digital human modeling). Databases are created from\ncampaigns of measurement. Besides the fact that such measures are costly in\ntime and money, they give more \"static\" measures of man. They do not take into\naccount possible stretching limbs that could allow increased accessibility.\nThis paper presents a methodology for human body modeling, in a dynamic way,\nnot static. The methodology allows to highlight influences of design and human\nbehaviour on reach skills, directly induced by the interaction with real\nprototypes and not just considered by human physical dimensions. The first part\nof the method is to create a database of measurements (arms length, hip\nbreadth, etc.). From these data, a model of accessibility is proposed. The\naccessibility field is determined purely numerically. In parallel, an\nexperiment is set up to measure the extension of the accessibility field, with\nthe same people.

The powdered sea\nshells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning\nElectron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly\nmicrospheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments\nwere conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into\nthe sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of\ndrug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in\ndrug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent\nultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro\ndrug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM\nimages displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The\nsea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be\nuseful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and\n39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)\nwas observed within two hours for both the drugs studied.

Free-ranging dogs\nlive in small social groups, mate promiscuously, and lack the cooperative\nbreeding biology of other group living canids. They face high early life\nmortality, which in turn reduces fitness benefits of the mother from a batch of\npups. We carried out a field based study on free-ranging dogs in India to\nunderstand the nature of parental care provided by mothers at different stages\nof pup development. Using behavioural patterns of mother-pup interactions, we\ndraw up a timeline of pup ontogeny.

        "summary": "  The present view of biological phenomena is based on a biochemical paradigm\nthat development of living organisms is defined by information stored in a\nmolecular form as some genetic code. However, new discoveries indicate that\nbiological phenomena cannot be confined to a biochemical realm alone, but are\nalso influenced by physical mechanisms. These mechanisms work at cellular,\norgan and whole organism spatial levels. They impose uniquely defined\nconstraints on distribution of nutrients between biomass synthesis and\nmaintenance of existing biomass, thus influencing the composition of\nbiochemical reactions, their successive change and irreversibility during the\norganismal life cycle. Mathematically, such a growth mechanism is represented\nby a growth equation. Using this equation, we introduce growth models, show\ntheir adequacy to experimental data, and discover two types of division\nmechanisms, examining growth of unicellular organisms Amoeba, S. pombe, E.\ncoli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus. Also, on the basis of the growth equation,\nwe find different metabolic characteristics of these organisms. For instance,\nit was shown that in logarithmic coordinates the values of their metabolic\nallometric exponents are located on a straight line. This fact has important\nimplications with regard to evolutionary process of organisms within a food\nchain, considered as a single system. High adequateness of obtained results to\nexperimental data, from different perspectives, as well as excellent compliance\nwith previously proven more particular knowledge, and with general criteria for\nvalidation of scientific truths, proves validity of the introduced general\ngrowth mechanism and the growth equation. Taken together, the obtained results\nset solid grounds for introduction of a more comprehensive physical-biochemical\nparadigm of Life origin, development and evolution.\n",

Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses\nusing 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected\ngermination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time\n(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that\ngermination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl\nconcentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance\nwas observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate\nsalt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be\nmore accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,\nremains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)\nand velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the\nhigh salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt\nenvironment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended\nfor plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when\nungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,\nthey recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high\nspeed. This indicated that the germination inhibition was related to a\nreversible osmotic stress that induced dormancy rather than specific ion\ntoxicity. Conclusion: This ability to germinate after exposure to higher\nconcentrations of NaCl suggests that studied species, especially the most\ntolerant could be able to germinate under the salt affected soils and could be\nutilized for the rehabilitation of damaged arid zones.\n",

This\nstudy proposes a method to overcome the saturation at high AGB values of\nexisting AGB map (Vieilledent's AGB map) by using a map of correction factors\ngenerated from GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) spaceborne LiDAR data.\nThe Vieilledent's AGB map of Madagascar was established using optical images,\nwith parameters calculated from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model, climatic\nvariables, and field inventories. In the present study, first, GLAS LiDAR data\nwere used to obtain a spatially distributed (GLAS footprints geolocation)\nestimation of AGB (GLAS AGB) covering Madagascar forested areas, with a density\nof 0.52 footprint/km 2. Second, the difference between the AGB from the\nVieilledent's AGB map and GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint location was\ncalculated, and additional spatially distributed correction factors were\nobtained. Third, an ordinary kriging interpolation was thus performed by taking\ninto account the spatial structure of these additional correction factors to\nprovide a continuous correction factor map. Finally, the existing and the\ncorrection factor maps were summed to improve the Vieilledent's AGB map. The\nresults showed that the integration of GLAS data improves the precision of\nVieilledent's AGB map by approximately 7 t/ha. By integrating GLAS data, the\nRMSE on AGB estimates decreases from 81 t/ha (R 2 = 0.62) to 74.1 t/ha (R 2 =\n0.71). Most importantly, we showed that this approach using LiDAR data avoids\nunderestimating high biomass values (new maximum AGB of 650 t/ha compared to\n550 t/ha with the first approach).\n",

On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect\nunderlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships\nbetween the elements of a biological system, according to the motto \"throw away\nthe physics, keep the organisation\". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic\nmodels that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might\nhave deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own\nwork.

In this article, both the\nmathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate\nto his philosophical ideas.

The\nstrengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison\nwith current network biology literature.

VetStat was established in\n2000, as a national database containing detailed information on purchases of\nveterinary medicine. This paper presents a critical set of challenges\noriginating from static system features, which researchers must address when\nestimating antimicrobial exposure in Danish pig herds. Most challenges\npresented are followed by at least one robust solution. A set of challenges\nrequiring awareness from the researcher, but for which no immediate solution\nwas available, were also presented. The selection of challenges and solutions\nwas based on a consensus by a cross-institutional group of researchers working\nin projects using VetStat data. No quantitative data quality evaluations were\nperformed, as the frequency of errors and inconsistencies in a dataset will\nvary, depending on the period covered in the data. Instead, this paper focuses\non clarifying how VetStat data may be translated to an estimation of the\nantimicrobial exposure at herd level, by suggesting uniform methods of\nextracting and editing data, in order to obtain reliable and comparable\nestimates on pig antimicrobial consumption for research purposes.\n",

These\nsymmetries are an addition to symmetries described by the second parity rule of\nChargaff. These new symmetries and their rules concern collective probabilities\nof oligonucleotides from special tetra-groups and their subgroups in long\nDNA-texts including complete sets of chromosomes of human and some model\norganisms. These rules of tetra-group probabilities are considered as possible\ncandidacies for the role of universal rules of long DNA-sequences. A\nquantum-informational model of genetic symmetries of these collective\nprobabilities is proposed on the basis of the known quantum-mechanic statement\nthat quantum state of a multicomponent system is defined by the tensor product\nof quantum states of its subsystems. In this model, nitrogenous bases C, T, G,\nA of DNA are represented as computational basis states of 2-qubit quantum\nCTGA-systems. The biological meaning of these new quantum-information\nsymmetries of long DNA texts is associated with the common ability of all\nliving organisms to grow and develop on the basis of incorporation into their\nbody of new and new molecules of nutrients becoming new quantum-mechanic\nsubsystems of the united quantum-mechanic organism. An important role of\nresonances, photons and photonic crystals in quantum information genetics is\nnoted.\n",

Plots of the ionic current in the recovery region reveal\nthe presence of two outward currents with quasilinear segments. The first one\nhas never been detected with voltage clamp experiments. The plot of currents in\nthe action potential frame of reference reveals that the modulated Ohm's\ncurrent determines the reversal of the ionic current from incoming to outward\nin the recovery region. We show that this current is sodium current caused by\nOhm current buildup of the electrostatic gradient across the membrane opposing\nand overwhelming sodium's concentration gradient. Fits of fractions of open\nsodium channels with the Avrami equation reveal the continuous phase changes of\nthe sodium channels lattice at the inception and at the peak of the action\npotential. The correlation between the Avrami parameter A and the ionic\nchannel's temperature dependent time rate reveals the role of the\nfine-structure constant in the passage of ions through channels. Plots of ionic\ntime rates as Boltzmann's kinetic rates yield temperature independent ionic\nactivation and deactivation energies suggesting a potential quantum mechanical\ninfluence, such as tunneling. The optimum sodium channel density is calculated\nthat is close to the observed one. It is shown that action potential traverses\na heat releasing ferroelectric hysteresis loop with sodium channels traversing\ntwo states with different symmetries. Presented results provide the framework\nfor further analysis of excitability, channel's lattice structure,\nthermodynamic phase behavior, and the role of quantum mechanics mediating the\nflow of ions through channels.

As we worked together, Lesser and I\nrealized that the questions asked of those solutions were quite different in\nbiology from those in the physical chemistry he knew. Biology is inherited.\nInformation is passed by handfuls of atoms in the genetic code. A few atoms in\nthe proteins built from the code change macroscopic function. Indeed, a few\natoms often control biological function in the same sense that a gas pedal\ncontrols the speed of a car. Biological questions then are most productive when\nthey are asked in the context of evolution. What function does a system\nperform? How is the system built to perform that function? What forces are used\nto perform that function? How are the modules that perform functions connected\nto make the machinery of life. Physiologists have shown that much of life is a\nnested hierarchy of devices, one on top of another, linking atomic ions in\nconcentrated solutions to current flow through proteins, current flow to\nvoltage signals, voltage signals to changes in current flow, all connected to\nmake a regenerative system that allows electrical action potentials to move\nmeters, under the control of a few atoms. The hierarchy of devices allows\nmacroscopic properties to emerge from atomic scale interactions. The structures\nof biology create these devices. The concentration and electrical fields of\nbiology power these devices, more than anything else. The resulting organisms\nreproduce. Evolution selects the organisms that reproduce more and thereby\nselects the devices that allow macroscopic control to emerge from the atomic\nstructures of genes and proteins and their motions.\n",

Bio. 49, 13-50 (1987)] is improved by\nconsidering the categories of the theory as fuzzy sets whose elements are the\ncomposite objects formed by the arrows and corresponding vertices of their\nembedded graphs. This way each category can be represented as a point in the\nstates space [0.1]**N. The introduction of a diffeomorphism, that acts in this\ncontext as a functor between categories, allows to define a measure preserving\ndynamical system. In particular, we apply this formalism to describe a living\nsingle cell. We propose for its state at a given time a hirerchical category\nwith three levels (molecular, coarse-grained and cellular levels) related by\nadequate colimits. Each level involves the main functional and structural\nmodules in which the cell can be partitioned. The time evolution of the cell is\ndrived by a transformation which is a N-dimensional generalization of the\nRicker map whose parameters we propose to be determined by requiring that, as\nhallmark of its behavior, the living cell to evolve at the edge of chaos. From\nthe dynamical point of view this property manifests in the fact that the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero. Since in a rather complete model of\nthe living cell the huge number of involved parameters can make of the\ncalculations a hard task, we also propose a toy model, with fewer parameters to\nbe determined, which emphasizes the cellular fission.\n",

The current research focuses on assessing the impact of forest\nfire severity on terrestrial ecosystem productivity using different burn\nindices in Uttarakhand, India. Satellite-based land surface temperature (LST)\nwas calculated for pre-fire (2014) and fire (2016) year using MODerate\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to identify the burn area hotspots\nacross all eco-regions in Uttarakhand. In this study, spatial and temporal\nchanges of different vegetation and burn area indices i.e Normalized Burn Ratio\n(NBR), Burnt Area Index (BAI), Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI), Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI),\nEnhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index\n(NDVI)were estimated for both pre-fire and fire years. Additionally, two Light\nUse Efficiency (LUE) models i.e Carnegie- Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) and\nVegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) were selected to quantify the terrestrial\nNet Primary Productivity (NPP) in pre-fire and fire years across all biomes of\nthe study area.The present approach appears to be promising and has a potential\nin quantifying the loss of ecosystem productivity due to forest fires. A\ndetailed field observation data is required for further training, and testing\nof remotely sensed fire maps for future research.\n",

In\nprevious papers we have verified various predictions of this using the Uniprot\ndatabase but here we explore a novel predicted relationship between the longest\nproteins and evolutionary time. We demonstrate from both theory and experiment\nthat the longest protein and the total number of proteins are intimately\nrelated by Information Theory and we give a simple formula for this. We stress\nthat no evolutionary explanation is necessary; it is an intrinsic property of a\nCoHSI system. While the CoHSI distribution favors the appearance of proteins\nwith fewer than 750 amino acids (characteristic of most functional proteins or\ntheir constituent domains) its intrinsic asymptotic power-law also favors the\nappearance of unusually long proteins; we predict that there are as yet\nundiscovered proteins longer than 45,000 amino acids. In so doing, we draw an\nanalogy between the process of protein folding driven by favorable pathways (or\nfunnels) through the energy landscape of protein conformations, and the\npreferential information pathways through which CoHSI exerts its constraints in\ndiscrete systems.\n  Finally, we show that CoHSI predicts the recent appearance in evolutionary\ntime of the longest proteins, specifically in eukaryotes because of their\nricher unique alphabet of amino acids, and by merging with independent\nphylogenetic data, we confirm a predicted consistent relationship between the\nlongest proteins and documented and potential undocumented mass extinctions.\n",

The aim of this study was\nto determine the living taxonomic composition of the fauna of extinct mammals,\nand throughout the paleontological study of the deeper level of said tank\n(Level IX). The extracted material which it is currently stored in the\nwarehouse of paleontological collections of the National Museum of Natural\nHistory in Havana, Cuba (MNHNCu) was analyzed. We proceeded to clean the bones,\nto classify and to identify them from the species and also the taphonomic\nanalysis of the condition of the remains. It was found that the mammal fauna of\nthe paleontological deposit under study is composed essentially of 3 orders, 7\nfamilies and 14 species. The most significative order is Chiroptera (bat\nfauna), represented by 4 families, 9 genus and 9 species of the total which\nwere identified. There were reported four species of bats Erophylla sezecorni,\nMonophyllus redmani, Pteronotus parnelli and Tadarida brasiliensis in the\nlocation. The results are the basis of the future paleoecological studies in\norder to reconstruct the natural history of these species. Moreover, the\ndiscovery of new species in this area is a contribution to the knowledge about\nthe distribution of these species in the Cuban archipelago and the age of them.\nFinally, the taphonomic analysis of the conservation status of these remains\npermitted the understanding of the processes that gave rise to the tank and its\ncharacteristics, and also it contribute to an adequate estimation of the\nspecies present in it and the relationship between spatiotemporal with the\nfossil.\n",

Generic\nfinite-dimensional dynamical systems (which encompass most models of neural\nnetworks, intracellular signaling cascades, and gene regulatory networks) fall\nshort of universal computation, but are assumed to be capable of explaining\ncognition and development. I present a class of models that bridge two concepts\nfrom distant fields: combinatory logic (or, equivalently, lambda calculus) and\nRNA molecular biology. A set of basic RNA editing rules can make it possible to\ncompute any computable function with identical algorithmic complexity to that\nof Turing machines. The models do not assume extraordinarily complex molecular\nmachinery or any processes that radically differ from what we already know to\noccur in cells. Distinct independent enzymes can mediate each of the rules and\nRNA molecules solve the problem of parenthesis matching through their secondary\nstructure. In the most plausible of these models all of the editing rules can\nbe implemented with merely cleavage and ligation operations at fixed positions\nrelative to predefined motifs. This demonstrates that universal computation is\nwell within the reach of molecular biology. It is therefore reasonable to\nassume that life has evolved - or possibly began with - a universal computer\nthat yet remains to be discovered. The variety of seemingly unrelated\ncomputational problems across many scales can potentially be solved using the\nsame RNA-based computation system. Experimental validation of this theory may\nimmensely impact our understanding of memory, cognition, development, disease,\nevolution, and the early stages of life.\n",

Using satellite-derived continuous forest cover change\ndata, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, and agricultural\nproduction data, and local demographic and geographic variables to assess\nmultilevel forces driving significant local forest cover loss and gain outside\nprotected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes\nthat drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, we\nconstructed models of change in each direction. Although forest cover change\nvaried by country, national level population change was the strongest driver of\nforest loss rate for all countries, with a population doubling predicted to\ncause 2.06 percent annual cover loss, while doubling tea production was\npredicted to cause 1.90 percent. The rate of forest cover gain was associated\npositively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but\nnegatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting\nproduction drivers at multiple levels mitigate reforestation. We found a small,\nbut significant, decrease of forest cover loss rate with increasing distance\nfrom protected areas, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape\nchange near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate\nof forest cover gain, cover loss also correlated to lower local population\ndensity, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale\nforces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and\nmarket forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of\nchange, calling into question the necessary scale of forest protection policy\nin this biodiversity hotspot.\n",

METHODS We developed a modified stacked\nauto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We\napplied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19\nacross China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by\nWHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms\nto group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.\nRESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across\nChina from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,\nthe estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step\nforecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted\nthat the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the\nforecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,\n2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The\naccuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was\nhigh. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of\nApril. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can\naccurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the\nprovinces/cities in China.

To address this issue, this paper\nproposes to use people's heart rate variability (HRV) as an alternative\nindicator of thermal comfort. Since HRV is linked to homeostasis, we\nhypothesize that it could be used to predict people's thermal comfort status.\nTo test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear HRV\nindices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and\na hot environment. The resulting HRV indices were used as inputs to machine\nlearning classification algorithms. We observed that HRV is distinctively\naltered depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to\nsteadfastly predict each subject's thermal environment (cold, neutral, and hot)\nwith up to a 93.7% prediction accuracy. The result of this study implies that\nit could be possible to design automatic real-Time thermal comfort controllers\nbased on people's HRV.\n",

To this\npurpose, we introduce two extra principles to the thermodynamic ones, which are\n(mathematically) compatible with the traditional principles, but have no\nmeaning in inert matter. A traditional balance equation for metabolism will be\nthen extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We consider\nfar from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of\nglobal entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A\nclose analysis of this term will be carried on, both in terms of a diffusion\nequation of biomass over complexity and, as a complementary approach and as a\ntool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schroedinger's method for\nhis equation in Quantum Mechanics. We borrow from this equation just the\noperatorial approach and, this, in a classical frame, as we use real\ncoefficients instead of complex ones, away thus from the mathematical frame of\nquantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple\nmathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over\ncomplexity, as for evolution. We then elaborate, from the existence of\ndifferent time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy\nand negative entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze\nmetabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant\ncoefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which seem to fit empirical data.\nFinally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed,\nalso in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).\n",

The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of\ncountry outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by\nthe model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of\nrobust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread\nof the disease.

Precision/Personalized evidence-based\nmedicine (pEBM) requires theoretical support for decision making and\ninformation management. This study aims to provide the required methodological\nframework. Generalized Resemblance Theory of Evidence mainly rests upon\nGeneralized Theory of Uncertainty which manages information as generalized\nconstraints rather than limited statistical data, and also Prototype\nResemblance Theory of Disease which defines diseases/conditions when there is a\nsimilarity relationship with prototypes (best examples of the disease). The\nproposed theory explains that precisely-personalized structure of evidence is\nformed as a generalized constraint on particular research questions, where the\nconstraining relation deals with averaged effect sizes of studies and its\ncomparison to null hypothesis; which might be of either probabilistic or\npossibilistic nature. Similarity measures were employed to deal with\ncomparisons of high-dimensional characteristics. Real examples of a\nmeta-analysis and its clinical application are provided. This is one of the\nfirst attempts for introducing a framework in medicine, which provides optimal\nbalance between generalizability of formed evidence and homogeneity of studied\npopulations.\n",

These organisms and their cells are\nontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing\nnon-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These\nassociation patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed.\nThis contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed\ncause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these\nintrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental\none that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary\ngland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological\nprinciples. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to\napply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or\ncomputer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based\non proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as\nfundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default\nstate of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle\nof organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological\ncomponent, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains\ncollagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless\nconstrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and\nii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their\nability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can\nbe interpreted in terms of closure of constraints...\n",

In the second approach, the whole RNA\ngenome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a\n\"space\". Rank--frequency distributions are studied in both cases. Within the\nfirst approach, the P\\'olya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield\nthe best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we\nhave calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length,\nand its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the\nclassification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes\nspanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In\ncertain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well\ncalling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the\nclassification. We also observed that the fourth most frequent nucleotide\nsequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case\nof human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and\nSARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses).

Like\nSARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 are thought to originate in bats and then\nspread to humans through intermediate hosts. Identifying intermediate host\nspecies is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms\nof COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains\na key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that\nreflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial\nmutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study\ninvestigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different\nspecies, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human\nand monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the\nhighest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values.\nIn terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and\nhuman. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live\npoultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection\nin these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether\nmouse and cat are true intermediate hosts. These findings suggest that animals\nclosely related to human life, especially those with high HGS, need to be\nclosely monitored.\n",

Methods: By\nreference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens\nseeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure\nthe germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and\nexpression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower\nreaches. Key results: Under simulated drought stress, there is no distinct\ndifference between the mutagenized impatiens and the normal impatiens in terms\nof germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the\nrelative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene\nSoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the\nmutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can\nfurther cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:\nIn this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens\nimproves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained\nimpatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher\napplication value in garden virescence.\n",

Metabolic rate of organisms\n(amount of energy produced per unit time) generally increases slower than\norganisms' mass, which has important implications for life organization. This\nphenomenon, when considered across different taxa, is called interspecific\nallometric scaling. Its origin has puzzled scientists for many decades, and\nstill is considered unknown. In this paper we posit that natural selection, as\ndetermined by evolutionary pressures, leads to distribution of resources, and\naccordingly energy, within a food chain, which is optimal from the perspective\nof stability of the food chain, when each species has sufficient amount of\nresources for continuous reproduction, but not too much to jeopardize existence\nof other species. Metabolic allometric scaling is then a quantitative\nrepresentation of this optimal distribution. Taking locomotion and the primary\nmechanism for distribution of energy, we developed a biomechanical model to\nfind energy expenditures, considering limb length, skeleton mass and speed.\nUsing the interspecific allometric exponents for these three measures and\nsubstituting into the locomotion-derived model for energy expenditure, we\ncalculated allometric exponents for mammals, reptiles, fish and birds, and\ncompared these values with allometric exponents derived from experimental\nobservations. The calculated allometric exponents were nearly identical to\nexperimentally observed exponents for mammals, and very close for fish,\nreptiles and the basal metabolic rate of birds. The main result of the study is\nthat the metabolic allometric scaling is a function of a mechanism of optimal\nenergy distribution between the species of a food chain. This optimized sharing\nof common resources provides stability of a food chain for a given habitat and\nis guided by evolutionary pressures and natural selection.\n",

Its brain model\nuses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition\nlogic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),\nand create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift\nregisters that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse\ntrain that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that\nconsist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive\nthe actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these\nindividuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the\nability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of\ngetting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community.\nThey evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for\neach avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an\nobject that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of\nthe fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed\nin its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add\nplus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the\nanimal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve\nthat allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow\nthe animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using\npermanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So,\ninformation is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one\nlogic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic)\nconnections between cells.\n",

When the mass of organisms\nincreases, the metabolic rate also increases (usually as a power function of\nmass), but usually slower than mass. This effect is called metabolic allometric\nscaling. Its causes are considered unknown. The effect has important\nimplications for individual and population organismal development. It was shown\nin the first part of this study, presented in a separate paper, that in the\ncase of multicellular organisms, this effect is a consequence of natural\nselection and optimization of nutrient distribution between the species of a\nfood chain, sharing resources of a common habitat. Here, in the second part\nthat studies unicellular organisms, we discover that the same principle of\nnatural selection guided by optimization of nutrient distribution between the\nspecies of a food chain defines also metabolic allometric scaling of\nunicellular organisms. To find that, we consider the metabolic properties of\nAmoeba proteus, fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli,\nBacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus. The sharing of nutrients is optimized in\nsuch a way that bigger microorganisms have progressively bigger nutrient influx\nper unit of surface. This evolutionary arrangement secures the stability of a\nfood chain by providing certain metabolic advantages for bigger organisms.\nAccounting for this regular increase of nutrient influx with mass increase, we\nobtained allometric exponents and their ranges close to experimental values,\nthus proving that metabolic allometric scaling of both multicellular and\nunicellular organisms is defined by the same fundamental evolutionary principle\nof optimized sharing of nutrients between the species of a food chain.\n",

Our study is based on\nanalysis of quasi-one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models for ionic\nflows through membrane channels. This class of models includes the Poisson\nequation that determines the electrical potential from the charges present and\nis in that sense consistent. Ussing's flux ratios generally depend on all\nphysical parameters involved in ionic flows, particularly, on bulk conditions\nand channel structures. Certain setups of ion channel experiments result in\nflux ratios that are universal in the sense that their values depend on bulk\nconditions but not on channel structures; other setups lead to flux ratios that\nare specific in the sense that their values depend on channel structures too.\nUniversal flux ratios could serve some purposes better than specific flux\nratios in some circumstances and worse in other circumstances. We focus on two\ntreatments of tracer flux measurements that serve as estimators of important\nproperties of ion channels. The first estimator determines the flux of the main\nion species from measurements of the flux of its tracer. Our analysis suggests\na better experimental design so that the flux ratio of the tracer flux and the\nmain ion flux is universal. The second treatment of tracer fluxes concerns\nratios of fluxes and experimental setups that try to determine some properties\nof channel structure. We analyze the two widely used experimental designs of\nestimating flux ratios and show that the most widely used method depends on the\nspatial distribution of permanent charge so this flux ratio is specific and\nthus allows estimation of (some of) the properties of that permanent charge,\neven with ideal ionic solutions. ...\n",

Case: 844 postoperative\nCABG patients, who were extubated within 24 hours of surgery were identified in\na critical care database (MIMIC-III). Nurse elicited pain scores were\ndocumented throughout their hospital stay on a scale of 0 to 10. Levels were\ntracked as mean, median, and maximum values, and categorized as no (0/10), mild\n(1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe pain (7-10). Regression analysis was employed\nto analyze the relationship between pain scores and outcomes of interest\n(mortality and hospital LOS). After covariate adjustment, increased levels of\npain were found to be associated with lower mortality rates and reduced\nhospital LOS. Conclusion: These counterintuitive results for post-CABG pain\nrelated outcomes have not been previously reported. While not representing\nstrong enough evidence to alter clinical practice, confirmed and reliable\nresults such as these should serve as a research trigger and prompt further\nstudies into unexpected associations between pain and patient outcomes. With\nthe advent of frequent secondary analysis of electronic health records, such\ncounterintuitive data results are likely to become more frequent.

In the case of base sequences in genomes, CoHSI predicts that if we\nsplit the genome into n-tuples (a 2-tuple is a pair of consecutive bases; a\n3-tuple is a trio and so on), without regard for whether or not a region is\ncoding, then each collection of n-tuples will constitute a homogeneous discrete\nsystem and will obey a power-law in frequency of occurrence of the n-tuples. We\nconsider 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-tuples of ten species and demonstrate\nthat the predicted power-law behavior is emphatically present, and furthermore\nas predicted, is insensitive to the start window for the tuple extraction i.e.\nthe reading frame is irrelevant.\n  We go on to provide a proof of Chargaff's second parity rule and on the basis\nof this proof, predict higher order tuple parity rules which we then identify\nin the genome data.\n  CoHSI predicts precisely the same behavior in computer software. This\nprediction was tested and confirmed using 2-, 3- and 4-tuples of the\nhexadecimal representation of machine code in multiple computer programs,\nunderlining the fundamental role played by CoHSI in defining the landscape in\nwhich discrete symbol-based systems must operate.\n",

To optimize the PHA production in accumulator\nreactors, this work evaluated the impact of 1) initial acetate concentration,\n2) light intensity, 3) removal of residual nitrogen on the culture performance.\nResults indicate that low acetate concentration (<30CmM) and specific light\nintensities around 20W/gX are optimal operating conditions that lead to high\npolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage yields (0.83+-0.07 Cmol-PHB/Cmol-Acet) and\nspecific PHB production rates of 2.21+-0.07 Cmol-PHB/Cmol X d. This rate is\nthree times higher than previously registered in non-optimized accumulation\ntests and enabled a PHA content increase from 15 to 30% in less than 4h. Also,\nit was shown for the first time, the capability of a PMC to use a real waste,\nfermented cheese whey, to produce PHA with a hydroxyvalerate (HV) content of\n12%.

We\nhypothesized that individual genes will be distributed on chromosomes in a\nmathematically ordered manner across the animal kingdom. Results. Twenty-one\nanimal genomes reported in the NCBI database were examined. Numerically, there\nwas a trend towards increasing overall gene content with increasing size of the\ngenome as reflected by the chromosomal complement. Gene frequency on individual\nchromosomes in each animal genome was analyzed and demonstrated uniformity of\nproportions within each animal with respect to both average gene frequency on\nindividual chromosomes and gene distribution across the unique genomes.\nFurther, average gene distribution across animal species followed a\nrelationship whereby it was, approximately, inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of the number of chromosomes in the unique animal genomes,\nconsistent with the notion that there is an ordered increase in gene dispersion\nas the complexity of the genome increased. To further corroborate these\nfindings a derived measure, termed gene spacing on chromosomes correlated with\ngene frequency and gene distribution. Conclusion. As animal species have\nevolved, the distribution of their genes on individual chromosomes and within\ntheir genomes, when viewed on a large scale is not random, but follows a\nmathematically ordered process, such that as the complexity of the organism\nincreases, the genes become less densely distributed on the chromosomes and\nmore dispersed across the genome.\n",

The key point in this model is the assumption that the body does\nnot have internal clocks that count out the chronological time at scales of\ndecades. At these scales, we may limit ourselves by empirical consideration\nonly the background (smoothed, averaged) processes. The body is dealing with\ninternal biological factors, which can be considered as the biological clocks\nin suitable parameterization of corresponding variables. The dynamics of these\nvariables is described using a system of autonomous ODEs. A particular\nrepresentation of the right-hand side of equations in the form of quadratic\npolynomials is considered. In the simplest case of one variable we deal with a\nlogistic equation, which has an analytical solution. Such quadratic model is\njustified if it is used to predict the dynamic of aging process for relatively\nsmall time intervals. However, since a well-defined biological interpretation\ncan be given for the quadratic right-hand side of the equations, we can expect\nthat the area of applicability of this simplified empirical model can extend to\nrelatively large time intervals. The considered model is, in our opinion, a\ngood and simple mathematical framework for organizing experimental data. The\nmodel may be useful to quantify and arrange the chains of causal relationships\nthat may appear significant for the development of the aging process.\n",

Each configuration of these entities and sensors that is\nrecreated in successive generations in a given environment thus specifies a\npotentially vast amount of information driving complex development in each\ngeneration.

This\ncontinuing trend towards automation and digitization enables many new\napproaches to microscopy that would have been impossible or impractical without\ncomputer interfaces. Accordingly, todays development of new microscopes most\noften depends on concurrent software development to bring these custom-build\nsystems to life. This dependence on software brings opportunities and\nchallenges. Most importantly, a key challenge while developing new microscopes\nis to develop the appropriate software. Despite the fact that software is\neasily copied and distributed, remarkably few opportunities are available to\nshare experiences creating microscope control software. In turn, this brings\nchallenges in creating maintainable and flexible software code and writing User\nInterfaces (UIs) that are easily used by researchers, who are primarily life\nscientists. To start to address these challenges by identifying common problems\nand shared solutions, we assembled a small group of researchers that develop or\nuse software to control their custom-build microscopes at the Janelia Research\nCampus for a two-day workshop in February 2020.

Conserved\ndomains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms\nin SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of\nthe spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses\nalongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary\nrelationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed\nbetween Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry\ntrajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines\nas early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests\nprofiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside\nmigration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of\nviral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present\nand future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.\n",

Indeed, definitions of\nlife rely on emergent properties (growth, capacity to evolve, agency) only\nsymptomatic of intrinsic functioning. Empirical studies demonstrate that\nbiomolecules including ratcheting or rotating enzymes and ribozymes undergo\nrepetitive conformation state changes driven either directly or indirectly by\nthermodynamic gradients. They exhibit disparate structures, but govern\nprocesses relying on directional physical motion (DNA transcription,\ntranslation, cytoskeleton transport) and share the principle of repetitive\nuniplanar conformation changes driven by thermodynamic gradients, producing\ndependable unidirectional motion: heat engines exploiting thermodynamic\ndisequilibria to perform work. Recognition that disparate biological molecules\ndemonstrate conformation state changes involving directional motion, working in\nself-regulating networks, allows a mechanistic definition: life is a\nself-regulating process whereby matter undergoes cyclic, uniplanar conformation\nstate changes that convert thermodynamic disequilibria into directed motion,\nperforming work that locally reduces entropy. Living things are structures\nincluding an autonomous network of units exploiting thermodynamic gradients to\ndrive uniplanar conformation state changes that perform work. These principles\nare independent of any specific chemical environment, and can be applied to\nother biospheres.\n",

By the\n1970s, clear diagnostic and prognostic benefits from intrapartum fEEG\nmonitoring were reported, but until today, this monitoring technology has\nremained a curiosity.\n  Objectives: Our goal was to review the studies reporting the use of fEEG\nincluding the insights from interpreting fEEG patterns in response to uterine\ncontractions during labor. We also used the most relevant information gathered\nfrom clinical studies to provide recommendations for enrollment in the unique\nenvironment of a labor and delivery unit.\n  Data sources: PubMed.\n  Eligibility criteria: The search strategy was: (\"fetus\"[MeSH Terms] OR\n\"fetus\"[All Fields] OR \"fetal\"[All Fields]) AND (\"electroencephalography\"[MeSH\nTerms] OR \"electroencephalography\"[All Fields] OR \"eeg\"[All Fields]) AND\n(Clinical Trial[ptyp] AND \"humans\"[MeSH Terms]). Because the landscape of fEEG\nresearch has been international, we included studies in English, French,\nGerman, and Russian.\n  Results: From 256 screened studies, 40 studies were ultimately included in\nthe qualitative analysis. We summarize and report features of fEEG which\nclearly show its potential to act as a direct biomarker of fetal brain health\nduring delivery, ancillary to fetal heart rate monitoring. However, clinical\nprospective studies are needed to further establish the utility of fEEG\nmonitoring intrapartum. We identified clinical study designs likely to succeed\nin bringing this intrapartum monitoring modality to the bedside.\n  Limitations: Despite 80 years of studies in clinical cohorts and animal\nmodels, the field of research on intrapartum fEEG is still nascent and shows\ngreat promise to augment the currently practiced electronic fetal monitoring.\n",

The statistical mechanism at the sequence level may play a\nsignificant role in the prebiotic evolution. Based on statistical analysis of\ngenome sequences, it has been observed that there is a close relationship\nbetween the evolution of the genetic code and the organisation of genomes. A\nbiodiversity space for species is constructed based on comparing the\ndistributions of codons in genomes for different species according to\nrecruitment order of codons in the prebiotic evolution, by which a closely\nrelationship between the evolution of the genetic code and the tree of life has\nbeen confirmed. On one hand, the three domain tree of life can be reconstructed\naccording to the distance matrix of species in this biodiversity space, which\nsupports the three-domain tree rather than the eocyte tree. On the other hand,\nan evolutionary tree of codons can be obtained by comparing the distributions\nof the 64 codons in genomes, which agrees with the recruitment order of codons\non the roadmap. This is a simple phylogenomic method to study the origins of\nmetazoan, the evolution of primates, etc. This study should be regarded as an\nexploratory attempt to explain the diversification of the three domains of life\nby statistical mechanism in prebiotic sequence evolution. It is indicated that\nthe number of bases in the triplet codons might be explained statistically by\nthe number of strands in the triplex DNAs.

        "summary": "  The process of morphogenesis is an evolution of the shape of an organism\ntogether with the differentiation of its parts. This process encompasses\nnumerous biological processes ranging from embryogenesis to regeneration\nfollowing crisis such as amputation or transplantation. A fundamental\ntheoretical question is where exactly do these instructions for\n(re-)construction reside and how are they implemented? We have recently\nproposed a set of concepts, aiming to respond to these questions and to provide\nan appropriate mathematical formalization of the geometry of morphogenesis [1].\nFirst, we consider the possibility that evolution of shape is determined by\nepigenetic information, responsible for realization of different types of cell\nevents. Second, we suggest a set of rules for converting this epigenetic\ninformation into instructive signals for cell events for each cell, as well as\nfor transforming it after each cell event. Next we give notions of cell state,\ndetermined by its epigenetic array, and cell event, which is a change of cell\nstate, and formalize development as a graph (tree) of cell states connected by\n5 types of cell events, corresponding to the processes of cell division, cell\ngrowth, cell death, cell movement and cell differentiation. Here we present a\nMorphogenesis Software capable of simulating the evolution of a 3D embryo\nstarting from zygote, following a set of rules based on our theoretical\nassumptions, and thus to provide a proof-of-concept for the hypothesis of\nepigenetic code regulation. The software creates a developing embryo and a\ncorresponding graph of cell events according to the zygotic epigenetic spectrum\nand chosen parameters of the developmental rules. Variation of rules\ninfluencing the resulting shape of an embryo may help elucidating the principal\nlaws underlying pattern formation.\n",

Next, a statistical modeling,\nARIMA-GARCH, is implemented on trend component exhibiting heteroskedasticity,\nautoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to capture the linear\ncharacteristics of the sequence and later, generalized autoregressive\nconditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) is then appropriated for the statistical\nnonlinearity of genome sequence. This modeling approach synthesizes a given\ngenome sequence regarding to its statistical features. Finally, the PDF of a\ngiven sequence is estimated using Gaussian mixture model and based on estimated\nPDF, we determine a new PDF presenting sequences that counteract statistically\nthe original sequence.

Indeed, in DNA we\nencounter the biological \"atoms\", the four nucleotide molecules. At the same\ntime these four nucleotides may be considered as the \"letters\" of an alphabet.\nThese four \"letters\", through a genetic code, generate biological \"words\",\n\"phrases\", \"sentences\" (aminoacids, proteins, cells, living organisms). In this\nspirit we may consider equally well a DNA strand as a mathematical statement.\nInspired by the work of Kurt G\\\"odel, we attach to each DNA strand a G\\\"odel's\nnumber, a product of prime numbers raised to appropriate powers. To each DNA\nchain corresponds a single G\\\"odel's number $G$, and inversely given a\nG\\\"odel's number $G$, we can specify the DNA chain it stands for. Next,\nconsidering a single DNA strand composed of $N$ bases, we study the statistical\ndistribution of $g$, the logarithm of $G$. Our assumption is that the choice of\nthe $m$-th term is random and with equal probability for the four possible\noutcomes. The \"experiment\", to some extent, appears as throwing $N$ times a\nfour-faces die. Through the moment generating function we obtain the discrete\nand then the continuum distribution of $g$. There is an excellent agreement\nbetween our formalism and simulated data. At the end we compare our formalism\nto actual data, to specify the presence of traces of non-random dynamics.\n",

We hypothesized that ontology can be\nused as an integrative platform to classify and analyze HCI and disease\noutcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses,\nhosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations. Various\nCOVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend HCI\nmechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations, we collected\n35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and applied\nliterature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus\ninfections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation\nfor integrative HCI-outcome understanding.

This abundant increase in the\nsequence data arise challenges in the precise information extraction from this\ndata. Since many data analyzing and visualization tools do not support\nprocessing of this huge amount of data. To reduce the size of DNA and protein\nsequence, many scientists introduced various types of sequence compression\nalgorithms such as compress or gzip, Context Tree Weighting (CTW), Lampel Ziv\nWelch (LZW), arithmetic coding, run-length encoding and substitution method\netc. These techniques have sufficiently contributed to minimizing the volume of\nthe biological datasets. On the other hand, traditional compression techniques\nare also not much suitable for the compression of these types of sequential\ndata. In this paper, we have explored diverse types of techniques for\ncompression of large amounts of DNA Sequence Data. In this paper, the analysis\nof techniques reveals that efficient techniques not only reduce the size of the\nsequence but also avoid any information loss. The review of existing studies\nalso shows that compression of a DNA sequence is significant for understanding\nthe critical characteristics of DNA data in addition to improving storage\nefficiency and data transmission. In addition, the compression of the protein\nsequence is a challenge for the research community. The major parameters for\nevaluation of these compression algorithms include compression ratio, running\ntime complexity etc.\n",

The impact of\nCOVID-19 on patient journeys in oncology represents a new risk to\ninterpretation of trial results and its broad applicability for future clinical\npractice. We identify key intercurrent events that may occur due to COVID-19 in\noncology clinical trials with a focus on time-to-event endpoints and discuss\nconsiderations pertaining to the other estimand attributes introduced in the\nICH E9 addendum. We propose strategies to handle COVID-19 related intercurrent\nevents, depending on their relationship with malignancy and treatment and the\ninterpretability of data after them. We argue that the clinical trial objective\nfrom a world without COVID-19 pandemic remains valid. The estimand framework\nprovides a common language to discuss the impact of COVID-19 in a structured\nand transparent manner. This demonstrates that the applicability of the\nframework may even go beyond what it was initially intended for.\n",

The mechanism for the\nsynthesis of DNA is synonymous with the chemical origin of life, and theories\nhave been developed along many lines of reasoning, but resolving all\nrequirements remains a challenge, such as defining an objective path to produce\nsequences of encoded nucleotides paired as adenine to thymine and guanine to\ncytosine. Here, a new theory for the origin of DNA is presented. The theory is\nbased upon three lines of experimental evidence and agreement of structural\nsymmetry between DNA nucleotides and steroid hormones, and introduces a new\nconcept of synthesizing both structural and functional characteristics of DNA\nat the same time within a single unified complex of interleaved tetra-ringed\nstructures, steroid molecules which form reaction vessels that serve as\nco-enzymatic building blocks. The new theory indicates that the establishment\nof the DNA nucleotide code is among the very first synthesis steps. Moreover,\nas a consequence of the intermolecular synthesis of both structural and\nfunctional characteristics within a unified complex, there is a culminating\nprocess step that sets forth in motion both DNA and the steroid structures that\nsubsequently trigger replication and transcription, as well as protein\ntranslation, thereby resulting in the instantaneous release of life function.\n",

The efficacy of the extracts from the plants was evaluated by\nthe reflux extraction method. The phytochemical screening of the aqueous\nextracts of C. arabica shows a remarkable richness in active principles in\ncomparison with the extract of P. tomentosa; including flavonoids, saponosides,\nglycosides, terpenes, sterols, deoxyose, polyphenols and total alkaloids.

The lethal time 50 (TL50%) of the aqueous\nextract of C. arabica was estimated about 6.41 days, and 6.94 days for the\nextract P. tomentosa for the imago of T. confusum. The extracts of P. tomentosa\nis less toxic than the extracts of C. arabica. The allelopathic potentials of\nC. arabica and P. tomentosa tested on germination of the seeds of a weed\nDactyloctenium aegyptium (Poaceae) and two cultivated species, including\nHordeumvulgare and Triticumdurum (Poaceae), show that the inhibitory effect of\nextracts of C. arabica is very highly significant. It manifests itself in the\ngrowth of the aerial and underground part of the H. vulgar and T. durum.

Therefore,\nthis study was designed to examine the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of\nthese plants individually as well as in combination, as a formula against\nrespiratory infections causing pathogens. The tested pathogens were Extended\nSpectrum Beta-Lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL), Beta-Lactamase\nproducing Escherichia coli (BL), Beta-Lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae\n(BL), Beta-Lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BL), Enterobacter\ncloacae, and Beta-Lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus (BL).

Disc diffusion and\nmicrodilution (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) methods were used to evaluate\nthe antibacterial activity while the antibiofilm activity was tested using\ncrystal violet assay. The results showed that A. officinalis and T. cordata\nextracts and fractions exhibited weak antibacterial activity having MIC values\nranged from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL. P. guaja exhibited moderate antibacterial\nactivity with MIC values ranged from 6.25 to 1.56 mg/mL.

Cannon in\nhis \"The wisdom of the body\" (1932) used the engineering vision of regulation.\nIn 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This\nterm causes much debate when one takes it literally, i.e. as a sort of energy.\nSelye did not use the language of mathematics, but the formalization of his\nphenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to\nverifiable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in\nsystems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and\nthe universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors\nwas discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious\nsymptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and\nvolatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many\nobservations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial\ntime series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new\nexperiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of\ndepression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were\ndeveloped: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several\nfamilies of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the first group of\nmodels was based on Selye's concept of adaptation energy and used fitness\nestimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor\nbifurcation and on the advection--diffusion model for distribution of\npopulation in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of\nmodels and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention\nto the results of the last ten years and open questions.\n",

In this review, we will discuss three mathematical approaches for\nstudying cancer biology: population dynamics, gene regulation, and\ndevelopmental biology. If we understand all biochemical mechanisms of cancer\ncells, we can directly calculate how the cancer cell population behaves.\nInversely, just from the cell count data, we can use population dynamics to\ninfer the mechanisms. Cancer cells emerge from certain genetic mutations, which\naffect the expression of other genes through gene regulation. Therefore,\nknowledge of gene regulation can help with cancer prevention and treatment.\nDevelopmental biology studies acquisition and maintenance of normal cellular\nfunction, which is inspiring to cancer biology in the opposite direction.\nBesides, cancer cells implanted into an embryo can differentiate into normal\ntissues, which provides a possible approach of curing cancer. This review\nillustrates the role of mathematics in these three fields: what mathematical\nmodels are used, what data analysis tools are applied, and what mathematical\ntheorems need to be proved. We hope that applied mathematicians and even pure\nmathematicians can find meaningful mathematical problems related to cancer\nbiology.\n",

Many governments\nimplemented COVID quarantine (stay-at-home) orders on the notion that this\nnonpharmaceutical intervention would delay and flatten the epidemic peak and\nlargely benefit public health outcomes. The overall research capacity response\nto COVID since late 2019 has been massive. Given lack of research transparency,\nonly a small fraction of published research has been judged by others to be\nreproducible before COVID. Independent evaluation of published meta-analysis on\na common research question can be used to assess the reproducibility of a claim\ncoming from that field of research. We used a p-value plotting statistical\nmethod to independently evaluate reproducibility of specific research claims\nmade in four meta-analysis studies related to benefits/risks of COVID\nquarantine orders. Outcomes we investigated included: mortality, mental health\nsymptoms, incidence of domestic violence, and suicidal ideation (thoughts of\nkilling yourself). Three of the four meta-analyses that we evaluated\n(mortality, mental health symptoms, incidence of domestic violence) raise\nfurther questions about benefits/risks of this form of intervention. The fourth\nmeta-analysis study (suicidal ideation) is unreliable. Given lack of research\ntransparency and irreproducibility of published research, independent\nevaluation of meta-analysis studies using p-value plotting is offered as a way\nto strengthen or refute (falsify) claims made in COVID research.\n",

Then we derived the response function of individual ants to\npheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and\nchanges in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response\nto local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by\nthese concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over\ntime, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant\ndetermining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a\nWeber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the\ntwo sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the\nturning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the\nwell-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the\nresults of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990).\nHowever, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function\nled to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the\nliterature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that\nin the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be\nderived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations\nthat we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the\npreferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed.\n",

Furthermore, the customary introduction of fundamental biological\nentities such as individual organisms, cells, genes, catalysts and motors\nremains largely descriptive; constructive approaches involving deductive\nreasoning appear, in comparison, almost absent. As a consequence, both the\nlogical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present\narticle describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations\nof biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the\nlanguage and the general methods employed in other disciplines. This approach\nassumes the existence of a certain unity of human knowledge that transcends\ndiscipline boundaries. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason is revised\nthrough the introduction of the complementary concepts of symmetry and\nasymmetry and of necessity and contingency. This is used to explain how these\nfour concepts are involved in the elaboration of theories or laws of nature.\nFour fundamental theories of biology are then identified: cell theory, Darwin's\ntheory of natural selection, an informational theory of life (which includes\nMendel's theory of inheritance) and a physico-chemical theory of life. Atomism\nand deductive reasoning are shown to enter into the elaboration of the concepts\nof natural selection, individual living organisms, cells and their\nreproduction, genes as well as catalysts and motors. This work contributes to\nclarify the philosophical and logical structure of biology and its major\ntheories.

Information gained from our environment acts as a\nhormetic stimulus which up-regulates biological responses and feedback loops,\neventually leading to improved repair of age-related damage.

However, the HH model was\nproposed in 1952 when the real structure of the ion channel was unknown. It is\nnow common knowledge that in many ion-channel proteins the flow of ions through\nthe pore is governed by a gate, comprising a so-called selectivity filter\ninside the ion channel, which can be controlled by electrical interactions. The\nselectivity filter is believed to be responsible for the selection and fast\nconduction of particular ions across the membrane of an excitable cell. Other\n(generally larger) parts of the molecule such as the pore-domain gate control\nthe access of ions to the channel protein. In fact, two types of gates are\nconsidered here for ion channels: the external gate, which is the voltage\nsensitive gate, and the internal gate which is the selectivity filter gate\n(SFG). Some quantum effects are to expected in the SFG due to its small\ndimensions, which may play an important role in the operation of an ion\nchannel. Here, we examine parameters in a generalized model of HH to see\nwhether any parameter affects the spike generation. Our results indicate that\nthe previously suggested semi-quantum-classical equation proposed by Bernroider\nand Summhammer (BS) agrees strongly with the HH equation under different\nconditions and may even provide a better explanation in some cases.

Several species of teleosts are known to have\nmagnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field\ndetection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly\nnarrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that\nmagnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates\nthe impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.\nHowever, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several\nteleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present\nin many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect\nmagnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as\ndemonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer\nfrom inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic\ndetection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies\ndepends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in\ntarget teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in teleost species must be\nindependently tested with adequate sample sizes.\n",

The impact of food association learning on diet dynamics, inspired\nby a pilot study conducted among Arizona children in Pre-Kindergarten to 8th\ngrades, is used to build simple population-level learning models.\nQualitatively, mathematical studies are used to highlight the possible\nramifications of instruction, learning in nutrition, and health at the\ncommunity level. Model results suggest that nutrition education programs at the\npopulation-level have minimal impact on improving eating behaviors, findings\nthat agree with prior field studies. Hence, the incorporation of food\nassociation learning may be a better strategy for creating resilient\ncommunities of healthy and non-healthy eaters. A \\textit{Ratatouille} effect\ncan be observed when food association learners become food preference learners,\na potential sustainable behavioral change, which in turn, may impact the\noverall distribution of healthy eaters. In short, this work evaluates the\neffectiveness of population-level intervention strategies and the importance of\ninstitutionalizing nutrition programs that factor in economical, social,\ncultural, and environmental elements that mesh well with the norms and values\nin the community.\n",

Today, however, theoretical biology\nhas generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.\nThis could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a\n\"data first\", rather than a \"theory first\", approach is preferred. Moreover,\ngenerating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.\nThis situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be\ndisentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology\nand medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological\nsciences. This paper makes the case for a \"philosophical biology\"\n(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology\n(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through\nphilosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of\ntheoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word \"theory\" and making\nuse of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural\nsciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given\nbiological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along\nwith a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or\nnot the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be\nsecondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not.

These distributions show that the first three recalls come from\nthe emptying of working memory, recalls 6 and above come from a second stage\nand the 4th and 5th recalls are mixtures of the two. A discontinuity, a rounded\nstep function, is shown to exist in the fitted linear slope of the recall\ndistributions as the recall shifts from the emptying of working memory\n(positive slope) to the second stage (negative slope). The discontinuity leads\nto a first estimate of the capacity of working memory at 4-4.5 items. Working\nmemory accounts for the recency effect. The primacy effect comes from the\nsecond stage with a contribution also from working memory for short lists (the\nfirst item). The different slopes of the working memory and secondary stages,\nand that the two have different functional forms, accounts for the u-shaped\nserial position curve. The total recall is shown to be a linear combination of\nthe content of working memory and items recalled in the second stage with\n3.0-3.9 items coming from working memory, a second estimate of the capacity of\nworking memory.

These times to retrieve an additional item obey a second\nlinear relationship as a function of the recall probability averaged over the\nexperiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and\nwhether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear\nrelationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow,\n2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation\nmechanism as recognition or cued recall.

The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double\ninteger items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to\nreactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian\ncollege students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average\nnumber of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item\ntest, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of\nother qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,\nindicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at\n3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity\nlimit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered\ndecreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most\nsubjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items\nincreased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty\nin managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any\nitems correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson\ncorrelation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively\nsmall 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have\nimportant consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and\ntest design. Because working memory scores are important for academic\nachievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by\nlearning how to manage her or his capacity limit.\n",

Accordingly an important issue concerning\nthe evolution of life is assessing the thermodynamic efficiency of the\ncomputations performed by organisms. This issue is interesting both from the\nperspective of how close life has come to maximally efficient computation\n(presumably under the pressure of natural selection), and from the practical\nperspective of what efficiencies we might hope that engineered biological\ncomputers might achieve, especially in comparison with current computational\nsystems. Here we show that the computational efficiency of translation, defined\nas free energy expended per amino acid operation, outperforms the best\nsupercomputers by several orders of magnitude, and is only about an order of\nmagnitude worse than the Landauer bound. However this efficiency depends\nstrongly on the size and architecture of the cell in question. In particular,\nwe show that the {\\it useful} efficiency of an amino acid operation, defined as\nthe bulk energy per amino acid polymerization, decreases for increasing\nbacterial size and converges to the polymerization cost of the ribosome. This\ncost of the largest bacteria does not change in cells as we progress through\nthe major evolutionary shifts to both single and multicellular eukaryotes.\nHowever, the rates of total computation per unit mass are nonmonotonic in\nbacteria with increasing cell size, and also change across different biological\narchitectures including the shift from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes.\n",

It has been shown that lunar cycles\nindeed have effects on animals; significant associations between human\ncircadian rhythms and lunar cycles have also been reported. We set out to\ndetermine whether a significant statistical correlation exists between the\nlunar phase and sex determination during conception. We found that significant\nassociations (\\textit{p}-value $< 5 \\times 10^{-5}$) exist between the average\nsex ratio (male:female) and the lunar month. The likelihood of conception of a\nmale is at its highest point five days after the full moon, whereas the highest\nlikelihood of female conception occurs nineteen days after the full moon.\nFurthermore, we found that the strength of this influence is correlated with\nthe amount of solar radiation (which is proportional to moonlight). Our results\nsuggest that sex determination may be influenced by the moon cycle, which\nsuggests the possibility of lunar influence on other biological phenomena. We\nsuggest for future research the exploration of similar effects in other\nphenomena involving humans and other species.\n",

Here we consider the insight that\nCoHSI might bring to a different problem, the distribution of identical\nproteins across species. Horizontal and Vertical Gene Transfer (HGT/VGT) both\nlead to the replication of protein sequences across species through a diversity\nof mechanisms some of which remain unknown. In contrast, CoHSI predicts from\nfundamental theory that such systems will demonstrate power law behavior\nindependently of any mechanisms, and using the Uniprot database we show that\nthe global pattern of protein re-use is emphatically linear on a log-log plot\n(adj. $R^{2} = 0.99, p < 2.2 \\times 10^{-16}$ over 4 decades); i.e. it is\nextremely close to the predicted power law. Specifically we show that over 6.9\nmillion proteins in TrEMBL 18-02 are re-used, i.e. their sequence appears\nidentically in between 2 and 9,812 species, with re-used proteins varying in\nlength from 7 to as long as 14,596 amino acids. Using (DL+V) to denote the\nthree domains of life plus viruses, 21,676 proteins are shared between two\n(DL+V); 22 between three (DL+V) and 5 are shared in all four (DL+V). Although\nthe majority of protein re-use occurs between bacterial species those proteins\nmost frequently re-used occur disproportionately in viruses, which play a\nfundamental role in this distribution.\n  These results suggest that diverse mechanisms of gene transfer (including\ntraditional inheritance) are irrelevant in determining the global distribution\nof protein re-use.\n",

As the atmosphere warms without additional water\nvapor input, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases as well. Increased\ntemperatures and accompanied elevated VPD levels can both lead to negative\nimpacts on crop yield. The independent importance of VPD, however, is often\nneglected or conflated with that from temperature due to a tight correlation\nbetween the two climate factors. We used a coupled process-based crop (MAIZSIM)\nand soil (2DSOIL) model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the independent\nroles temperature and VPD play in crop yield projections, as well as their\ninteractions with rising CO2 levels and changing precipitation patterns. We\nfound that by separating out the VPD effect from rising temperatures, VPD\nincreases had a greater negative impact on yield compared to that from warming.\nThe negative impact of these two factors varied with precipitation levels and\ninfluenced yield through separate mechanisms. Warmer temperatures caused yield\nloss mainly through shortening the growing season, while elevated VPD increased\nwater loss and triggered several water stress responses such as reduced\nphotosynthetic rates, lowered leaf area development, and shortened growing\nseason length. Elevated CO2 concentrations partially alleviated yield loss\nunder warming or increased VPD conditions through water savings, but the impact\nlevel varied with precipitation levels and was most pronounced under drier\nconditions. These results demonstrate the key role VPD plays in crop growth and\nyield, displaying a magnitude of impact comparative to temperature and CO2. A\nmechanistic understanding of the function of VPD and its relation with other\nclimate factors and management practices is critical to improving crop yield\nprojections under a changing climate.\n",

Here, the authors reasoned that for sustained resonance signaling, the\nnumber of oscillating DNA sequences per genome should be exceptionally high and\nthat, therefore, genomic repeats of various sizes are good candidates for\nserving as resonators. Moreover, it was suggested that for the two DNA\nsequences to resonate, they do not necessarily have to be identical. Therefore,\nthe existence of sequences differing in the primary sequence but having similar\nresonating sub-structures was proposed. It was hypothesized that such\nsequences, named HIDERs, would be enriched in the genomes of multicellular\nspecies. Specifically, it was hypothesized that delocalized electron clouds of\npurine-pyrimidine sequences could serve as the basis of HIDERs. The consequent\ngenomic analysis confirmed the enrichment of purine-pyrimidine HIDERs in a few\nselected genomes of mammals, an insect, and a plant, compared to randomized\nsequence controls. Similarly, it was suggested that hypothetical delocalized\nproton clouds of the hydrogen bonds of multiple stacked bases could serve as\nsequence-dependent hydrogen-bond-based HIDERs. Similarly, the enrichment of\nsuch HIDERs was observed. It is suggested that these enrichments are the first\nevidence in support of sequence-specific resonance signaling in the genome.\n",

In addition, the cost\nof the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for\npoorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a\ntest methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single\ntest. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample\nlikely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It\nthereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore,\nrequires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat\nincreased false negatives.

After admixture, some\nindividuals with admixed autosomes carried the modern Homo Sapiens uniparental\nDNAs, while the rest carried the archaic versions. Coevolution of admixed\nautosomes and uniparental DNAs is expected to cause some of the sites in modern\nuniparental DNAs to revert back to archaic alleles, while the opposite process\nwould occur (from archaic to modern) in some of the sites in archaic\nuniparental DNAs. This type of coevolution is one of the elements that\ndifferentiate the two different models of the Y phylogenetic tree of modern\nhumans, rooting it either in Africa or East Asia. The expected reversion to\narchaic alleles is assumed to occur and is easily traceable in the Asia model,\nbut is absent in the Africa model due to its infinite site assumption, which\nalso precludes the independent or convergent mutation to modern alleles in\narchaic uniparental DNAs since mutations are assumed to occur randomly across a\nneutral genome, and convergent evolution is assumed not to occur. Here, we\nexamined newly published high coverage Y chromosome sequencing data of two\nDenisovan and two Neanderthal samples to determine whether they carry\nmodern-Homo Sapiens alleles in sites where they are not supposed to according\nto the Africa model. The results showed that a significant fraction of the\nsites that, according to the Asia model, should differentiate the original\nmodern Y from the original archaic Y carried modern alleles in the archaic Y\nsamples here. Some of these modern alleles were shared among all archaic humans\nwhile others could differentiate Denisovans from Neanderthals.

The main novelty of the model is that it keeps track of the date of\ninfection of a single individual and uses stochastic distributions to aggregate\nindividuals who share the same date of infection. In addition, it uses two\ntypes of infections, mild and serious, with a different recovery time.

They were\ndescribed by Lansdown Guilding (1797-1831). This paper identifies the landmarks\nof their study, in a worldwide level, for almost 200 years. The beginning,\n1826-1879, was based on describing their anatomy with light miscroscopy, mostly\nby famous French naturalists such as Milne-Edwards and Blanchard. In 1880-1929\npeiord, work concentrated in anatomy, physiology, behavior, biogeography and\necology, but the most important work was Bouvier`s mammoth monograph. The next\nperiod, 1930-1979, was important for the discovery of Cambrian species; Vachons\nexplanation of how ancient distribution defined the existence of two families;\nPioneer DNA and electron microscopy from Brazil; and primitive attempts at\nsystematics using embryology or isolated anatomical characteristics. Finally,\nthe 1980-2020 period, with research centered in Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica\nand Germany, is marked by an evolutionary approach to everything, from body and\nbehavior to distribution; for the solution of the old problem of how they form\ntheir adhesive net and how the glue works; the reconstruction of Cambrian\nonychophoran communities, the first experimental taphonomy; the first\ncountrywide map of conservation status (from Costa Rica); the first model of\nwhy they survive in cities; the discovery of new phenomena like food hiding,\nparental feeding investment and ontogenetic diet shift; and for the birth of a\nnew research branh, Onychophoran Etnobiology, founded in 2015,\n",

In many fish\nspecies, the spawning phenology is sensitive to environmental factors that\nmodulate or trigger the spawning event, which differ between regions and\nseasons. In addition, climate change may also alter patterns of reproductive\nphenology at the community level. Usually, hatch-date distributions are\ndetermined back-calculating the age estimated on calcified structures from the\ncapture date. However, these estimated distributions could be biased due to\nmortality processes or time spaced samplings derived from fishery. Here, we\npresent a Bayesian approach that functions as a predictive model for the\nhatching date of individuals from a fishery-dependent sampling with temporal\nbiases. We show that the shape and shift of the observed distribution is\ncorrected. This model can be applied in fisheries with multiple cohorts, for\nspecies with a wide geographical distribution and living under contrasting\nenvironmental regimes and individuals with different life histories such as\nthermo-dependent growth, length-dependent mortality rates, etc.\n",

Several models have been proposed to explain the\nregularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at\ndifferent latitudes on Earth.

Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the\nregularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that\nseasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with\nlatitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B\nand A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism.\nSuch an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to\nhundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of\nimmunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal\noscillations.\n",

Such signals coordinated with the nucleocapsid helical\nstructure were detected and reconstructed in the genomes of the coronaviruses\nSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The main period of the signals for both viruses was\nabout 54 nt, that implies 6.75 nt per N protein.

Imaging technologies are now used throughout the\nlife and biomedical sciences to achieve discovery and understanding of\nbiological mechanisms in the basic sciences as well as assessment, diagnosis\nand therapeutic intervention in clinical trials and animal and human medicine.\nThe universal application and use of imaging raises an important question and\nopportunity: what is the value and ultimate destination of biological and\nmedical imaging data? In the last few years, several informatics and data\nscience technologies have matured sufficiently so that routine publication of\nthese datasets is now possible. Participants in Global BioImaging from 15\ncountries and all populated continents have agreed on the need for\nrecommendations and guidelines for the establishment of image data repositories\nand the formats they use for delivering data to the global scientific\ncommunity. This white paper presents a shared, global view of criteria for\nthese common, globally applicable guidelines and provisional proposals for open\ntools and resources that are available now and can provide a foundation for\nfuture development.\n",

One of the most famous interspecific\nconsiderations of cancer is Peto's paradox, which asserts that organisms with\nvastly different body mass are expected to have a vastly different degree of\ncancer risk, a pattern that is not observed empirically. Here we show that this\nobservation is not a paradox at all but follows naturally from the\ninterspecific scaling of metabolic rates across mammalian body size. We connect\nmetabolic allometry to evolutionary models of cancer development in tissues to\nshow that waiting time to cancer scales with body mass in a similar way as\nnormal organism lifespan does. Thus, the expectation across mammals is that\nlifetime cancer risk is invariant with body mass. Peto's observation is\ntherefore not a paradox, but the natural expectation from interspecific scaling\nof metabolism and physiology. These allometric patterns have theoretical\nimplications for understanding life span evolution, and practical implications\nfor using smaller animals as model systems for human cancer.\n",

However, their continuous release into the\naquatic systems calls for the evaluation of their potential accumulation in\nsediments and the role of this matrix as a potential source of these compounds.\nConsidering this, a method based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE),\nextract clean-up by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyte determination by\nliquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was\ndeveloped and validated to analyze 50 relevant (frequently used and/or\nregulated or found in water) medium to highly polar pesticides in sediments.\nThe method showed good performance regarding accuracy (relative recoveries\nbetween 76% and 124%), precision (relative standard deviation values <20%),\nsensitivity (LODs in the low ng/g for most compounds), linearity (coefficients\nof determination >0.99), and matrix effects (negligible for all analytes). The\nuse of an isotope dilution approach for quantification ensures results\nreliability. As a part of the validation process, the method was applied to the\nanalysis of the target pesticides in sediments from the Llobregat River (NE\nSpain) showing the presence of five of them, namely, terbutryn, dichlorvos,\nterbuthylazine, diazinon, and irgarol. All 5 pesticides, due to both the\nconcentrations found and their physical-chemical characteristics, demonstrate\nhigh potential for bioaccumulation and risk to the aquatic organisms.\nAdditional multidisciplinary studies that investigate pesticides occurrence in\nthe different aquatic compartments and evaluate the potential risks for aquatic\necosystems are required to assess the environmental impact and significance of\nthe presence of pesticides in sediments.\n",

The continuous and\nincreasing use of pesticides in agricultural and urban activities results in\nthe pollution of water resources and represents an environmental risk.

In this context, the present\nwork aimed at providing an analytical method for the simultaneous determination\nof trace levels of 51 target pesticides in water and applying it to the\ninvestigation of target pesticides in two agriculture-impacted areas of\ninterest. The method developed, based on an isotopic dilution approach and\non-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,\nis fast, simple, and to a large extent automated, and allows the analysis of\nmost of the target compounds in compliance with European regulations. Further\napplication of the method to the analysis of selected water samples collected\nat the lowest stretches of the two largest river basins of Catalonia (NE\nSpain), Llobregat and Ter, revealed the presence of a wide suite of pesticides,\nand some of them at concentrations above the water quality standards (irgarol\nand dichlorvos) or the acceptable method detection limits (methiocarb,\nimidacloprid, and thiacloprid), in the Llobregat, and much cleaner waters in\nthe Ter River basin. Risk assessment of the pesticide concentrations measured\nin the Llobregat indicated high risk due to the presence of irgarol,\ndichlorvos, methiocarb, azinphos ethyl, imidacloprid, and diflufenican (hazard\nquotient (HQ) values>10), and an only moderate potential risk in the Ter River\nassociated to the occurrence of bentazone and irgarol (HQ>1).\n",

Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design\nand vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a\ngenome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene\nexpression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity,\ngenome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in\nthe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an\nabundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the\ngene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene\nundergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution.\nComparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses\nsuggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus,\nSARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related\ncoronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the\nspike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat\ndistribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature.

Empirical evidence suggests a power-law\nrelation between mass and metabolic rate, namely allometric law. For vascular\norganisms, the exponent $\\beta$ of this power-law is smaller than one, which\nimplies scaling economy; that is, the greater the organism is, the lesser\nenergy per cell it demands. However, the numerical value of this exponent is a\ntheme of an extensive debate and a central issue in comparative physiology. It\nis presented in this work some empirical data and a detailed discussion about\nthe most successful theories to explain these issues. A historical perspective\nis also shown, beginning with the first empirical insights in the sec. 19 about\nscaling properties in biology, passing through the two more important theories\nthat explain the scaling properties quantitatively. Firstly, the Rubner model,\nthat consider organism surface area and heat dissipation to derive $\\beta =\n2/3$.

These results indicate a\npotential mismatch between ecosystem service demand and capacity but also\nprovide a scientific baseline for evidence-based policy which fosters the\ndevelopment of green infrastructure through nature-based innovation promoting\nmore specific and novel solutions for landscape and urban planning.\n",

In this study, a\nfield test was implemented on the M3 generation of two mutant pea plants gained\nfrom previous neutron radiation of pea seeds. The relationship between\nagronomic characteristics and yields of the mutants was investigated. Moreover,\ndifferences in physiological and biochemical properties and seed nutrients were\nanalyzed. The results demonstrated that the plant height, effective pods per\nplant, and yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M1 were 45.0%, 43.2%, and 50.9%\nhigher than those of the control group. Further analysis attributed the\nincrease in yield per plant to the increased branching number. The yield per\nplant of mutant Leaf-M2 was 7.8% higher than that of the control group, which\ncould be related with the increased chlorophyll content in the leaves. There\nwas a significant difference between the two mutants in the increase of yield\nper plant owing to morphological variation between the two mutants. There were\nsignificant differences in SOD activity and MDA content between the two mutants\nand the control, indicating that the physiological regulation of the two\nmutants also changed. In addition, the iron element content of seeds of the two\nmutants were about 10.9% lower than in the seeds of the control group, a\nsignificant difference. These findings indicate that the mutants Leaf-M1 and\nLeaf-M2 have breeding value and material value for molecular biological\nstudies.\n",

A recent surge (second wave) in the\nCOVID-19 cases in Europe and other temperate countries as compared to the\ntropical regions suggests the likely role of solar radiation. We hypothesized\nthat ultraviolet radiation's effect might be a significant factor moderating\nthe spread of the COVID-19 across countries. Regression analysis was done for\nthe UV radiation data for seven hotspot cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Milan,\nMadrid, New York, Melbourne and Sydney) with the daily COVID-19 cases. Global\nerythemal UV radiation values were lower during winter and higher during\nsummer. In general, the daily new COVID-19 cases registered were higher during\nthe winter months having low UV radiation dose (0.5-3.7 kJ m-2). Cases began to\ndecline with summer onset that corresponded to increased UV radiation (2.5-6.7\nkJ m-2). Our studies suggest that the natural UV radiation could be a strong\ndetermining factor moderating the spread of COVID-19 cases. The importance of\nUV radiation in natural sunlight as a disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be\nignored since the lockdowns were lifted; further, it can be considered as a\nfactor for COVID management.\n",

The origin of coronaviruses and the\nrisks of human-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-animal transmission of\ncoronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level\nby detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid\nassembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic\nhuman coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1,\nHCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the\nrelated animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV,\nBat-CoV MOP1, TGEV, and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes\nof coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between\ngenomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional\ngenome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the\nanalysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In\nall coronaviruses RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome\nwith the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer\nand shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the\nexperimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV proved\nthat the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the\npackaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both\ncharacters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make\nthem promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect\nthe recombination and co-infection as well.\n",

The future challenges and\ndevelopments will strongly depend on the progress of national and global\nvaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern, and\npublic responses to nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term,\nmany people are still unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and\nmobility and population mixing is expected to increase over the summer.\nTherefore, policies that lift restrictions too much and too early risk another\ndamaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for\ntransmission due to vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in the\nsummer. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread\nagain, but a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence\nmay strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination\nlevels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain\nnecessary. These epidemiological aspects are put into perspective with the\neconomic, social, and health-related consequences and thereby provide a\nholistic perspective on the future of COVID-19.\n",

        "summary": "  Fetal oxygen delivery and consumption and blood gases in relation to\ngestational age. Oxygen crosses the placenta by diffusion and placental\npermeability to O$_2$ is high. Thus, the fetus receives adequate amounts, but\nvascular Po$_2$ is much lower than after birth. Studies of sustained fetal\nhypoxemia and acute 40-45% hemorrhage show that hypoxemia is not tolerated\nwhereas hemorrhage is. This suggests that if fetal Po$_2$ falls markedly, O$_2$\ndiffusion from blood to tissue is impaired. Uterine blood and umbilical blood\nflows/fetal weight fall progressively with advancing gestation. This results in\nfetal hypoxemia, an increase in Pco$_2$, and decrease in pH. This decreases\nfetal O$_2$ delivery, and in fetal lambs and horses there is a decrease in\nfetal O$_2$ consumption. The decrease in O$_2$ demands is linked to a decrease\nin fetal breathing and body movements and growth rate. The decrease in fetal\nmotility is due to an increase in fetal plasma PGE2 concentration, which begins\nat ~120 days GA in sheep and is due to the prepartum rise in fetal cortisol.\nAlso, adenosine administration to fetal lambs decreases fetal breathing and REM\nsleep and the plasma adenosine concentration increases in late gestation. The\nfetal plasma levels of neurosteroids, which suppress fetal motility, increase\nwith advancing gestation. The prepartum cortisol rise also inhibits fetal\ngrowth. In normal pregnancies, these mechanisms operate effectively to maintain\nan appropriate balance between fetal oxygen consumption and delivery. However,\nin pregnancies with either further reduce O$_2$ delivery or increase fetal\nO$_2$ demands, the mismatch between O$_2$ delivery and consumption may worsen\nleading to IUGR, hypoxic organ damage or stillbirth.\n",

        "summary": "  A genome, composed of a precisely ordered sequence of four nucleotides\n(ATCG), encompasses a multitude of specific genome features like AAA motif.\nMutations occurring within a genome disrupt the sequential order and\ncomposition of these features, thereby influencing the evolutionary\ntrajectories and yielding variants. The evolutionary relatedness between a\nvariant and its ancestor can be estimated by assessing evolutionary distances\nacross a spectrum of genome features. This study develops a novel,\nalignment-free algorithm that considers both the sequential order and\ncomposition of genome features, enabling computation of the Fr\\'echet distance\n(Fr) across multiple genome features to quantify the evolutionary status of a\nvariant. Integrating this algorithm with an artificial recurrent neural network\n(RNN) reveals the quantitative evolutionary trajectory and origin of\nSARS-CoV-2, a puzzle unsolved by alignment-based phylogenetics. The RNN\ngenerates the evolutionary trajectory from Fr data at two levels: genome\nsequence mutations and organism variants. At the genome sequence level,\nSARS-CoV-2 evolutionarily shortens its genome to enhance its infectious\ncapacity. Mutating signature features, such as TTA and GCT, increases its\ninfectious potential and drives its evolution. At the organism level, variants\nmutating a single biomarker possess low infectious potential. However, mutating\nmultiple markers dramatically increases their infectious capacity, propelling\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 likely originates from mink coronavirus\nvariants, with its origin trajectory traced as follows: mink, cat, tiger,\nmouse, hamster, dog, lion, gorilla, leopard, bat, and pangolin. Together,\nmutating multiple signature features and biomarkers delineates the evolutionary\ntrajectory of mink-origin SARS-CoV-2, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In reproducing the original computation, I find that\nthe values of, respectively, within populations, among populations but within\nraces, and among races diversity apportionments shift slightly (86%, 7%, 7%);\nhere, in this \"field guide\" to Lewontin (1972), as well as in Winther (2022), I\ndiscuss this change in light of the values produced in subsequent replications\nof Lewontin's calculation with other statistics and data sets.\n",

The\nprobability transition matrix is used to estimate the number of patients in\neach stage , this matrix along with the rate transition matrix , both are used\nto estimate life expectancy of patients is each stage. These statistical\nindices are of great value as they can help the health policy makers and\nmedical insurance managers to allocate the resources for investigating and\ntreating patients in different stages of the disease . This method is of a high\npotential value to be used in longitudinal studies conducted by the\npharmaceutical companies to evaluate the effect of anti-fibrotic drugs used to\ntreat patients within the initial stages of fibrosis .

It is hypothesized\nthat such molecules may be useful across all temperatures eliminating cellular\ndestruction due to equilibration cytotoxicity before and after\ncryopreservation. By probing the biochemical space using solvation-associated\nmolecular topology and partition-distribution measures we developed an analytic\nformalism for ice crystal inhibition. By probing the union between a heat-shock\nprotein cluster and an anti-freeze glycoprotein cluster, the model development\nprocess generated distinct regions of interest for anti-freeze glycoprotein and\nproved robust across different classes of proteins. These results confirm that\nthere is a chemical space within which efficacious Ice Crystal Inhibitor\nmolecular libraries can be constructed. These spaces contain latent projections\ndrawn from solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding capacity and molecular\ngeometry. They also showed that molecular design can be a useful tool in the\ndevelopment of new-age cryoactive matrices to enable the smooth transition\nacross culture, preservation and expansion. These chemical spaces provide low\ncytotoxicity since such amphipathic molecules occupy a continuum between\nsolubizing and membrane stabilizing regions as shown by the free energy of\ntranslocation calculations. These biochemical design spaces are fundamentally\nthe solution to efficient scale-up and deployment of cell therapies.\nConsequently, this article proposes the use of a molecular knowledge-mining\napproach in the development of a class of non-cytotoxic cryoprotective agents\nin the class of Ice Crystal Inhibitor compatible with continuous cryothermic\nand normothermic cell storage and expansion.\n",

Animal-infrastructure interactions vary across focal\nspecies and regions, underlining the need to study the animal-outage\nrelationship in more species and diverse systems. Animal activity has been used\nas an indicator of reliability in the electrical grid system and to describe\ntemporal patterns in AROs. However, these ARO models have been limited by a\nlack of available estimates of species activity, instead approximating activity\nbased on seasonal and weather patterns in animal-related outage records and\ncharacteristics of broad taxonomic groups, e.g., squirrels. We highlight\npublicly available resources to fill the ecological data gap that is limiting\njoint analyses between ecology and energy sectors. Species distribution models\n(SDMs), a common technique to model the distribution of a species across\ngeographic space and time, paired with data sourced from eBird, a community\nscience database for bird observations, provided us with species-specific\nestimates of activity to model spatio-temporal patterns of AROs. These\nflexible, species-specific estimates can allow future animal-indicators of grid\nreliability to be investigated in more diverse regions and ecological\ncommunities, providing a better understanding of the variation that exists in\nanimal-outage relationship. AROs were best modeled by accounting for multiple\noutage-prone species activity patterns and their unique relationships with\nseasonality and habitat availability. Different species were important for\nmodeling outages in different landscapes and seasons depending on their\ndistribution and migration behavior. We recommend that future models of AROs\ninclude species-specific activity data that account for the diverse spectrum of\nspatio-temporal activity patterns that outage-prone animals exhibit.\n",

Earlier\nwork, from which the previous discussion is entirely independent, explains\nthese phenomena from general principles of free energy, namely, the\nmetastability of the glycoprotein. The conclusions therefore likely hold more\ngenerally as principles in virology.\n",

Omicron is the fifth variant of\nconcern (VOC), which comprises more than 10 mutations in the receptor-binding\ndomain (RBD) of the spike protein. However, the lack of extensive research\nregarding Omicron has raised the need to establish correlations to understand\nthis variant by structural comparisons. Here, we evaluate, correlate, and\ncompare its genomic sequences through an immunoinformatic approach with wild\nand mutant RBD forms of the spike protein to understand its epidemiological\ncharacteristics and responses towards existing drugs for better patient\nmanagement. Our computational analyses provided insights into infectious and\npathogenic trails of the Omicron variant. In addition, while the analysis\nrepresented South Africa's Omicron variant being similar to the\nhighly-infectious B.1.620 variant, mutations within the prominent proteins are\nhypothesized to alter its pathogenicity. Moreover, docking evaluations revealed\nsignificant differences in binding affinity with human receptors, ACE2 and\nNRP1. Owing to its characteristics of rendering existing treatments\nineffective, we evaluated the drug efficacy against their target protein\nencoded in the Omicron through molecular docking approach. Most of the tested\ndrugs were proven to be effective.

Other models\nhave examined the efficacy of various policy measures that have been adopted\n(including the unparalleled use of \"lockdowns\") to contain and combat the\ndisease. This multiplicity of models may have led to bewilderment in many\nquarters about the true capabilities and utility of mathematical modeling. Here\nwe provide a brief guide to epidemiological modeling, focusing on how it has\nemerged as a tool for informed public-health policy-making and has in turn,\ninfluenced the design of interventions aimed at preventing disease outbreaks\nfrom turning into raging epidemics. We show that the diversity of models is\nsomewhat illusory, as the bulk of them are rooted in the compartmental modeling\nframework that we describe here.

It\nis necessary to store its seeds as backup resources. Cryopreservation is the\nreliable, cost-effective method for long-term preservation of botanical genetic\nbanks, especially for recalcitrant plants. In this study, we demonstrated that\ndue to unable to tolerate desiccation and low-temperature, N. caerulea is\nrecalcitrant. Since viability was lost before 6 months storage, N. caerulea\nseeds were not appropriate to long-term store by traditional storage method.\nThe only way to long-term store N. caerulea seeds is cryopreservation. However,\nPlant Vitrification Solution 3 (PVS3; 50% w/v sucrose, 50% w/v glycerol), a\ncommonly used plant vitrification solution, was ineffective on N. caerulea\nseeds cryopreservation. The maximum survival rate of cryopreserved seeds\ntreated by PVS3 was only 23%. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) accumulation within seeds was the reason to cause inefficiency of\nPVS3 treated seeds cryopreservation. We developed a new plant vitrification\nsolution (PVS+), by adding glutathione (GSH) into PVS3. PVS+ rescued the\ninefficiency by decreasing ROS accumulation and elevated survival rate of\ncryopreserved seeds to 97%. Our results showed some inefficiencies of plant\ntissue cryopreservation may be caused by ROS-induced oxidative stress.\nAntioxidants can reduce ROS-induced oxidative stress and improve seeds survival\nafter cryopreservation. In conclusion, N. caerulea seeds were identified as\nrecalcitrant and successfully cryopreserved. Suppressing ROS accumulation\nduring cryopreservation may be a potential strategy to improve survival rate of\nrecalcitrant seeds after cryopreservation.\n",

Many countries worldwide decided to impose local\nlockdowns in order to reduce person-to-person interactions, masks became\nobligatory especially in closed spaces, and there was a general requirement for\nsocial distance. However, the most efficient method to reduce continuing\nspreading of infection among the population, and in the meantime maintain a\nregular daily life, is early detection of infected contagious people. Up to\nnow, the most reliable method for SARS-CoV-2 detection is reverse-transcriptase\nPCR test (RT-PCR). It is possible to detect the virus even if there is only one\nRNA strand in the sample, and run hundreds of samples simultaneously. This\nmethod has a few disadvantages, such as high cost, is time consuming, the need\nfor medical laboratories and skilled staff to perform the test, and the major\nflaw: the lack of appropriate number of available tests. The latterly prominent\nOmicron variant (B.1.1.529) and its derivatives have caused a tremendous\nincrease in the number of infected people due to its enhanced transmissibility.\nThis all emphasizes the high demand for easy-to-use, cheap and available\ndetection tests.\n",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies such as\nmRNA vaccines have received attention due to their novelty and successes.\nHowever, more traditional vaccine development platforms have also yielded\nimportant tools in the worldwide fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A variety\nof approaches have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines that are now\nauthorized for use in countries around the world. In this review, we highlight\nstrategies that focus on the viral capsid and outwards, rather than on the\nnucleic acids inside. These approaches fall into two broad categories:\nwhole-virus vaccines and subunit vaccines. Whole-virus vaccines use the virus\nitself, either in an inactivated or attenuated state. Subunit vaccines contain\ninstead an isolated, immunogenic component of the virus. Here, we highlight\nvaccine candidates that apply these approaches against SARS-CoV-2 in different\nways. In a companion manuscript, we review the more recent and novel\ndevelopment of nucleic-acid based vaccine technologies. We further consider the\nrole that these COVID-19 vaccine development programs have played in\nprophylaxis at the global scale. Well-established vaccine technologies have\nproved especially important to making vaccines accessible in low- and\nmiddle-income countries. Vaccine development programs that use established\nplatforms have been undertaken in a much wider range of countries than those\nusing nucleic-acid-based technologies, which have been led by wealthy Western\ncountries. Therefore, these vaccine platforms, though less novel from a\nbiotechnological standpoint, have proven to be extremely important to the\nmanagement of SARS-CoV-2.\n",

It\nhas been showed that insects may use gravitational fields to travel (Dreyer et\nal 2018) and we may ask whether the use of gravitational fields is enough to\nsecure the arrival of an individual to a relatively narrow spot thousands of\nkilometers away, as it is the case for example of monarch butterflies, which\nmay travel 4,500 km to land in Mexico within an area of about 1/8 the size of\nLong Island. Here we show that if individuals budget a fraction of time to seek\nthe target and the rest to maintain aggregation, the chances of landing within\na narrow spot even under a weak signal are increased. Our model exhibits the\nexistence of an equilibrium, the tradeoff that comes from maintaining group\nsize, aggregation, and targeting. Whenever this balance is broken, the\npopulation may behave erratically. If this strategic balance between targeting\nand aggregation is prevalent then the possibility of destabilizing may be used\nto control or regulate the spread of undesirable organisms that navigate under\nthis balancing set of mechanisms.\n",

Methods: Based on data of\n35 patients of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG and 3 scRNA-seq CG samples, we conduct\nanalysis with transcriptomics datasets and algorithms, to discover biomarkers\nfor Cold/Hot ZHENG CG. And we collected 25 formulae (with traditional effects\nrelated to Cold/Hot ZHENG) for CG and corresponding 89 Cold/Hot herbs\n(including Warm/Cool herbs) to discover features and construct target networks\nof Cold/Hot herbs on the basis of network target and enrichment analysis.\nResults: Biomarkers of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG represented by CCL2 and LEP suggested\nthat Hot ZHENG CG might be characterized by over-inflammation and exuberant\nmetabolism, and Cold ZHENG CG showed a trend of suppression in immune\nregulation and energy metabolism. And biomarkers of Cold/Hot ZHENG showed also\nsignificant changes in the progression of gastric cancer. And biomarkers and\npathways of Hot herbs intend to regulate immune responses and energy\nmetabolism, while those of Cold herbs were likely to participate in\nanti-inflammation effect. Conclusion: In this study, we found that the\nbiomarkers and mechanism of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG and those of Cold/Hot herbs were\nclosely related to the regulation of immune and metabolisms. These findings may\nreflect the mechanism, build bridges between multiple views of Cold/Hot ZHENG\nand Cold/Hot herbs, and provide a research paradigm for further achieving\nprecision TCM.\n",

Molecular studies have revealed that tumors are extremely\nheterogeneous in nature, leading to the complexity of cancer development, which\nis ultimately linked to its genetic machinery. It would require effective\ntargeting of dysregulated molecular mechanisms involving growth factors,\nregulatory proteins, cell adhesion molecules, and molecules of immune system\nmainly driven by alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that may\nvary among different cancer types. Importantly, patients with the same type of\ncancer respond differently to available cancer treatments, indicating the need\nfor patient-specific treatment options. Thus, in-depth genomic studies of\npatients' tumors are needed to fully understand the determinants of cancer\ninitiation and progression for effective targeted therapy.

The analysis is based on a new epidemiological cohort model that\nrepresents testing, vaccination and contact restrictions by time-varying rates\nof detection, vaccination and contacts, respectively.\n  Only the effectiveness of different vaccines is taken from the literature.\nAll other parameters are automatically identified in such a way that the\nsimulated and the published incidences and death rates match. Among these\nparameters are incubation time, mean duration of the infectious phase,\nmortality rate, as well as two contact rates and one detection rate per week.\n  Note that we can reconstruct such a high number of parameters only because we\nassume that the weekly wave patterns in new infections follow real infection\ndynamics, periodically driven by high contact rates on weekdays and lower ones\non weekends. Usually, people assume that the weekly wave patterns are just\nreporting artefacts and that weekly mean values are the finest usable data.\n  One focus of the paper is to quantify the increase in detection rate due to\nthe introduction of rapid testing in schools. For this purpose, we compare\nfederal states that differ in the start of school tests and Easter holidays.\nThere is a clear temporal correlation with the identified detection rates.\n  Finally, we compare the effect of the individual non-pharmaceutical measures\nby replacing one by one the fitted rates of detection, vaccination and contacts\nby neutral ones.

Results examined that oxygen supply promoted the\nthiosulfate-Sproduced/TdS-Sproduced ratio from 4% to 24-26%, demonstrated that\nsulfate and microbial activities were critical for thiosulfate production, and\nindicated that oxygen induces thiosulfate formation through two pathways: 1)\ndirect sulfide oxidation, and 2) indirect sulfide oxidation, sulfide is first\noxidized to S0 (dominant) which then reacts with sulfite derived from\noxygen-regulated biological sulfate reduction.

This produced different\nLRs but the analyst would be left deciding what to do with these options. This\ncannot be based on the LRs but should be based on whether any movement in the\nAT adds reliable or unreliable data. This is how most laboratories set their AT\nin the first place. Hence it is pointless, and potentially dangerous, to\nexperimentally vary the AT in casework. The profile is low level and shows at\nmost three peaks.

An important\nclass of such systems are excitable media, including neural and cardiac\ntissues. In extended excitable media, wave breaks can form rotating patterns\nand turbulence. However, the onset, sustaining and elimination of such complex\npatterns is currently incompletely understood. The classical theory of phase\nsingularities in excitable media was recently challenged, as extended lines of\nconduction block were identified as phase discontinuities. Here, we provide a\ntheoretical framework that captures the rich dynamics in excitable systems in\nterms of three quasiparticles: heads, tails, and pivots. We propose to call\nthese quasiparticles `cardions'. In simulations and experiments, we show that\nthese basic building blocks combine into at least four different bound states.\nBy representing their interactions similarly to Feynman diagrams in physics,\nthe creation and annihilation of vortex pairs are shown to be sequences of\ndynamical creation, annihilation, and recombination of the identified\nquasiparticles. We draw such diagrams for numerical simulations, as well as\noptical voltage mapping experiments performed on cultured human atrial myocytes\n(hiAMs). Our results provide a new, unified language for a more detailed\ntheory, analysis, and mechanistic insights of dynamical transitions in\nexcitation patterns.\n",

First of all,The\nSNP database hosted by NCBI was used to extract some principal data. The\nassociation of Rb1 to Other genes were analyzed by GeneMANIA. Ten different\ncomputational tools, i.eSIFT,Polyphen-2, I-Mutant 3.0,PROVEAN, SNAP2, PHD-SNP,\nPMut, SNPs&GO were used for the screening of damaging SNP for the estimation of\nconserved regions of amino acids Consurf Server was used for the evaluation of\nthe structural stability of both native and mutant proteins, Project Hope was\nused to examine the structural effects of mutant protein.GeneMANIA predicted\nthat RB1 Gene was expected to have a strong association with 20 other genes\ni.e. CCND1 and RBP2 etc. As per data retrieved from dbSNP hosted by NCBI,the\nRb1 gene probed in this study carried a total of 36,358 SNPs. 345 were found in\n3'UTR, 65 in 5'UTR, and 34,543 were found in the intron region. 844 were coding\nSNPs, and out of 844, 199 were synonymous And 450 were non-synonymous,\nincluding 425 missense, five nonsense, and 20 frameshift mutations. And\nremaining all are other types of SNPs. We took 425 missense SNPs for our\ninvestigation. A total of 17 mutations i.e. D332G, R445Q, E492V, P515T, W516G,\nV531G, E533K, E539K, M558R,W563G, L657Q, A658T, R661Q, D697H, D697E, P796L and\nR798W were predicted to have Damaging effects on structure and function of Rb1\nprotein..\n",

Despite the improvements in imaging techniques in the last decade,\nall parts of the tumor are not visible in these images, due to having a\nthreshold of detection often lower than most of the tumor. Method: We simulated\na brain domain to model heterogeneous growth plus gross total resection\nfollowing concurrent chemo- and radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy\nusing temozolomide for a patient, diagnosed with glioblastoma, for different\nradiobiological alpha parameter as high, medium, and low sensitivity. The\nextent of difference in the result of treatment, area of the tumor, and\nsurvival time relating to those sensitivity parameters were shown. Moreover,\nbased on the threshold of detection of MRI (T1Gd), the area of the tumor\nvisible to this imaging technique was simulated. Furthermore, the extent of\ndifference in the result of treatment for both conventional and\nhyperfractionated radiotherapy was investigated. Conclusion: The survival time\nof patient was increased by 2 months and more than 3 months at the lowest and\nhighest sensitivity of radiation therapy, respectively.The result showed\nhyperfractionated radiotherapy was more effective than conventional\nradiotherapy in reducing the concentration of cancerous cells,as\nhyperfractionated method allows administration of higher total dose.\n",

This experiment observed bananas, bread, milk, eggs,\nand leafy greens over a period of time using characteristics specific to the\nfood to quantify food spoilage. It was shown that the actual time until\nspoilage for all foods was longer than that of the best by date and that\nsensory observations proved to be a more accurate factor in determining\nspoilage. From this data, a machine learning algorithm was trained to predict\nif food was spoiled or not, in addition to the number of days until spoilage.\nThis was presented to the consumer as an app, where the user can track foods\nand are reminded to check on them to prevent wastage. In addition, the\nexperimental procedures were incorporated into a test kit for the consumer to\ntake instructed observations to assess the spoilage of their food, which are\nthen entered into the app to improve the algorithm.

The biological dynamics of this essentially\nempirical allometric equation, however, have yet to be properly addressed in\ncell level. In order to fill the gap between biological process in cell level\nand allometric scaling in metabolic ecology, we simply assumed a cell\nbipartition without limitation, and then exponential cells increased during\ntheir lifetime. Two synchronous exponential increasing could generate a\npower-law scaling between body mass and an organ's weight. And the power-law\nscaling between body mass and metabolic rate may also be obtained by\nsubstituting an organ's weight with the weight of erythrocytes. Based on the\nsame assumption, the dynamic of cell proliferation reveal a complex exponential\nscaling between body mass and longevity rather than the previously reported\npower-law scaling. In other words, there is a quadratic relationship between\nlongevity and logarithmic form of body mass. In these relationships, all\nparameters can be explained by indices in cell division and embryo.\n",

The aim of this paper is to\nargue that this is the main cause of over-diagnosis and over-treatment.\nMethods: Illustrative data were taken from a randomised control trial (RCT)\nthat compared the frequency of nephropathy within 2 years in those on treatment\nwith an angiotensin receptor blocker and a control and on patients in whom the\nnumerical value of the albumin excretion rate (AER) was available on all\npatients before they are randomised. Results: When the RCT results were divided\ninto AER ranges, a negligible proportion developed nephropathy within 2 years\nand benefited from treatment in the range 20 to 40mcg/min in which 36% of\ncurrently treated patients fall (and are thus over-diagnosed and overtreated).\nAbove an AER of 40mcg/min, there was a gradual increase in proportions with\nnephropathy in each range, with fewer developing nephropathy in each range on\nirbesartan 150mg daily than on control and fewer still developing nephropathy\non 300mg daily. Interpretation: When logistic regression functions were fitted\nto the data and calibrated, curves were created that allowed outcome\nprobabilities and absolute risk reductions to be estimated for use in shared\ndecision making (illustrated by application to an example patient). This could\navoid much overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Conclusion: Careful attention to\ndisease severity by interpreting each numerical diagnostic result provides\nbetter application of the principles of diagnosis and treatment decisions that\ncan prevent over-diagnosis and over-treatment.\n",

The color and taste properties of saffron\nare linked to carotenoid elements including cis- and trans-crocin, picrocrocin,\nand safranal. In the research carried out, we dedicated our attention to the\ngene CsZCD, an important player in the formation of apocarotenoids. Through the\napplication of real-time polymerase chain reaction to RNA purified from saffron\nstigmas at various growth phases, it was determined that the peak expression of\nthe CsZCD gene coincided with the red stage, which is associated with the\nhighest concentration of apocarotenoids. The data showed a 2.69-fold\nenhancement in CsZCD gene expression during the red phase, whereas a 0.90-fold\nand 0.69-fold reduction was noted at the stages characterized by orange and\nyellow hues, respectively. A noteworthy observation was that CsZCD's expression\nwas three times that of the CsTUB gene. Additionally, relative to CsTUB, CsLYC\ndisplayed 0.7-fold and 0.3-times expression. Our investigation provides insight\ninto the governance of CsZCD during stigma maturation and its possible\ninfluence on the fluctuation in apocarotenoid content. These discoveries carry\nsignificance for the industrial production of saffron spice and underscore the\nimportance of additional studies on pivotal genes participating in the\nsynthesis of apocarotenoids.\n",

Hence, analyses of fruit quality traits of\nmini watermelon are crucial to develop improved cultivars with enhanced\nnutritional compositions, consumer-preferred traits and extended storage life.\nIn this context, fruit morphological and nutritional attributes of five mini\nwatermelon genotypes namely BARI watermelon 1 (W1), BARI watermelon 2 (W2),\nL-32468 (W3), L-32236 (W4) and L-32394 (W5) were evaluated to appraise\npromising genotypes with better fruit quality. The evaluated genotypes\nexpressed different levels of diversity for fruit physical qualitative traits\nincluding differences in shape, rind and flesh color and texture. The study\nalso revealed significant variability among the genotypes regarding all\nobserved fruit morphological and nutritional aspects as well as bioactive\ncompounds. Among the studied genotypes, W1 stood out with the highest TSS as\nwell as rind vitamin C and total phenolic content accompanied by higher fruit\nweight and thick rind. On the other hand, W3 genotype was featured with higher\namount of \\b{eta} carotene, total phenolic and flavonoid content in its flesh\nalong with rind enriched with \\b{eta} carotene and minerals. However,\ncomparatively higher amount of sugar and total flavonoid content was recorded\nin the rind of W5 genotype. Therefore, W1 and W3 could be exploited for table\npurpose and using in breeding program to develop mini watermelon cultivars with\nmore attractive fruits in terms of quality acceptance and nutritional value in\nBangladesh. Furthermore, rind of BARI watermelon 1 and L-32394 could be\nconsidered as the potential cheap source of bioactive compounds to be used for\ndietary and industrial purpose which would decrease the solid waste in the\nenvironment.\n",

        "summary": "  Human behavior training in improvisational theater has shown extensive\nbehavioral and health benefits. Improved empathy measures in medical students,\nimproved behavior outcome in patients with autism and a reduced recidivism rate\nare among the many benefits attributed to improvisational theater training.\nHowever, measuring tangible outcomes of changed behavior is challenging and\nusually requires multiple sessions or months of training. One of the principal\ntenets of improvisational theater is to actively listen and collaboratively\nallow a scene partner to talk and provide equal input as needed. Here we\nmeasured human speech epochs and asked if a month of weekly improvisational\ntheater training would reflect in speech epoch assays. We found a significant\ndecrease in speech epoch durations after one month of weekly training. There\nwas no change in epoch durations on the same day, suggesting it to be a stable\nparameter over a day, but amenable to modulation over a month of training. The\noverall rhythm of speech epochs remained unchanged but durations of discrete\nlow frequency speech volleys increased. Moreover, training improved regularity\nof adjacent speech epoch durations, suggesting a better sharing of speaking\nfocus by matching speech time to the previous speech epoch duration. Our assay\nprovides a proof-of-concept study of empathy-relevant tractable speech epoch\nparameters associated with changes in a month after human behavior training.\n",

The endosymbiotic hypothesis that chloroplasts, mitochondria and\nnuclei descend from the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium, bacterium and\narchaebacterium respectively is dominant yet uncompelling, while our discovery\nof de novo organelle biogenesis in the cyanobacterium TDX16 that had acquired\nthe genome of its green algal host Haematococcus pluvialis overturns this\nhypothesis. In light of organelle biogenesis in the cyanobacterium TDX16 in\ncombination with the relevant cellular and molecular evidence, we propose\ngenome hybridization hypothesis (GHH) that the origin of organelles and origin\nof eukaryotes as well as the diversification of organelles and speciation of\neukaryotes are unified and achieved by genome hybridization: the endosymbiotic\ncyanobacteria or bacteria obtain genomes of their archaebacterial or eukaryotic\nhosts and hybridize with their own ones resulting in expanded genomes\ncontaining a mixture of hybrid prokaryotic genes and eukaryotic genes, and thus\nthe cyanobacteria or bacteria have to compartmentalize to accommodate different\ngenes for specialized function of photosynthesis (chloroplast), respiration\n(mitochondrion) and DNA preservation (nucleus), and consequently turn into\nphotosynthetic or heterotrophic eukaryotes. Accordingly, eukaryotes and their\norganelles are of multiple origin, while the formation of cancer cells is the\nspeciation of eukaryotes as cancer cells are new species of unicellular\neukaryotes arising from bacteria.

On the other hand, hardwood cuttings are stored at low\ntemperature in order to improve rooting ability via reducing rooting inhibitors\nthat occur in dormant cuttings which were taken during dormant seasons (late\nfall or early winter). So, declining in rooting inhibitors has been observed in\nthe hardwood cuttings of deciduous trees and Vitis spp which were subjected to\nlow temperature for around 2-6 months. Consequently, rooting was improved in\nthese species. Also, cold storage of cuttings of some coniferous trees\nincreased rooting at a high rate.

The immune system, which has a central\nrole in many diseases, is highly heterogeneous between individuals, and thus\nposes a major challenge for this technology. If medical digital twins are to\nfaithfully capture the characteristics of a patient's immune system, we need to\nanswer many questions, such as: What do we need to know about the immune system\nto build mathematical models that reflect features of an individual? What data\ndo we need to collect across the different scales of immune system action? What\nare the right modeling paradigms to properly capture immune system complexity?\nIn February 2023, an international group of experts convened in Lake Nona, FL\nfor two days to discuss these and other questions related to digital twins of\nthe immune system. The group consisted of clinicians, immunologists,\nbiologists, and mathematical modelers, representative of the interdisciplinary\nnature of medical digital twin development. A video recording of the entire\nevent is available. This paper presents a synopsis of the discussions, brief\ndescriptions of ongoing digital twin projects at different stages of progress.\nIt also proposes a 5-year action plan for further developing this technology.\nThe main recommendations are to identify and pursue a small number of promising\nuse cases, to develop stimulation-specific assays of immune function in a\nclinical setting, and to develop a database of existing computational immune\nmodels, as well as advanced modeling technology and infrastructure.\n",

MRD assays must detect tumor when\nimaging cannot and, as such, require very high sensitivity to detect the low\nlevels of ctDNA found after curative intent therapy. The minimum threshold is\n0.01% Tumour Fraction but current methods like Archer and Signatera are limited\nby detection sensitivity resulting in some patients receiving a false negative\ncall thereby missing out on earlier therapeutic intervention. Multiple vendors\nare increasing the number of somatic variants tracked in tumour-informed and\npersonalized NGS assays, from tens to thousands of variants. Most recently,\nassays using other biological features of ctDNA, e.g methylation or\nfragmentome, have been developed at the LOD required for clinical utility.\nThese uniformed, or tumour-naive and non-personalised assays may be more\neasily, and therefore more rapidly, adopted in the clinic. However, this rapid\ndevelopment in MRD assay technology results in significant challenges in\nbenchmarking these new technologies for use in clinical trials. This is further\ncomplicated by the fact that previous reference materials have focused on\nsomatic variants, and do not retain all of the epigenomic features assessed by\nnewer technologies.

These women reported decreased access to\nhealthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to\nbudget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was\nless evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The\npandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most\nvulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support\nand public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic's\neconomic repercussions have indirectly impaired women's nutritional health,\nespecially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This highlights the\nnecessity for tailored nutritional interventions and economic policies focused\non safeguarding women's health.\n",

However, the vast majority of studies to\ndate have focused, either explicitly or implicitly, on spatial decisions (e.g.,\npotential nest sites, food patches, or migration directions). We highlight the\nequally important, but severely understudied, realm of temporal collective\ndecision-making, i.e., decisions about when to perform an action. We argue that\ntemporal collective decision making is likely to differ from spatial decision\nmaking in several crucial ways and probably involves different mechanisms,\nmodel predictions, and experimental outcomes. We anticipate that research\nfocused on temporal decisions should lead to a radically expanded understanding\nof the adaptiveness and constraints of living in groups.\n",

The codon-anticodon\ninteraction is written as a spin-spin plus a z-spin term in the formalism of\nthe crystal basis model. From general considerations, in particular from the\nchoice of the signs and some constraints on the parameters defining the\ninteraction, we are able to explain most of the observed data.\n",

The thallus of brown seaweeds of the order\nLaminariales (kelps) is morphologically complex but there is limited\ninformation about the variation in metal accumulation between the different\nparts, which might result in erroneous conclusions being drawn if not accounted\nfor in the biomonitoring protocol. To assess patterns of individual metals in\nthe differentiated parts of the thallus (blade, stipe, holdfast),\nconcentrations of a wide range of essential and non-essential metals (Fe, Cr,\nCu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni and Al) were measured in the kelp Lessonia trabeculata.\nSeaweeds were collected from three sampling stations located at 5, 30 and 60 m\nfrom an illegal sewage outfall close to Ventanas, Chile and from a pristine\nlocation at Faro Curaumilla. For the majority of metals the highest\nconcentrations in bottom sediment and seaweed samples were found at the site\nclosest to the outfall, with concentrations decreasing with distance from the\noutfall and at control stations; the exception was Cd, concentrations of which\nwere higher at control stations. The patterns of metal concentrations in\ndifferent thallus parts were metal specific and independent of sampling\nstation. These results and the available literature suggest that biomonitoring\nof metals using seaweeds must take account of differences in the accumulation\nof metals in thallus parts of complex seaweeds\n",

For example,\npleasant weather may mean that people spend more time outside doing physical\nactivity and exposed to the weather, leading to more (or less) pain, and poor\nweather or severe pain may keep people inside, sedentary, and not exposed to\nthe weather. We conducted a smartphone study where participants with chronic\npain reported daily pain severity, as well as time spent outside. We address\nthe relationship between four weather variables (temperature, dewpoint\ntemperature, pressure, and wind speed) and pain by proposing a three-step\napproach to untangle their effects: (i) propose a set of plausible directed\nacyclic graphs (also known as DAGs) that account for potential roles of time\nspent outside (e.g., collider, effect modifier, mediator), (ii) analyze the\ncompatibility of the observed data with the assumed model, and (iii) identify\nthe most plausible model by combining evidence from the observed data and\ndomain-specific knowledge. We found that the data do not support time spent\noutside as a collider or mediator of the relationship between weather variables\nand pain. On the other hand, time spent outside modifies the effect between\ntemperature and pain, as well as wind speed and pain, with the effect being\nabsent on days that participants spent inside and present if they spent some or\nall of the day outside.

Methods and\nStudy Design: We conducted a study of adult septic patients in Intensive Care\nUnit (ICU), collecting 47 indicators for 14 days. After data cleaning and\npreprocessing, we used stats to explore energy delivery in deceased and\nsurviving patients. We filtered out nutrition-related features and divided the\ndata into three metabolic phases: acute early, acute late, and rehabilitation.\nModels were built using data before September 2020 and validated on the rest.\nWe then established optimal energy target models for each phase using deep\nlearning. Results: A total of 277 patients and 3115 data were included in this\nstudy. The models indicated that the optimal energy targets in the three phases\nwere 900kcal/d, 2300kcal/d, and 2000kcal/d, respectively. Excessive energy\nintake increased mortality rapidly in the early period of the acute phase.\nInsufficient energy in the late period of the acute phase significantly raised\nthe mortality of septic patients. For the rehabilitation phase, too much or too\nlittle energy delivery both associated with high mortality. Conclusion: Our\nstudy established time-series prediction models for septic patients to optimize\nenergy delivery in the ICU. This approach indicated the feasibility of\ndeveloping nutritional tools for critically ill patients. We recommended\npermissive underfeeding only in the early acute phase. Later, increased energy\nintake may improve survival and settle energy debts caused by underfeeding.\n",

Its modular nature and the reusability of standardized parts allow\nrapid construction of transcription units and multi-gene constructs.\nImportantly, its modular structure makes it compatible with laboratory\nautomation, allowing for systematic and highly complex DNA assembly. Golden\nGate cloning relies on Type IIS enzymes that cleave an adjacent undefined\nsequence motif at a defined distance from the directed enzyme recognition\nmotif. This feature has been used to define hierarchical Golden Gate assembly\nstandards with defined overhangs (\"fusion sites\") for defined part libraries.\nThe simplest Golden Gate standard would consist of three part libraries, namely\npromoter, coding and terminator sequences, respectively. Each library would\nhave defined fusion sites, allowing a hierarchical Golden Gate assembly to\ngenerate transcription units. Typically, Type IIS enzymes are used, which\ngenerate four nucleotide overhangs. This results in small scar sequences in\nhierarchical DNA assemblies, which can affect the functionality of\ntranscription units. However, there are enzymes that generate three nucleotide\noverhangs, such as SapI. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol on how to use\nSapI to assemble transcription units using the start and stop codon for\nscarless transcription unit assembly. The protocol also provides guidance on\nhow to perform multi-gene Golden Gate assemblies with the resulting\ntranscription units using the Modular Cloning standard.

Phage therapy has arisen as a favorable option to conventional\nantibiotics by reducing the multinational problem of increasing antibacterial\nresistance. These virulent viruses particularly prey on and contaminate\nbacterial strains and aid in fighting bacterial diseases. Researchers are\nperforming various clinical trials on the bacteriophage to tackle pathogenic\nbacterial infections, varying from typical illnesses to highly invulnerable\nbiofilms that cannot be treated with antibiotics. The primary experiments\ndemonstrated that phage therapy has fewer consequences than traditional\nantimicrobial drugs. It is safer to use and show results within a few days.\nAlthough phage therapy has a wide range of promising results, but it also\nencounters diverse obstacles. One is that they are host-specific and can merely\nbe used for personalized therapy. As thousands of bacteria can cause disease,\nclinicians have to construct a library of phage viruses. For successful\ntreatment, an analysis of versatility, stability, and immune interference\nrelated to bacteriophage is necessary. Phage therapy is an excellent substitute\nfor antibiotics as it illustrates a living base for the treatment of infections\nand it is climate-friendly. It only targets the pathogenic cells and has less\ninfluence on the normal microbiota. Regardless of the challenges and problems,\nphage therapy is approved as a beneficial approach to combating contagious\ninfections.\n",

        "summary": "  Multimodal neuroimaging grants a powerful in vivo window into the structure\nand function of the human brain. Recent methodological and conceptual advances\nhave enabled investigations of the interplay between large-scale spatial\ntrends, or gradients, in brain structure and function, offering a framework to\nunify principles of brain organization across multiple scales. Strong community\nenthusiasm for these techniques has been instrumental in their widespread\nadoption and implementation to answer key questions in neuroscience. Following\na brief review of current literature on this framework, this perspective paper\nwill highlight how pragmatic steps aiming to make gradient methods more\naccessible to the community propelled these techniques to the forefront of\nneuroscientific inquiry. More specifically, we will emphasize how interest for\ngradient methods was catalyzed by data sharing, open-source software\ndevelopment, as well as the organization of dedicated workshops led by a\ndiverse team of early career researchers. To this end, we argue that the\ngrowing excitement for brain gradients is the result of coordinated and\nconsistent efforts to build an inclusive community and can serve as a case in\npoint for future innovations and conceptual advances in neuroinformatics. We\nclose this perspective paper by discussing challenges for the continuous\nrefinement of neuroscientific theory, methodological innovation, and real-world\ntranslation to maintain our collective progress towards integrated models of\nbrain organization.\n",

Although\ngenetic ancestry plays a significant role in shaping the genetic landscape\nunderlying disease risk in humans, the overall risk of a disease is caused by a\ncomplex combination of environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors. When\nusing EHR-linked biobanks to interrogate underlying disease etiology, it is\nalso important to be aware of how the biases associated with commonly used\ndescent-associated concepts such as race and ethnicity can propagate to\ndownstream analyses.

Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and,\nimmunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are\nlaborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and\ncontamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising\nalternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and\ndemonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for\ndisease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical\nspectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial\nphases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and\ncommercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental\nworking principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and\nlimitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic\nimaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in\ncitrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of\noptical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field\nmeasurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf\nspectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including\nfuture insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover,\nthe role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools\nfor spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus\nleaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging\ncompositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant\nleaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development\nand commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid\nand early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.\n",

        "summary": "  Living systems, from single cells to higher vertebrates, receive a continuous\nstream of non-stationary inputs that they sense, e.g., via cell surface\nreceptors or sensory organs. Integrating these time-varying, multi-sensory, and\noften noisy information with memory using complex molecular or neuronal\nnetworks, they generate a variety of responses beyond simple stimulus-response\nassociation, including avoidance behavior, life-long-learning or social\ninteractions. In a broad sense, these processes can be understood as a type of\nbiological computation. Taking as a basis generic features of biological\ncomputations, such as real-time responsiveness or robustness and flexibility of\nthe computation, we highlight the limitations of the current attractor-based\nframework for understanding computations in biological systems. We argue that\nframeworks based on transient dynamics away from attractors are better suited\nfor the description of computations performed by neuronal and signaling\nnetworks. In particular, we discuss how quasi-stable transient dynamics from\nghost states that emerge at criticality have a promising potential for\ndeveloping an integrated framework of computations, that can help us understand\nhow living system actively process information and learn from their\ncontinuously changing environment.\n",

People with MS want\nevidence-based MS-specific information to help them make healthy dietary\nchanges, and we co-designed an asynchronous, online nutrition education program\n(Eating Well with MS) with the MS community. Our aim was to determine the\nfeasibility of Eating Well with MS. Methods: We used a single-arm pre-post\ndesign. The feasibility trial was a nine-week intervention with adults with\nconfirmed MS. Feasibility outcomes: 1) demand (recruitment); 2) practicality\n(completion); 3) acceptability (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory:\ninterest/enjoyment and value/usefulness subscales); and 4) limited efficacy\ntesting (Diet Habits Questionnaire (DHQ); Critical Nutrition Literacy Tool\n(CNLT); Food Literacy Behaviour Checklist (FLBC)). Results: The recruitment\ntarget (n=70) was reached. 87% completed at least one module and 57% completed\nthe full program (five modules). The median interest/enjoyment rating was 5 out\nof 7 and median value/usefulness rating was 6 out of 7 (where 7 = very true).\nCompared to pre-program, participants who completed any of the program had\nstatistically significantly improved DHQ, CNLT, and FLBC scores. Conclusion:\nEating Well with MS was well received by the MS community and improved their\ndietary behaviours; demonstrating feasibility. Our findings support the use of\nco-design methods when developing resources to improve dietary behaviours.\n",

There is growing evidence to support the role of diet\nin reducing some of the symptoms and disease progression in MS, and we\npreviously developed and tested the feasibility of a digital nutrition\neducation program for people with MS. Objective The aim of this study was to\nexplore factors that influenced engagement in the digital nutrition education\nprogram, including features influencing capability, opportunity, and motivation\nto change their dietary behaviours. Methods Semi-structured interviews were\nconducted with people who MS who completed some or all of the program, until\ndata saturation was reached. Interviews were analysed inductively using\nthematic analysis. Themes were deductively mapped against the COM-B behaviour\nchange model. Results 16 interviews were conducted with participants who\ncompleted all (n=10) or some of the program (n=6). Four themes emerged: 1)\nAcquiring and validating nutrition knowledge; 2) Influence of time and social\nsupport; 3) Getting in early to improve health; and 4) Accounting for food\nliteracy experiences. Discussion This is the first online nutrition program\nwith suitable behavioural supports for people with MS. It highlights the\nimportance of disease-specific and evidence-based nutrition education to\nsupport people with MS to make dietary changes. Acquiring nutrition knowledge,\ncoupled with practical support mechanisms such as recipe booklets and\ngoal-setting, emerged as crucial for facilitating engagement with the program.\nConclusions When designing education programs for people with MS and other\nneurological conditions, healthcare professionals and program designers should\nconsider flexible delivery and building peer support to address the needs and\nchallenges faced by participants.\n",

It denotes an individual's capacity to discern,\ncomprehend, and convey medication-related information. Existing scales,\nhowever, are time-consuming and predominantly cater to patients and community\ndwellers, necessitating a more succinct instrument. This study presents the\ndevelopment of a brief Medication Literacy Scale (MLS-14) utilizing classical\ntest theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT), targeting a college student\ndemographic. The MLS-14's abbreviated version, a 6-item scale (MLS-SF), was\ndistilled through CTT and IRT methodologies, engaging 2431 Chinese college\nstudents to scrutinize its psychometric properties. The MLS-SF demonstrated a\nCronbach's {\\alpha} of 0.765, with three extracted factors via exploratory\nfactor analysis, accounting for 66% of the cumulative variance. All items\nexhibited factor loadings above 0.5. The scale's three-factor structure was\nsubstantiated through confirmatory factor analysis with satisfactory fit\nindices (chi2/df=5.11, RMSEA=0.063, GFI=0.990, AGFI=0.966, NFI=0.984,\nIFI=0.987, CFI=0.987). IRT modeling confirmed reasonable discrimination and\nlocation parameters for all items, free of differential item functioning (DIF)\nby gender. Except for items 4 and 10, the remaining items were informative at\nmedium theta levels, indicating their utility in assessing medication literacy\nefficiently. The developed 6-item Medication Literacy Short Form (MLS-SF)\nproves to be a reliable and valid instrument for the expedited evaluation of\ncollege students' medication literacy, offering a valuable addition to the\narsenal of health literacy assessment tools.\n",

Current approaches for managing\nPMS and PMDD rely on daily mental condition recording, which many discontinue\ndue to its impracticality. Hence, there's a critical need for a simple,\nobjective method to monitor mental symptoms. One of the principal symptoms of\nPMDD is a dysfunction in emotional regulation, which has been demonstrated\nthrough brain-function imaging measurements to involve hyperactivity in the\namygdala and a decrease in functionality in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).\nHowever, most research has been focused on PMDD, leaving a gap in understanding\nof PMS. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures brain activity by\nspectroscopically determining the amount of hemoglobin in the blood vessels.\nThis study aimed to characterize the emotional regulation function in PMS. We\nmeasured brain activity in the PFC region using NIRS when participants were\npresented with emotion-inducing pictures. Furthermore, moods highly associated\nwith emotions were assessed through questionnaires. Forty-six participants were\ncategorized into non-PMS, PMS, and PMDD groups based on the gynecologist's\ndiagnosis. POMS2 scores revealed higher negative mood and lower positive mood\nin the follicular phase for the PMS group, while the PMDD group exhibited\nheightened negative mood during the luteal phase. NIRS results showed reduced\nemotional expression in the PMS group during both phases, while no significant\ndifferences were observed in the PMDD group compared to non-PMS. It was found\nthat there are differences in the distribution of mood during the luteal and\nfollicular phase and in cerebral blood flow responses to emotional stimuli\nbetween PMS and PMDD. These findings suggest the potential for providing\nindividuals with awareness of PMS or PMDD through scores on the POMS2 and NIRS\nmeasurements.\n",

We investigated if free-ranging dogs are capable of\nidentifying the person rewarding them and the amount of time required for them\nto learn it. We conducted field trials on randomly selected adult free-ranging\ndogs in West Bengal, India. On Day 1, a choice test was conducted. The\nexperimenter chosen did not provide reward while the other experimenter\nprovided a piece of boiled chicken followed by petting. The person giving\nreward on Day 1 served as the correct choice on four subsequent days of\ntraining. Day 6 was the test day when none of the experimenters had a reward.\nWe analyzed the choice made by the dogs, the time taken to approach during the\nchoice tests, and the socialization index, which was calculated based on the\nintensity of affiliative behaviour shown towards the experimenters. The dogs\nmade correct choices at a significantly higher rate on the fifth and sixth\ndays, as compared to Day 2, suggesting learning. This is the first study aiming\nto understand the time taken for individual human recognition in free-ranging\ndogs and can serve as the scaffold for future studies to understand the\ndog-human relationship in open environments, like urban ecosystems.\n",

The theory is simple as it posits that the amount of selection or\nAssembly is a function of the number of complex objects where their complexity\ncan be objectively determined using assembly indices. The assembly index of a\ngiven object relates to the number of recursive joining operations required to\nbuild that object and can be not only rigorously defined mathematically but can\nbe experimentally measured. In pervious work we outlined the theoretical basis,\nbut also extensive experimental measurements that demonstrated the predictive\npower of AT. These measurements showed that is a threshold in assembly indices\nfor organic molecules whereby abiotic chemical systems could not randomly\nproduce molecules with an assembly index greater or equal than 15. In a recent\npaper by Hazen et al [1] the authors not only confused the concept of AT with\nthe algorithms used to calculate assembly indices, but also attempted to\nfalsify AT by calculating theoretical assembly indices for objects made from\ninorganic building blocks. A fundamental misunderstanding made by the authors\nis that the threshold is a requirement of the theory, rather than experimental\nobservation. This means that exploration of inorganic assembly indices\nsimilarly requires an experimental observation, correlated with the theoretical\ncalculations. Then and only then can the exploration of complex inorganic\nmolecules be done using AT and the threshold for living systems, as expressed\nwith such building blocks, be determined. Since Hazen et al.[1] present no\nexperimental measurements of assembly theory, their analysis is not\nfalsifiable.\n",

Demographic information\nwas obtained using questionnaires from 72 participants, which included age,\ngender, educational level, exposure hours, occupation, and lifestyle. The blood\nglucose levels and body mass index (BMI) were measured using a Fine Test\nglucometer and a mechanical scale, respectively. The results showed that most\nof the people living or working around the cement company were middle-aged men\n(31-40; 42.06%) with a primary (33.33%) or secondary (45.83%) school education.\nIt showed that 30 (41.69%) of the participants were overweight while 5 (6.94%)\nwere obese.

Participants that were exposed for long hours (> 15 hours per\nday) were the most diabetic (20% of the participants), followed by smokers\n(15%), and artisans (7%). It can be concluded that exposure to cement dust from\nthe company increased the risk of overweight, obesity, and hyperglycemia among\nthe participants. These health risks were worsened by daily long hours of\nexposure, smoking, and artisanal pollutant exposure.

Next, they point out the challenges faced by\nuncertainty quantification techniques aimed at enhancing and trusting the\npredictions from these AI models. They also discuss how conceptual errors,\nunrealistic benchmarks and performance misestimation can confound the\nevaluation of models and thus their development. Lastly, the authors explain\nhow human bias, whether from AI experts or drug discovery experts, constitutes\nanother challenge that can be alleviated by gaining more prospective\nexperience.\n  Expert opinion: AI models are often developed to excel on retrospective\nbenchmarks unlikely to anticipate their prospective performance. As a result,\nonly a few of these models are ever reported to have prospective value (e.g. by\ndiscovering potent and innovative drug leads for a therapeutic target). The\nauthors have discussed what can go wrong in practice with AI for drug\ndiscovery.

It contextualizes\nmental health risk assessments and detection of social jet lag, which can\nhamper mental health and cognitive performance. Existing ways of determining\nchronotypes, such as Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) or the\nMorningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), are limited by being discrete in\ntime and time-intensive to update, meaning they rarely capture real-world\nvariability across time. Chronotyping users based on a daily planner app might\naugment existing methods to enable assessment continuously and at scale. This\npaper reports the construction of a supervised binary classifier that attempts\nto demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. 1,460 registered users from\nthe Owaves app opted in by filling out the MEQ survey between July 14, 2022,\nand May 1, 2023. 142 met the eligibility criteria. We used multimodal app data\nfrom individuals identified as morning and evening types from MEQ data, basing\nthe classifier on app time series data. This included daily timing for 8 main\nlifestyle activity types: exercise, sleep, social interactions, meal times,\nrelaxation, work, play, and miscellaneous, as defined in the app. The timing of\nactivities showed substantial change across time, as well as heterogeneity by\nactivity type. Our novel chronotyping classifier was able to predict the\nmorningness and eveningness of its users with an ROC AUC of 0.70. Our findings\ndemonstrate the feasibility of chronotype classification from multimodal,\nreal-world app data, while highlighting fundamental challenges to applying\ndiscrete and fixed labels to complex, dynamic, multimodal behaviors. Our\nfindings suggest a potential for real-time monitoring of shifts in chronotype\nspecific to different causes (i.e. types of activity), which could feasibly be\nused to support future, prospective mental health support research.\n",

There are\nclassic examples of local adaptations leading to speciation, driven by food\navailability. Urbanization across the world is causing rapid decline of\nbiodiversity, while also driving local adaptations in some species.\nFree-ranging dogs are an interesting example of adaptation to a human-dominated\nenvironment across varied habitats. They have co-existed with humans for\ncenturies and are a perfect model system for studying local adaptations. We\nattempted to understand a specific aspect of their scavenging behaviour in\nIndia: citrus aversion. Pet dogs are known to avoid citrus fruits and food\ncontaminated by them. In India, lemons are used widely in the cuisine, and\ndiscarded in the garbage. Hence, free-ranging dogs, that typically are\nscavengers of human leftovers, are likely to encounter lemons and\nlemon-contaminated food on a regular basis. We carried out a population level\nexperiment to test response of free-ranging dogs to chicken contaminated with\nvarious parts of lemon. The dogs avoided chicken contaminated with lemon juice\nthe most. Further, when provided with chicken dipped in three different\nconcentrations of lemon juice, the lowest concentration was most preferred. A\nsurvey confirmed that the local people use lemon in their diet extensively and\nalso discard these with the leftovers. People avoided giving citrus\ncontaminated food to their pets but did not follow the same caution for\nfree-ranging dogs. This study revealed that free-ranging dogs in West Bengal,\nIndia, are well adapted to scavenging among citrus-contaminated garbage and\nhave their own strategies to avoid the contamination as far as possible, while\nmaximizing their preferred food intake.\n",

We first read and preprocess a proprietary dataset\ncontaining approximately 140,000 protein sequences, including about 30,000\navGFP sequences. Subsequently, we constructed and trained a Transformer-based\nprediction model to screen and design new avGFP mutants that are expected to\nexhibit higher brightness.\n  Our methodology consists of two primary stages: first, the construction of a\nscoring model using BERT, and second, the screening and generation of mutants\nusing mutation site statistics and large language models. Through the analysis\nof predictive results, we designed and screened 10 new high-brightness avGFP\nsequences. This study not only demonstrates the potential of deep learning in\nprotein design but also provides new perspectives and methodologies for future\nresearch by integrating prior knowledge from large language models.\n",

        "summary": "  Composition is a powerful principle for systems biology, focused on the\ninterfaces, interconnections, and orchestration of distributed processes to\nenable integrative multiscale simulations. Whereas traditional models focus on\nthe structure or dynamics of specific subsystems in controlled conditions,\ncompositional systems biology aims to connect these models, asking critical\nquestions about the space between models: What variables should a submodel\nexpose through its interface? How do coupled models connect and translate\nacross scales? How do domain-specific models connect across biological and\nphysical disciplines to drive the synthesis of new knowledge? This approach\nrequires robust software to integrate diverse datasets and submodels, providing\nresearchers with tools to flexibly recombine, iteratively refine, and\ncollaboratively expand their models. This article offers a comprehensive\nframework to support this vision, including: a conceptual and graphical\nframework to define interfaces and composition patterns; standardized schemas\nthat facilitate modular data and model assembly; biological templates that\nintegrate detailed submodels that connect molecular processes to the emergence\nof the cellular interface; and user-friendly software interfaces that empower\nresearch communities to construct and improve multiscale models of cellular\nsystems. By addressing these needs, compositional systems biology will foster a\nunified and scalable approach to understanding complex cellular systems.\n",

While the search\nfor suitable biomarkers to inform aDBS has provided rich results over the last\ntwo decades, development of control strategies is not progressing at the same\npace. One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the\ncomplex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports\naDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a\nmodular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make\nexperimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the\nplatform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental\nsetup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The\nperformance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated\nin three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an\nArduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse\ngenerator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external\nneurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing\nsteps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the\nmicrocontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups\nin (b) and (c). The full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS\ncontext is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads\non a patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment and further\nevaluated in a non-invasive BCI speller application.\n",

Samples of artificially and naturally ripened mangoes were\nanalyzed for proximate composition using standard protocols. Cytogenotoxicity\nwas then assessed using the Allium cepa L. toxicity test. Twenty (20)A. cepa\n(onion) bulbs were used, with 5 ripened naturally, 5 with wood ash, 5 with\nherbaceous ash, and 5 with rice chips, all grown over tap water for five days.\nThe root tips of the bulbs were assayed and examined for chromosomal\naberrations. The results revealed a significant (P<0.05) increase in moisture,\nprotein, and ash content of mangoes as ripening agents were introduced. Mangoes\nripened with wood ash exhibited the highest moisture content (81%), while those\nripened with rice chips had the highest protein (0.5%) and ash content (1.5%).\nNaturally ripened mangoes displayed the highest fat (0.0095%) and fiber\n(11.46%) contents. The A. cepa toxicity test indicated significant (p<0.05)\ndifferences in the root growth of mangoes ripened with various agents. Wood ash\nresulted in the highest root growth (2.62cm), while herbaceous ash had the\nleast (2.18%). Chromosomal aberrations, including sticky, vagrant, and laggard\nabnormalities, were observed in all agents, with herbaceous ash exhibiting the\nhighest and rice chips the least. The obtained results suggest that induced\nripening of the fruits could induce toxicities, highlighting the necessity for\npublic awareness regarding the potential dangers posed by these agents.\n",

One reason for this is the fact that most\npediatric diseases are also rare diseases (i.e., they fit the EU definition of\na rare condition, by affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 individuals), and\nindeed the majority of conditions under this umbrella heading are in fact much\nrarer, affecting fewer than 1 in 100,000. Rare pediatric diseases incur\nparticular challenges, both in terms of actually conducting clinical trials but\nalso planning trials (and indeed, stimulating the preclinical research and\nknowledge generation necessary to embark on clinical trials in the first\nplace). The pediatric regulation and orphan regulation (covering rare diseases)\nwere introduced to address the complexities in research and development of\nmedicines specifically for children and for people living with a rare disease,\nrespectively. The regulations have been reasonably effective, particularly in\nareas where adult and pediatric diseases overlap, driving the development of\nmore pediatric medicines; however, challenges still remain, often exacerbated\nby the rarity of the diseases. These include issues around trial planning, the\nneed for more innovative methodologies in smaller populations, significant\ndelays in trial start up and recruitment, recruitment issues (due to small\npopulations and the nature of the conditions), lack of endpoints, and scarce\ndata. This chapter will discuss some of the major challenges in delivering\ntrials in pediatric rare diseases while also assessing current and future\nsolutions to address these.\n",

In particular, we\nshow that GitHub, a platform widely used for collaborative software projects,\ncan be effectively adapted to organize and document all aspects of a research\nproject's lifecycle in a molecular biology laboratory. We outline a three-step\napproach for incorporating the GitHub ecosystem into laboratory research\nworkflows: 1. designing and organizing experiments using issues and project\nboards, 2. documenting experiments and data analyses with a version control\nsystem, and 3. ensuring reproducible software environments for data analyses\nand writing tasks with containerized packages. The versatility, scalability,\nand affordability of this approach make it suitable for various scenarios,\nranging from small research groups to large, cross-institutional\ncollaborations.

With 390 million infections annually and 96 million showing clinical\nsymptoms, severe dengue can lead to life-threatening conditions like dengue\nhemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The only FDA-approved\nvaccine, Dengvaxia, has limitations due to antibody-dependent enhancement\n(ADE), necessitating careful administration. The recent pre-approval of TAK-003\nby WHO in 2024 highlights ongoing efforts to improve vaccine options. This\nreview explores recent advancements in dengue vaccine development, emphasizing\npotential utility of mRNA-based vaccines. By examining current clinical trial\ndata and innovations, we aim to identify promising strategies to address the\nlimitations of existing vaccines and enhance global dengue prevention efforts.\n",

However, the control group (without IBA) notably enhanced rooting when\ncompared to the various IBA concentrations. Cuttings in the control group\n(without IBA) and those planted in river sand exhibited notably high\npercentages of successful rooting, underscoring the importance of the selected\nplanting medium. Experiment 2. Bench grafting of loquat: The success of\ngrafting loquat cutting stocks varied based on grafting dates, types of\ncuttings, and concentrations of IBA. However, IBA at different concentrations\ndid not have a significant impact. Notably, certain interactions such as\ngrafting on February 20 with loquat stock cuttings, yielded higher percentages\nof successful graft bud sprouting. Experiment 3. Performance of grafting\nloquats onto different rootstocks: Grafting success was notably influenced by\nthe selection of rootstock, with loquat rootstock demonstrating superior\nperformance compared to quince. The highest significant levels of successful\ngrafting were attained on February 20, underscoring the crucial role of\ngrafting dates. Experiment 4. Impact of tree stock types on grafting success:\nGrafting success percentage was higher in loquat tree stock when compared to\nquince. The consistency of grafting success percentages across three dates\nunderscores the significant influence of rootstock type. Experiment 5. Bench\ngrafting of loquat cutting stocks: Graft bud sprout percentages exhibited\nvariations, with loquat stock cuttings surpassing quince. Grafting success\ndemonstrated a consistent increase from February 20 to March 30, underscoring\nthe importance of selecting appropriate grafting dates.\n",

Current practices often\nlead to the overuse of agronomic inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers and\nwater, resulting in environmental contamination and diminishing returns on crop\nproductivity. The complexity of agricultural systems, involving\nplant-environment interactions and human management, presents significant\nscientific and technical challenges for developing sustainable practices.\nAddressing these challenges necessitates transdisciplinary research, involving\nintense collaboration among fields such as plant science, engineering, computer\nscience, and social sciences. Here, we present five case studies from two\nresearch centers demonstrating successful transdisciplinary approaches toward\nmore sustainable water and fertilizer use. These case studies span multiple\nscales. Starting from whole-plant signaling, we explore how reporter plants can\ntransform our understanding of plant communication and enable efficient\napplication of water and fertilizers. We then show how new fertilizer\ntechnologies could increase the availability of phosphorus in the soil. To\naccelerate advancements in breeding new cultivars, we discuss robotic\ntechnologies for high-throughput plant screening in different environments at a\npopulation scale. At the ecosystem scale, we investigate phosphorus recovery\nfrom aquatic systems and methods to minimize phosphorus leaching. Finally, as\nagricultural outputs affect all people, we show how to integrate stakeholder\nperspectives and needs into the research. With these case studies, we hope to\nencourage the scientific community to adopt transdisciplinary research and\npromote cross-training among biologists, engineers, and social scientists to\ndrive discovery and innovation in advancing sustainable agricultural systems.\n",

A huge number almond\ntrees were observed for all locations, among them 38 trees were selected with\nthe best morphological characteristics which were chosen 9,3,5,7 and 14 trees\ndepending on the locations, respectively. A simple experiment was conducted\nusing RCBD for this experiment and means was separated by Duncans test. In\norder to evaluate their tolerances to drought in glass house, an experiment was\nconducted at Department of Horticulture, College of Agricultural Engineering\nSciences, University of Sulaimani, that seeds were taken from those genotype\ntrees and stratified then sown in pots. A factorial RCBD experiment was used\nwith two factors genotypes and irrigation intervals. Therefore, thirty eight\nseedling genotypes grown in pots under glasshouse condition were exposed to\nthree irrigation intervals 10,20 and 40 days after 10 days from seedling\nemergence. Therefore, the number of treatment combinations was 114 seedlings\nfor each replicate and with a total 342 seedlings for the whole experiment.\nAnalysis of variance was carried out and the means were compared according to\nLSD 0.05. As a result of the study, the seedlings showed different levels of\nadaptation to drought that can be used to future breeding programs as\nrootstocks. The objectives of this study were to identify morphological,\nphytochemical and genetic diversity with relatedness among the most important\nalmond genotypes in Sulaimani Region which related to drought tolerance to and\nrelationship between morphological, biochemical and molecular data.\n",

With these different approaches there\nare several potential sources of confusion which, if not accounted for, can\nlead to errors. Further potential for error arises if researchers wish to make\ncomparisons between the energetic content of nectars containing different\nratios of sucrose, fructose and glucose. Regardless of whether concentration is\nmeasured per mole or per unit mass, the energetic content differs between the\nhexose sugars (glucose and fructose) and sucrose. Appropriate conversion is\nneeded for direct comparison. Here we address these two issues with the\nfollowing aims. We consolidate the literature on this topic with examples of\nthe different methods for reporting nectar sugar concentrations, provide\ninsight into potential sources of error, and derive equations for converting\nbetween the different ways of expressing sugar concentration for the three\nprimary nectar sugars: sucrose, glucose and fructose. Second, we discuss the\nrelative energetic content of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and rationalise\nadjustment of \"energetic value\" rather than reporting concentration directly.\nIn this way, we hope to harmonise ongoing work in pollination ecology.\n",

To gain a clue to achieve this, we examined the long (16-hour)\nspontaneous exploratory locomotion of snails. The active forager snail, Tegula\nnigerrima, from an intertidal rocky shore was selected to test the general\nhypothesis that nervous systems are inherently near a critical state, which is\nself-organized to drive spontaneous animal behavior. This hypothesis, known as\nthe critical brain hypothesis, was originally proposed for vertebrate species,\nbut it might be applicable to other invertebrate species as well. We first\ninvestigated the power spectra of the speed of locomotion of the snails\n($N=39$). The spectra showed $1/{f^\\alpha}$ fluctuation, which is one of the\nsignatures of self-organized criticality. The $\\alpha$ was estimated to be\nabout 0.9. We further examined whether the spatial and temporal quantities show\nmultiple power-laws and scaling relations, which are rigorous criteria of\ncriticality. Although the satisfaction of these criteria is limited to a\ntruncated region and provides limited evidence to demonstrate the aspect of\nself-organization, the multiple power-laws and the scaling relations were\noverall satisfied.

        "summary": "  This paper statistically analysed pensioner longevity in Ghana. It\nfundamentally sought to ascertain the significant determinants of longevity\namongst Ghanaian pensioners, specifically, SSNIT pensioners by estimating the\nmortality rate of SSNIT pensioners, determining the factors that significantly\naffect the longevity of the average SSNIT pensioner and constructing a\npredictive model for predicting the longevity of SSNIT pensioners in Ghana.\nSecondary data was obtained from the leading pension provider in Ghana, SSNIT.\nThe results of the study revealed that the total number of male deaths was\nsignificantly greater, about four times more, than the total number of female\ndeaths. There was sufficient evidence that there exists a lower rate of death\namong female pensioners as compared to male pensioners. Furthermore, a\nsignificant number of the SSNIT pensioners used in the analysis survived less\nthan 8 years after retirement before their death and the average basic salary\nof the pensioners who lived less than 8 years after retirement was GH 7741.827\ncedis and served for 35.65 years on average. On the contrary, it was observed\nthat pensioners who lived more than 8 years after retirement had an average\nbasic salary of GH 5544.20 cedis and served for 31.49 years on average. In\nconclusion, predictors such as basic salary, the number of years of service in\nthe workforce, the age of the pensioner before death and the gender of the\npensioner were statistically significant in predicting the number of years a\nSSNIT pensioner survived after retirement before death that is, whether a\nparticular SSNIT pensioner survived less than 8 years or 8 years and above\nafter retirement. The authors recommend to employees that, their health should\nbe of great priority as every increase in the service year increases the\nlikelihood of a SSNIT pensioner surviving less than 8 years after retirement by\n22.36%.\n",

        "summary": "  Production of energy (metabolism) and its distribution is vital for living\norganisms, both at individual level - between different functions of an\norganism, as well as between species of communities at different organizational\nlevels, including food chains. Here, a new general method for finding\ndistribution of metabolic energy between different organismal functions is\nproposed. The method is based on earlier discoveries (in two independent\nstudies, for multicellular and unicellular organisms) that metabolic allometric\nscaling is the result of natural selection guided by optimization of\ndistribution of common resources between the species of a food chain. This\ndistribution is established in such a way that it secures amount of resources\nfor each species to reproduce in sufficient quantities (sufficient for\npreservation of a food chain), while not allowing some species acquiring too\nmany resources to jeopardize existence of other species they prey on or share\ncommon resources with. The introduced method was applied to birds, including\nboth steady and short flights modes. Birds' metabolism has specifics, because\nbesides other functions, it has to compensate force of gravity during the\nflight. However, this parameter is difficult to find, while such data is\nimportant for ecological studies at population and individual levels. We\ndiscovered increase of fraction of metabolic power required to compensate force\nof gravity with mass increase, which is a principal factor, restricting maximum\npossible mass of flying animals. The obtained results show efficiency of a\nproposed method for detailed studies of animals' metabolism, physiology, and of\npopulation ecology.\n",

Vermicompost produced under\nvarious combinations (T0, cow dung (CD) only; T1, 1CD:1RS; T2, 1CD:1PM, and T3,\n1CD:1RS:1PM) were further enriched by blending with biogenic nanoparticles.\nThis strategic combination enhances the nutritional composition of the\nvermicompost, contributing to its overall effectiveness in promoting plant\ngrowth and health. Various analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, XPS,\nFESEM-EDX, TEM, and ICP-OES, were employed for comprehensive characterization.\nThe synthesized TmONs with sizes ranging from 13 to 54 nm exhibited distinct\nCuO, NiO, and CoO phases. The vermicompost blended TmONs demonstrated\nsignificant improvements (P < 0.05) in seed germination (167%), coefficient\nvelocity (67%), and vigour index (95%), while reducing the mean germination\ntime by 41% for A. esculentus compared to the control group.

Furthermore, trace\nelement concentrations in both soil and plant leaves were found to be below the\nmaximum permissible limits set by WHO (1996). This investigation extends the\nunderstanding of the role played by these nanoparticles in fostering optimal\nconditions for plant growth and development as these micronutrients are\nessential components for several plant enzymes.\n",

Models typically ignore an\nimportant phenomenon observed in most experiments: photosynthetic rate is an\napproximately constant maximum value over a range of irradiances until\nphotoinhibition leads to decreasing photosynthetic rate. Here we develop a new\nmodel of photoinhibition that captures this plateau. We test six new models of\nphotoinhibition and ten more photoinhibition models from the literature against\na database of 1808 photosynthesis-irradiance curves exhibiting photoinhibition.\nIn the best model, photoinhibition is phenomenologically described by\nmultiplication by a saturating function of the reciprocal of irradiance,\nsimplifies to the widely-used Jassby & Platt photosynthesis-irradiance curve in\nthe absence of photoinhibition, and only requires one new parameter. This\nphotoinhibition parameter identifies the onset of photoinhibition and is the\nrate of decrease in photosynthetic rate at that irradiance. The parameters\ncommon to both of these models have a consistent interpretation, but our\nanalysis of 3,615 experiments and 10,000 simulated datasets revealed\nsignificant discrepancies in parameter interpretation across other widely-used\nphotoinhibition models. Deviations in parameter estimates across models of up\nto 40% were observed underscoring the need for consistent modeling approaches\nand supporting the application of our new photoinhibition model.\n",

A particularly\nuseful branch of NCT is optimal control, which focuses on applying theoretical\nand computational principles of control theory to design optimal strategies to\nachieve specific goals in neural processes. However, most existing research\nfocuses on optimally controlling brain network dynamics from the original state\nto a target state at a specific time point. In this paper, we present the first\ninvestigation of introducing optimal stochastic tracking control strategy to\nsynchronize the dynamics of the brain network to a target dynamics rather than\nto a target state at a specific time point. We utilized fMRI data from healthy\ngroups, and cases of stroke and post-stroke aphasia. For all participants, we\nutilized a gradient descent optimization method to estimate the parameters for\nthe brain network dynamic system. We then utilized optimal stochastic tracking\ncontrol techniques to drive original unhealthy dynamics by controlling a\ncertain number of nodes to synchronize with target healthy dynamics. Results\nshow that the energy associated with optimal stochastic tracking control is\nnegatively correlated with the intrinsic average controllability of the brain\nnetwork system, while the energy of the optimal state approaching control is\nsignificantly related to the target state value. For a 100-dimensional brain\nnetwork system, controlling the five nodes with the lowest tracking energy can\nachieve relatively acceptable dynamics control effects. Our results suggest\nthat stochastic tracking control is more aligned with the objective of brain\nstimulation interventions, and is closely related to the intrinsic\ncharacteristics of the brain network system, potentially representing a new\ndirection for future brain network optimal control research.\n",

In experiments,\nthe GE response to an inducing signal in a cell, measured by the amount of\nmRNAs/proteins synthesized, is found to be either graded or binary. The latter\ntype of response gives rise to a bimodal distribution in protein levels in an\nensemble of cells. One possible origin of binary response is cellular\nbistability achieved through positive feedback or autoregulation. In this\npaper, we study a simple, stochastic model of GE and show that the origin of\nbinary response lies exclusively in stochasticity. The transitions between the\nactive and inactive states of the gene are random in nature. Graded and binary\nresponses occur in the model depending on the relative stability of the\nactivated and deactivated gene states with respect to that of\nmRNAs/proteins.The theoretical results on binary response provide a good\ndescription of the ``all-or-none'' phenomenon observed in an eukaryotic system.\n",

In order to address these issues we define a set of novel\nquantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and\npredictability of the epidemic pattern.

We focus on a mesoscopic level that\noffers a multi-step pathway between the microscopic functions of neurons and\nthe macroscopic functions of brain systems revealed by hemodynamic imaging. We\nuse electroencephalographic (EEG) records collected from high-density electrode\narrays fixed on the epidural surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas in\nrabbits and cats trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli (CS) in the\nvarious modalities. High temporal resolution of EEG signals with the Hilbert\ntransform gives evidence for diverse intermittent spatial patterns of amplitude\n(AM) and phase modulations (PM) of carrier waves that repeatedly re-synchronize\nin the beta and gamma ranges at near zero time lags over long distances. The\ndominant mechanism for neural interactions by axodendritic synaptic\ntransmission should impose distance-dependent delays on the EEG oscillations\nowing to finite propagation velocities. It does not. EEGs instead show evidence\nfor anomalous dispersion: the existence in neural populations of a low velocity\nrange of information and energy transfers, and a high velocity range of the\nspread of phase transitions. This distinction labels the phenomenon but does\nnot explain it.

In a (genetically)\nuniform population a typically very small subpopulation becomes metabolically\ninactive whereas the majority subpopulation remains active and grows. Bacteria\nsuch as E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-superbug), Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1-3] show persistence. It can render\nbacteria less vulnerable in adverse environments [1, 4, 5] and their effective\neradication through medication more difficult [2, 3, 6]. Here we show that\nmedication treatment regimes may have to be modified when persistence is taken\ninto account and characterize optimal approaches assuming that the total\nmedication dose is constrained. The determining factors are cumulative\ntoxicity, eradication power of the medication and bacterial response\ntimescales. Persistent organisms have to be fought using tailored eradication\nstrategies which display two fundamental characteristics. Ideally, the\ntreatment time should be significantly longer than in the case of persistence\nwith the medication uniformly spread out over time; however, if treatment time\nhas to be limited, then the application of medication has to be concentrated\ntowards the beginning and end of the treatment. These findings deviate from\ncurrent clinical practice, and may therefore help to optimize and simplify\ntreatments. Our use of multi-objective optimization [7] to map out the optimal\nstrategies can be generalized to other related problems.\n",

To be able to say if the structure of certain\nnetwork is expected or not, one needs a reference model (null model). One\nfrequently used null model is the ensemble of graphs with the same set of\ndegrees as the original network. In this paper we argue that this ensemble can\nbe more than just a null model -- it also carries information about the\noriginal network and factors that affect its evolution. By mapping out this\nensemble in the space of some low-level network structure -- in our case those\nmeasured by the assortativity and clustering coefficients -- one can for\nexample study how close to the valid region of the parameter space the observed\nnetworks are. Such analysis suggests which quantities are actively optimized\nduring the evolution of the network. We use four very different biological\nnetworks to exemplify our method. Among other things, we find that high\nclustering might be a force in the evolution of protein interaction networks.\nWe also find that all four networks are conspicuously robust to both random\nerrors and targeted attacks.\n",

Acknowledging emergence as a key biological property, it has been\nproved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing biological\ncomplexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of\nbiological complexity is rooted in the knowledge of biological reality, an\nexpression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological biological\nreality, in the form of an uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two\ntheorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer\ndependent nature of description of biological reality. They explain the reasons\nbehind failures to construct a single and complete biological complexity\nmeasure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore\nprovides a reliable and general way to study biological complexity and\nbiological reality.\n",

We deduce an integral equation for the\nage-dependent force of infection, which depends on a number of parameters that\ncan be estimated from the force of infection in steady state prior to the\nvaccination program. We present the results of our simulations, which are\ncompared with observed data. We also examine the influence of contact patterns\namong members of a community on the age-dependent intensity of transmission of\nrubella and on the results of vaccination strategies. As an example of the\ntheory proposed, we calculate the effects of vaccination strategies for four\ncommunities from Caieiras (Brazil), Huixquilucan (Mexico), Finland and the\nUnited Kingdom. The results for each community differ considerably according to\nthe distinct intensity and pattern of transmission in the absence of\nvaccination. We conclude that this simple vaccination program is not very\nefficient (very slow) in the goal of eradicating the disease.

The physical property of the brain\nemployed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the\nbrain-graph or connectome). epsilon-supervenience allows us to determine\nwhether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to\nwithin any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the\nrelationship between the two.

It has been shown that repeated social defeats\nin 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the\nexpressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the\nelevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social\ninteractions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory\nactivity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of\napproaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming\nbehavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5\nmg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in\nthe elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the\npartition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the\nlevel of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of\napproaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is\nconcluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated\nmale mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social\nbehavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is\nsupposed that this behavioral approach may be useful for studying the molecular\nmechanisms of autistic spectrum disorders, developing under chronic negative\nsocial experiences.\n",

We identified some pos- sible geomorphological controls\nthat influence nest-site selection and survival using data collected along the\nFlorida Gulf coast. In particular we focused on the effects of beach\nreplenishment interventions on the Snowy Plover (SP), and on the migratory\nPiping Plover (PP) (Charadrius melodus) and Red Knot (RK) (Calidris canutus).\nTo quantify the relationship between past renourishment projects and shorebird\nspecies we used a Monte Carlo procedure to sample from the posterior\ndistribution of the binomial probabilities that a region is not a nesting or a\nwintering ground conditional on the occurrence of a beach replenishment\nintervention in the same and the previous year. The results indicate that it\nwas 2.3, 3.1, and 0.8 times more likely that a region was not a wintering\nground following a year with a renourishment intervention for the SP, PP and RK\nrespectively. For the SP it was 2.5. times more likely that a region was not a\nbreeding ground after a renourishment event. Through a maximum entropy\nprinciple model we observed small differences in the habitat use of the SP\nduring the breeding and the wintering season. However the habitats where RK was\nobserved ap- peared quite different. Maintaining and creating optimal suitable\nhabitats for SP characterized by sparse low vegetation in the foredunes areas,\nand uneven/low-slope beach surfaces, is the proposed conservation scenario to\nconvert anthropic beach restorations and SP populations into a positive\nfeedback without impacting other threatened shorebird species.\n",

We show that this approach is able to infer general\nrules for interaction, or lack of interaction, among members of a flock or,\nmore generally, any community. Using experimental field measurements of homing\npigeons in flight we demonstrate the existence of a basic distance dependent\nattraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to\nexplain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals\nover time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of\nbuilding complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior.\nTopological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the\ncomponents within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with\nsimulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek\nmodel. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show\nthat the more complex three dimensional models are capable of predicting and\nsimulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics.\nThe simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of\nthe collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the\ninitial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach\nmay be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and\ncollective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement.\nFrom these models, the behavior of the individual agents (animals) may be\ninferred.\n",

But\nextrapolating complex bio-systems to life's origins, brings up a paradox: how\ncould simple organics--lacking the 'soft matter' response properties of today's\nbio-molecules--have dissipated energy from primordial reactions in a controlled\nmanner for their 'ordering'? Nevertheless, a causal link of life's macroscopic\nirreversible dynamics to the microscopic reversible laws of statistical\nmechanics is indicated via the 'functional-takeover' of a soft magnetic\nscaffold by organics (c.f. Cairns-Smith's 'crystal-scaffold'). A\nfield-controlled structure offers a mechanism for bootstrapping--bottom-up\nassembly with top-down control: its super-paramagnetic components obey\nreversible dynamics, but its dissipation of H-field energy for aggregation\nbreaks time-reversal symmetry. The responsive adjustments of the controlled\n(host) mineral system to environmental changes would bring about mutual\ncoupling between random organic sets supported by it; here the generation of\nlong-range correlations within organic (guest) networks could include SOC-like\nmechanisms. And, such cooperative adjustments enable the selection of the\nfunctional configuration by altering the inorganic network's capacity to assist\na spontaneous process. A non-equilibrium dynamics could now drive the\nkinetically-oriented system towards a series of phase-transitions with\nappropriate organic replacements 'taking-over' its functions.\n",

The present generation views\nbiology through the powerful lenses of structural and (molecular) dynamic\nanalysis, understandably enough because of the beauty and power of the\nanalysis, and the ease of using these structures with present freely available\nsoftware. The problem is that these powerful lenses offer such magnification\nthat the engineering approach cannot be seen.

The amount of produced biomass,\nin turn, defines the composition of biochemical reactions.

A computer program tells me that a mean value is 12.3456789012,\nbut how many of these digits are significant (the rest being random junk)?\nShould I report: 12.3?, 12.3456?, or even 10 (if only the first digit is\nsignificant)? There are several rules-of-thumb but, surprisingly (given that\nthe problem is so common in science), none seem to be evidence-based. RESULTS.\nHere I show how the significance of a digit in a particular decade of a mean\ndepends on the standard error of the mean (SEM). I define an index, DM that can\nbe plotted in graphs. From these a simple evidence-based rule for the number of\nsignificant digits (\"sigdigs\") is distilled: the last sigdig in the mean is in\nthe same decade as the first or second non-zero digit in the SEM. As example,\nfor mean 34.63 (SEM 25.62), with n = 17, the reported value should be 35 (SEM\n26). Digits beyond these contain little or no useful information, and should\nnot be reported lest they damage your credibility.\n",

        "summary": "  Aging is analyzed as the spontaneous loss of adaptivity and increase in\nfragility that characterizes dynamic systems. Cybernetics defines the general\nregulatory mechanisms that a system can use to prevent or repair the damage\nproduced by disturbances. According to the law of requisite variety,\ndisturbances can be held in check by maximizing buffering capacity, range of\ncompensatory actions, and knowledge about which action to apply to which\ndisturbance. This suggests a general strategy for rejuvenating the organism by\nincreasing its capabilities of adaptation. Buffering can be optimized by\nproviding sufficient rest together with plenty of nutrients: amino acids,\nantioxidants, methyl donors, vitamins, minerals, etc. Knowledge and the range\nof action can be extended by subjecting the organism to an as large as possible\nvariety of challenges. These challenges are ideally brief so as not to deplete\nresources and produce irreversible damage. However, they should be sufficiently\nintense and unpredictable to induce an overshoot in the mobilization of\nresources for damage repair, and to stimulate the organism to build stronger\ncapabilities for tackling future challenges. This allows them to override the\ntrade-offs and limitations that evolution has built into the organism's repair\nprocesses in order to conserve potentially scarce resources. Such acute,\n\"hormetic\" stressors strengthen the organism in part via the \"order from noise\"\nmechanism that destroys dysfunctional structures by subjecting them to strong,\nrandom variations. They include heat and cold, physical exertion, exposure,\nstretching, vibration, fasting, food toxins, micro-organisms, environmental\nenrichment and psychological challenges.\n",

In regions where the\nnatural light source, i.e. solar radiation, is not sufficient for growth\noptimization, additional light sources are being used. Traditional light\nsources such as high pressure sodium lamps and other metal halide lamps are not\nvery efficient and generate high radiant heat. Therefore, new sustainable\nsolutions should be developed for energy efficient greenhouse lighting. Recent\ndevelopments in the field of light source technologies have opened up new\nperspectives for sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of\nlight-emitting diodes, i.e. LEDs, for greenhouse lighting. This review focuses\non the potential of LEDs to replace traditional light sources in the\ngreenhouse. In a comparative economic analysis of traditional vs. LED lighting,\nwe show that the introduction of LEDs allows reduction of the production cost\nof vegetables in the long-run of several years, due to the high energy\nefficiency, low maintenance cost and longevity of LEDs. In order to evaluate\nLEDs as a true alternative to current lighting sources, species specific plant\nresponse to different wavelengths is discussed in a comparative study. However,\nmore detailed scientific studies are necessary to understand the effect of\ndifferent LED spectra on plants physiology. Technical innovations are required\nto design and realize an energy efficient light source with a spectrum tailored\nfor optimal plant growth in specific plant species.\n",

Several models have been proposed for explaining the\norigin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,\nprevious models only demonstrate either two important observations for the\nallometric scaling: the variability of scaling exponents and predominance of\n3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their validity. In this\nstudy, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that\ntotal surface area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two\nobservations by combining two concepts: the impact of cell sizes on metabolic\nrate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model both\ntheoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law\nalthough several different biological strategies are considered. The model\nvalidity is confirmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the model suggests the\nimportance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric\nscaling. The proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the\norigin of allometric scaling laws in biology, despite several limitations of\nthe model.\n",

The genetic\ncode is revisited in this paper, addressing alternative representations for it,\nwhich can be worthy for genomic signal processing. Three original\nrepresentations are discussed. The inner-to-outer map builds on the unbalanced\nrole of nucleotides of a 'codon' and it seems to be suitable for handling\ninformation-theory-based matter. The two-dimensional-Gray map representation is\noffered as a mathematically structured map that can help interpreting\nspectrograms or scalograms.

Suggested by the diagram we propose a Hamilton quaternions based\nmathematical representation of the code as it stands now-a-days. The central\nobject in the description is a codon function that assigns to each amino acid\nan integer quaternion in such a way that the observed code degeneration is\npreserved. We emphasize the advantages of a quaternionic representation of\namino acids taking as an example the folding of proteins. With this aim we\npropose an algorithm to go from the quaternions sequence to the protein three\ndimensional structure which can be compared with the corresponding experimental\none stored at the Protein Data Bank. In our criterion the mathematical\nrepresentation of the genetic code in terms of quaternions merits to be taken\ninto account because it describes not only most of the known properties of the\ngenetic code but also opens new perspectives that are mainly derived from the\nclose relationship between quaternions and rotations.\n",

An initial screening of different species of\nfungi has been conducted. Fungal growth medium was overlaid onto cured concrete\nplate. Mycelial discs were aseptically deposited at the plate center. The\nresults showed that, due to the dissolving of Ca(OH)2 from concrete, the pH of\nthe growth medium increased from its original value of 6.5 to 13.0. Despite the\ndrastic pH increase, Trichoderma reesei (ATCC13631) spores germinated into\nhyphal mycelium and grew equally well with or without concrete. X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that the\ncrystals precipitated on the fungal hyphae were composed of calcite.

During the last ten years the problem of the\norigin of life has become an innovative research subject approached by many\nauthors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the\nproblem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second\npresents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded\non the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in\nthe third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum\norigin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two\nof which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and\nbiosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and\nexperimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main\nresearch themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a\nphysicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life\nwhile the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the\nessence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the\nInformation Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life\nthrough replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is\nfundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum\ncomputation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto\nreplicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence\nof quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve\nthe question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put\nforward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in\nthe origin of genetic language.\n",

The goal of\nthis study is to explore a new self-healing approach in which fungi are used as\na self-healing agent to promote calcium carbonate precipitation to fill the\ncracks in concrete structures. Recent research results in the field of\ngeomycology have shown that many species of fungi could play an important role\nin promoting calcium carbonate mineralization, but their application in\nself-healing concrete has not been reported. Therefore, a screening of\ndifferent species of fungi has been conducted in this study.

The diversity of species on Earth is so large that our quest\nfor extraterrestrial life cannot be limited to forms and shapes present and\nknown to us from our environment.

First,\nit should represent a growing open thermodynamic system (in biological terms -\na cell), and thus be a system out of equilibrium. Second, it must perform\nsynthesis, self-assembly and accumulation processes (in biological terms to\ngrow, maintain homeostasis, respond to environment, reproduce, exchange matter\nand energy, evolve). Populated planets are consisted of two components:\nbiosphere and its environment (geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere). Living\nmatter and its environment are out of equilibrium.

First, a planet receives\nenergy from its star, which leads to disequilibrium for external reasons.\nAnimate matter contributes to disequilibrium for internal reasons: accumulation\nof matter and self-assembly.

In particular, it was suggested that the optimal\nlocation for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part\nof cells. However, as the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too\nspeculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because encoding/decoding a\nsignature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt is\ndoomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss\nthe motivation for inserting a signature. We then show that \"biological SETI\"\ninvolves even weaker assumptions than traditional SETI and admits a\nwell-defined methodological framework. After assessing the possibility in terms\nof molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting\nthe guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first\nprinciples and be convention-free, develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the\ncanonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision structure of interlocked\nsystematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,\nwe perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses.\nStatistical analysis reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the\ncode, interdependence analysis precludes overinterpretation, and comparison\nanalysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic structures,\nin agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the\ncanonical code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found\nattributes are consistent with the initial assumption, but that they make\nperfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some of the most\nuniversal codes of culture.\n",

        "summary": "  Embryogenesis, the process by which an organism forms and develops, has long\nbeen and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By\nwhich means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,\nand eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions\nour understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific\ntheories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems\nto have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited\nlong ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical\nproperties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc\nproposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that\nbiology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and\nlife-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and\ndiffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to\nidentify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.\nWhile Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later\nacclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th\ncentury. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical\napproach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long\nforsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology\nincreasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the\nmechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our\nreluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.\n",

Our first step is to provide foundations for modelling of\nemergent and evolving dynamic multi-level organic complexes and their\nsustentative processes in artificial and natural life systems. Main\napplications are in life sciences, medicine, ecology and astrobiology, as well\nas robotics, industrial automation and man-machine interface. Since 2011 over\n100 scientists from a number of disciplines have been exploring a substantial\nset of theoretical frameworks for a comprehensive theory of life known as\nIntegral Biomathics. That effort identified the need for a robust core model of\norganisms as dynamic wholes, using advanced and adequately computable\nmathematics. The work described here for that core combines the advantages of a\nsituation and context aware multivalent computational logic for active\nself-organizing networks, Wandering Logic Intelligence (WLI), and a multi-scale\ndynamic category theory, Memory Evolutive Systems (MES), hence WLIMES. This is\npresented to the modeller via a formal augmented reality language as a first\nstep towards practical modelling and simulation of multi-level living systems.\nInitial work focuses on the design and implementation of this visual language\nand calculus (VLC) and its graphical user interface. The results will be\nintegrated within the current methodology and practices of theoretical biology\nand (personalized) medicine to deepen and to enhance the holistic understanding\nof life.\n",

As an alternative to\ntobacco, the use of electronic cigarettes (ECig) has been increased\ndramatically over the last decade. ECig use is hypothesized to impact smoking\nbehavior through several pathways, not only as a means of quitting cigarettes\nand lowering risk of relapse, but also as both an alternative nicotine delivery\ndevice to cigarettes, as a visible use of nicotine that can lead to imitative\nbehavior in the form of smoking, and as a gateway nicotine delivery technology\nthat can build high levels of nicotine tolerance and pave the way for\ninitiation of smoking. Evidence regarding the effect of ECig use on smoking\nbehavior change remains inconclusive. To address these challenges, we built an\nagent-based model (ABM) of smoking and ECig use to examine the effects of ECig\nuse on smoking behavior change. The impact of social network (SN) on the\ninitiation of smoking and ECig use were also explored. Findings from the\nsimulation suggest that the use of ECig generates substantially lower\nprevalence of current smoker (PCS), which demonstrates the potential for\nreducing smoking and lowering the risk of relapse. The effects of\nproximity-based influences within SN increases the prevalence of current ECig\nuser (PCEU). The model also suggests the importance of improved understanding\nof drivers in cessation and relapse in ECig use, in light of findings that such\naspects of behavior change may notably influence smoking behavior change and\nburden.\n",

A critical element involves essential workforce management since\ncurrent protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals,\nincluding essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several\ncountries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity.\nThis work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data\nperformed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR\ntest results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for\nhandling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential\nworkforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to\npredict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or\nresults are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow\nfine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed\nmodels can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with\nhigh accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in\nan individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on\nhemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is\nsignificantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed,\ncompared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and\nother critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from\nwidely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR\nresults used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist\nstrategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel\nshortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.\n",

A thorough parametric analysis of\nthe noise-induced transition from this oscillatory regime to complete tumor\ndominance is carried out. A hysteresis phenomenon is uncovered, which\nstabilizes the tumor at its carrying capacity and drives the healthy and the\nimmune cell populations to their extinction.

Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt\nto safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to\nquantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of\nSARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a\nneural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative\ninfected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government\nrestriction time series, to understanding the best set of mitigating actions.\nData for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model\ngovernment restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social\ndistance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government\nactions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter\nentry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less\nconfirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but\nmilder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting\nTaiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely\ndata-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical\nepidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that\nthe data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.\n",

Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding\ninterventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the\nface of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from\nthe Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May\n2020).

Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate\nthe development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. The roadmap\nrequires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and\npolicy-makers, and is made up of three parts: i) improve estimation of key\nepidemiological parameters; ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in\npopulations; iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in\nLow-to-Middle-Income countries.

That is, we seem early. We offer this explanation: a deadline is set by\n'loud' aliens who are born according to a hard steps power law, expand at a\ncommon rate, change their volumes' appearances, and prevent advanced life like\nus from appearing in their volumes. 'Quiet' aliens, in contrast, are much\nharder to see. We fit this three-parameter model of loud aliens to data: 1)\nbirth power from the number of hard steps seen in Earth history, 2) birth\nconstant by assuming a inform distribution over our rank among loud alien birth\ndates, and 3) expansion speed from our not seeing alien volumes in our sky. We\nestimate that loud alien civilizations now control 40-50% of universe volume,\neach will later control ~10^5 - 3x10^7 galaxies, and we could meet them in\n~200Myr - 2Gyr. If loud aliens arise from quiet ones, a depressingly low\ntransition chance (~10^-4) is required to expect that even one other quiet\nalien civilization has ever been active in our galaxy.

        "summary": "  We axiomatize the molecular-biology reasoning style, show compliance of the\nstandard reference: Ptashne, A Genetic Switch, and present proof-theory-induced\ntechnologies to help infer phenotypes and to predict life cycles from\ngenotypes. The key is to note that `reductionist discipline' entails\nconstructive reasoning: any proof of a compound property can be decomposed to\nproofs of constituent properties. Proof theory makes explicit the inner\nstructure of the axiomatized reasoning style and allows the permissible\ndynamics to be presented as a mode of computation that can be executed and\nanalyzed. Constructivity and execution guarantee simulation when working over\ndomain-specific languages. Here, we exhibit phenotype properties for genotype\nreasons: a molecular-biology argument is an open-system concurrent computation\nthat results in compartment changes and is performed among processes of\nphysiology change as determined from the molecular programming of given DNA.\nLife cycles are the possible sequentializations of the processes. A main\nimplication of our construction is that formal correctness provides a\ncomplementary perspective on science that is as fundamental there as for pure\nmathematics. The bulk of the presented work has been verified formally correct\nby computer.\n",

These\nrecordings represent, for each patient, a time series consisting of 1 value of\nglycaemia per minute during 24 hours and 14 days, i.e., 20,160 data point.\nThus, while using numerical methods, these time series have been anonymously\nanalyzed. Nevertheless, because of the stochastic inputs induced by daily\nactivities of any human being, it has not been possible to discriminate chaos\nfrom noise. So, we have decided to keep only the 14 nights of these ten\npatients. Then, the determination of the time delay and embedding dimension\naccording to the delay coordinate embedding method has allowed us to estimate\nfor each patient the correlation dimension and the maximal Lyapunov exponent.\nThis has led us to show that type 1 diabetes could indeed be a chaotic\nphenomenon. Once this result has been confirmed by the determinism test, we\nhave computed the Lyapunov time and found that the limit of predictability of\nthis phenomenon is nearly equal to half the 90-minutes sleep-dream cycle. We\nhope that our results will prove to be useful to characterize and predict blood\nglucose variations.\n",

Therapeutic knowledge and drug\nmechanism play a crucial role in determining the strategy and defining the\nestimand for clinical trial designs. Clinical trials in patients with\nhematological malignancies often present unique challenges for trial design due\nto complexity of treatment options and existence of potential curative but\nhighly risky procedures, e.g. stem cell transplant or treatment sequence across\ndifferent phases (induction, consolidation, maintenance). Here, we illustrate\nhow to apply the estimand framework in hematological clinical trials and how\nthe estimand framework can address potential difficulties in trial result\ninterpretation.\n  This paper is a result of a cross-industry collaboration to connect the\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E9 addendum concepts to\napplications. Three randomized phase 3 trials will be used to consider common\nchallenges including intercurrent events in hematologic oncology trials to\nillustrate different scientific questions and the consequences of the estimand\nchoice for trial design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.\nTemplate language for describing estimand in both study protocols and\nstatistical analysis plans is suggested for statisticians' reference.\n",

This challenge has been highlighted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, showing how viruses can quickly spread and how they can\nimpact society as a whole. Novel techniques that bring in different disciplines\nmust emerge to provide forward-looking strategies to combat viral infections,\nas well as possible future pandemics. In the past decade, an interdisciplinary\narea involving bioengineering, nanotechnology and information and communication\ntechnology (ICT) has been developing, known as Molecular Communications. This\nnew emerging area uses elements of classical communication systems and maps it\nto molecular signalling and communication found inside and outside the body,\nwhere the aim is to develop new tools that can serve future medicine. In this\npaper, we provide an extensive and detailed discussion on how Molecular\nCommunications can be integrated into the research on viral infectious diseases\nmodelling, and how possible treatment and vaccines can be developed considering\nmolecules as information carriers. We provide a literature review on the\nexisting models of Molecular Communications for viral infection (in-body and\nout-body), a deep analysis on their effects on the host and subsequent\ncommunication process for other systems within the body (e.g., immune\nresponse), sources of experimental data on known viral infections and how it\ncan be used by the Molecular Communications community, as well as open issues\nand future directions. Since the development of therapeutics/vaccines needs an\ninterdisciplinary approach centred around ICT, we are confident that Molecular\nCommunications can play a central role here by providing a detail\ncharacterisation and manipulation of the propagation of molecules in different\nmedia.\n",

In order to reach the same\nmaximal productivities as with the polychromatic lightening control conditions\n(red + blue, P/2e- = 1.275), the need to work with an optimal range of\nwavelength around 620 nm was first established on batch and continuous\ncultures. The long-term physiological and kinetic behavior was then verified in\na continuous photobioreactor illuminated only with red (620 nm) LED, showing\nthat the maximum productivities can be maintained over 30 residence times with\nonly minor changes in the pigment content of the cells corresponding to a\nwell-known adaptation mechanism of the photosystems, but without any effect on\ngrowth and stoichiometry. For both poly and monochromatic incident light\ninputs, a predictive spectral knowledge model was proposed and validated for\nthe first time, allowing the calculation of the kinetics and stoichiometry\nobserved in any photobioreactor cultivating A. platensis, or other\ncyanobacteria if the parameters were updated. It is shown that the photon flux\n(with a specified wavelength) must be used instead of light energy flux as a\nrelevant control variable for the growth. The experimental and theoretical\nresults obtained in this study demonstrate that it is possible to save the\nenergy consumed by the lightening device of photobioreactors using red LED, the\nspectral range of which is defined according to the action spectrum of\nphotosynthesis. This appears to be crucial information for applications in\nwhich the energy must be rationalized, as it is the case for life support\nsystems in closed environments like a permanent spatial base or a submarine.\n",

        "summary": "  One year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the origin of SARS-CoV-2\nstill eludes humanity. Early publications firmly stated that the virus was of\nnatural origin, and the possibility that the virus might have escaped from a\nlab was discarded in most subsequent publications. However, based on a\nre-analysis of the initial arguments, highlighted by the current knowledge\nabout the virus, we show that the natural origin is not supported by conclusive\narguments, and that a lab origin cannot be formally discarded. We call for an\nopening of peer-reviewed journals to a rational, evidence-based and\nprejudice-free evaluation of all the reasonable hypotheses about the virus'\norigin. We advocate that this debate should take place in the columns of\nrenowned scientific journals, rather than being left to social media and\nnewspapers.\n",

Artificial neural networks are a particular class of\nmachine learning algorithms and models that evolved into what is now described\nas deep learning. Given the computational advances made in the last decade,\ndeep learning can now be applied to massive data sets and in innumerable\ncontexts. Therefore, deep learning has become its own subfield of machine\nlearning. In the context of biological research, it has been increasingly used\nto derive novel insights from high-dimensional biological data. To make the\nbiological applications of deep learning more accessible to scientists who have\nsome experience with machine learning, we solicited input from a community of\nresearchers with varied biological and deep learning interests. These\nindividuals collaboratively contributed to this manuscript's writing using the\nGitHub version control platform and the Manubot manuscript generation toolset.\nThe goal was to articulate a practical, accessible, and concise set of\nguidelines and suggestions to follow when using deep learning. In the course of\nour discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding\nand applying machine learning fundamentals as a baseline for utilizing deep\nlearning, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful\nevaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated\nby deep learning, among others.\n",

Here we describe a course on stochastic\nprocesses in biology, delivered between September and December 2020 to a mixed\naudience of mathematicians and biologists. In addition to traditional lectures\nand homeworks, we incorporated a series of weekly computational challenges into\nthe course. These challenges served to familiarize students with the main\nmodeling concepts, and provide them with an introduction on how to implement\nthem in a research-like setting. In order to account for the different academic\nbackgrounds of the students, they worked on the challenges in small groups, and\npresented their results and code in a dedicated discussion class each week. We\ndiscuss our experience designing and implementing an element of problem-based\nlearning in an applied mathematics course through computational challenges. We\nalso discuss feedback from students, and describe the content of the challenges\npresented in the course. We provide all materials, along with example code for\na number of challenges.\n",

In this paper, we study two\nmathematical models of a drug assimilation in the human system using Physics\nInformed Neural Networks (PINNs). In the first model, we consider the case of\nsingle dose of drug in the human system and in the second case, we consider the\ncourse of this drug taken at regular intervals. We have used the compartment\ndiagram to model these cases. The resulting differential equations are solved\nusing PINN, where we employ a feed forward multilayer perceptron as function\napproximator and the network parameters are tuned for minimum error. Further,\nthe network is trained by finding the gradient of the error function with\nrespect to the network parameters. We have employed DeepXDE, a python library\nfor PINNs, to solve the simultaneous first order differential equations\ndescribing the two models of drug assimilation. The results show high degree of\naccuracy between the exact solution and the predicted solution as much as the\nresulting error reaches10^(-11) for the first model and 10^(-8) for the second\nmodel. This validates the use of PINN in solving any dynamical system.\n",

The preliminary results -- without considering epistasis effects\nexplicitly -- indicate that the protein marginal-stability change upon point\nmutations provides the necessary and sufficient information to describe,\nthrough a Boltzmann factor, the evolution of the amide hydrogen-exchange\nprotection factors. This finding is of paramount importance because it\nillustrates the impact of point mutations on both the protein\nmarginal-stability and the ensemble of folded conformations coexisting with the\nnative state and, in the presence of metamorphism, on the propensity for the\nappearance of new folds and functions.\n",

        "summary": "  Statistical mechanics has grown without bounds in space. Statistical\nmechanics of point particles in an unbounded perfect gas is commonly accepted\nas a foundation for understanding many systems, including liquids like the\nconcentrated salt solutions of life and electrochemical technology, from\nbatteries to nanodevices. Liquids, however, are not gases. Liquids are filled\nwith interacting molecules and so the model of a perfect gas is imperfect. Here\nwe show that statistical mechanics without bounds (in space) is impossible as\nwell as imperfect, if the molecules interact as charged particles, as nearly\nall atoms do. The behavior of charged particles is not defined until boundary\nstructures and values are defined because charges are governed by the Maxwell\npartial differential equations. Partial differential equations require boundary\nconditions to be computable or well defined. The Maxwell equations require\nboundary conditions on finite sized spatial boundaries (i.e., structures).\nBoundary conditions cannot be defined 'at infinity' in a general (i.e., unique)\nway because the limiting process that defines infinity includes such a wide\nvariety of behavior, from light waves that never decay, to fields from dipole\nand multipolar charges that decay steeply, to Coulomb fields that decay but not\nso steeply. Statistical mechanics involving charges thus involves spatial\nboundaries and boundary conditions of finite size. Nearly all matter involves\ncharges, thus nearly all statistical mechanics requires structures and boundary\nconditions on those structures. Boundaries and boundary conditions are not\nprominent in classical statistical mechanics. Including boundaries is a\nchallenge to mathematicians. Statistical mechanics must describe bounded\nsystems if it is to provide a proper foundation for studying matter.\n",

To advance these aims, the field leverages experiments, platforms, data,\nand model organisms from both spaceborne and ground-analog studies. As research\nis extended beyond low Earth orbit, experiments and platforms must be maximally\nautonomous, light, agile, and intelligent to expedite knowledge discovery. Here\nwe present a summary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration on artificial intelligence,\nmachine learning, and modeling applications which offer key solutions toward\nthese space biology challenges. In the next decade, the synthesis of artificial\nintelligence into the field of space biology will deepen the biological\nunderstanding of spaceflight effects, facilitate predictive modeling and\nanalytics, support maximally autonomous and reproducible experiments, and\nefficiently manage spaceborne data and metadata, all with the goal to enable\nlife to thrive in deep space.\n",

        "summary": "  Cancers are complex adaptive diseases regulated by the nonlinear feedback\nsystems between genetic instabilities, environmental signals, cellular protein\nflows, and gene regulatory networks. Understanding the cybernetics of cancer\nrequires the integration of information dynamics across multidimensional\nspatiotemporal scales, including genetic, transcriptional, metabolic,\nproteomic, epigenetic, and multi-cellular networks. However, the time-series\nanalysis of these complex networks remains vastly absent in cancer research.\nWith longitudinal screening and time-series analysis of cellular dynamics,\nuniversally observed causal patterns pertaining to dynamical systems, may\nself-organize in the signaling or gene expression state-space of cancer\ntriggering processes. A class of these patterns, strange attractors, may be\nmathematical biomarkers of cancer progression. The emergence of intracellular\nchaos and chaotic cell population dynamics remains a new paradigm in systems\noncology. As such, chaotic and complex dynamics are discussed as mathematical\nhallmarks of cancer cell fate dynamics herein. Given the assumption that\ntime-resolved single-cell datasets are made available, a survey of\ninterdisciplinary tools and algorithms from complexity theory, are hereby\nreviewed to investigate critical phenomena and chaotic dynamics in cancer\necosystems. To conclude, the perspective cultivates an intuition for\ncomputational systems oncology in terms of nonlinear dynamics, information\ntheory, inverse problems and complexity. We highlight the limitations we see in\nthe area of statistical machine learning but the opportunity at combining it\nwith the symbolic computational power offered by the mathematical tools\nexplored.\n",

Despite this progress, there are still many obstacles to\nfully understanding how radiation interacts with biologically relevant cellular\ncomponents to form observable endpoints. One hurdle is the difficulty faced by\nmembers of different research groups in directly comparing results. Multiple\nMonte Carlo codes have been developed to simulate damage induction at the DNA\nscale, while at the same time various groups have developed models that\ndescribe DNA repair processes with varying levels of detail. These repair\nmodels are intrinsically linked to the damage model employed in their\ndevelopment, making it difficult to disentangle systematic effects in either\npart of the modelling chain. The modelling chain typically consists of track\nstructure Monte Carlo simulations of the physics interactions creating direct\ndamages to the DNA; followed by simulations of the production and initial\nreactions of chemical species causing indirect damages. After the DNA damage\ninduction, DNA repair models combine the simulated damage patterns with\nbiological models to determine the biological consequences of the damage. We\npropose a new Standard data format for DNA Damage to unify the interface\nbetween the simulation of damage induction and the biological modelling of cell\nrepair processes. Such a standard greatly facilitates inter model comparisons,\nproviding an ideal environment to tease out model assumptions and identify\npersistent, underlying mechanisms. Through inter model comparisons, this\nunified standard has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the\nunderlying mechanisms of radiation induced DNA damage and the resulting\nobservable biological effects.\n",

Composite static and phenomenological descriptions,\nwhile appearing complicated, lack the essence of what makes the biological\nsystems truly \"complex\".\n  The formalization of system-level problems is therefore important in\nconstructing a meta-theory of biology.

The non-structural proteins (nsps) avail\nhost protein synthesis machinery to initiate viral replication, along with\nneutralization of host immune defense. The key protein out of the 16 nsps, is\nthe non-structural protein nsp1, also known as the leader protein. Nsp1 leads\nthe process of hijacking host resources by blocking host translation. This\npaper concentrates on the analysis of nsps of SARS covid (CoV-2, CoV) and MERS\ncovid based on Cellular Automata enhanced Machine Learning (CAML) model\ndeveloped for study of biological strings. This computational model compares\ndeviation of structure - function of CoV-2 from that of CoV employing CAML\nmodel parameters derived out of CA evolution of amino acid chains of nsps. This\ncomparative analysis points to - (i) higher transmissibility of CoV-2 compared\nto CoV for major nsps, and (ii) deviation of MERS covid from SARS CoV in\nrespect of virulence and pathogenesis. A Machine Learning (ML) framework has\nbeen designed to map the CAML model parameters to the physical domain features\nreported in in-vitro/in-vivo/in-silico experimental studies.

The Clinical Data Interchange Standards\nConsortium (CDISC) data standards are well understood by the pharmaceutical\nindustry but lack the implementation of some paediatric specific concepts. When\na paediatric concept is absent within CDISC standards, companies and research\ninstitutions take multiple approaches in the collection of paediatric data,\nleading to different implementations of standards and potentially limited\nutility for reuse. To overcome these challenges, the conect4children consortium\nhas developed a cross-cutting paediatric data dictionary (CCPDD). The\ndictionary was built over three phases - scoping (including a survey sent out\nto ten industrial and 34 academic partners to gauge interest), creation of a\nlonglist and consensus building for the final set of terms. The dictionary was\nfinalized during a workshop with attendees from academia, hospitals, industry\nand CDISC. The attendees held detailed discussions on each data item and\nparticipated in the final vote on the inclusion of the item in the CCPDD. Nine\nindustrial and 34 academic partners responded to the survey, which showed\noverall interest in the development of the CCPDD. Following the final vote on\n27 data items, three were rejected, six were deferred to the next version and a\nfinal opinion was sought from CDISC. The first version of the CCPDD with 25\ndata items was released in August 2019. The continued use of the dictionary has\nthe potential to ensure the collection of standardized data that is\ninteroperable and can later be pooled and reused for other applications. The\ndictionary is already being used for case report form creation in three\nclinical trials. The CCPDD will also serve as one of the inputs to the\nPaediatric User Guide, which is being developed by CDISC.\n",

        "summary": "  The objective of this project is to develop an automated device used to spot\nprotein samples on a hydrophobic membrane to be used for the patented\nelectrophoresis method developed by Chang and Yonan in 2008 [1]. This novel\nmethod performs electrophoresis directly on hydrophobic blot membranes as\nopposed to the previous popular methods such as the 2-D polyacrylamide gel\nmethod [2, 3]. This new electrophoresis method significantly reduces the\nprocessing time to about 40 minutes, as opposed to the 2-D PAGE method which\ncan take one or two days. Special methods to spot samples on hydrophobic blot\nmembranes were established for successful separation of protein and protein\ncomplexes. These spotting methods are used in conjunction with the patented\nelectrophoresis method [1] for effective separation. The automated device\neffectively replicates these special methods that are repeatable and user\nindependent. The goal of the automated device is to effectively spot and\nseparate protein complexes in addition to single proteins under non-denaturing\nconditions, thus eliminating the variability of the manual spotting method.\n",

On the other hand, carotenoids (\\b{eta} carotene) are the most popular\nnatural pigments which play an important role to protect the plants from\nphoto-oxidative reactions. In human, these compounds prevent oxidative stress\nand expects to have antimicrobial activity. Here, the phenolic compounds were\nextracted with Ethyl acetate from fruiting bodies of Suillus sp and analyzed by\nHPLC, the antioxidant activity (reducing power%) of phenolic compounds was\ndetermined at the concentrations of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL. Antimicrobial activity\nof \\b{eta} carotene pigment was measured at a concentration of 100 mg/mL\nagainst some human pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas\naeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Staphylococcus aureus. The specific DNA\nregion ITS was amplified and sequenced using ITS1 and ITS4 primers with some\nbioinformatics analyses. The phenolic extract isolated from fruiting bodies of\nSuillus sp showed a remarkable antioxidant activity by increasing the reducing\npower percent (from F+3 ions to F+2 ions) comparing with the industrial\nantioxidant (Propyl gallate) at all used concentrations. Percent of reducing\npower of phenolic compounds were 75.5, 84.9 and 95.7% at concentrations of 1,\n2.5, and 5 mg/mL respectively; comparing with PG were 65.9, 81.3, and 93.3 at\n1, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL respectively. The \\b{eta} carotene pigment revealed a\nsignificant antimicrobial activity at a concentration of 100 mg/mL against K.\npneumonia, E. coli, and S. aureus.\n",

However, despite a variety of\neducational efforts, learning to write code can be a challenging endeavor for\nboth researchers and students in life science disciplines. Recent advances in\nartificial intelligence have made it possible to translate human-language\nprompts to functional code, raising questions about whether these technologies\ncan aid (or replace) life scientists' efforts to write code. Using 184\nprogramming exercises from an introductory-bioinformatics course, we evaluated\nthe extent to which one such model -- OpenAI's ChatGPT -- can successfully\ncomplete basic- to moderate-level programming tasks. On its first attempt,\nChatGPT solved 139 (75.5%) of the exercises. For the remaining exercises, we\nprovided natural-language feedback to the model, prompting it to try different\napproaches. Within 7 or fewer attempts, ChatGPT solved 179 (97.3%) of the\nexercises. These findings have important implications for life-sciences\nresearch and education. For many programming tasks, researchers no longer need\nto write code from scratch. Instead, machine-learning models may produce usable\nsolutions. Instructors may need to adapt their pedagogical approaches and\nassessment techniques to account for these new capabilities that are available\nto the general public.\n",

We operationalize homeostasis as a\nmultivariate mean-reverting stochastic process. We hypothesize that biomarkers\nhave stable equilibrium values, but that deviations from equilibrium of each\nbiomarker affects other biomarkers through an interaction network - this\nprecludes univariate analysis. We therefore looked for age-related changes to\nhomeostasis using dynamic network stability analysis, which transforms observed\nbiomarker data into independent \"natural\" variables and determines their\nassociated recovery rates. Most natural variables remained near equilibrium and\nwere essentially constant in time. A small number of natural variables were\nunable to equilibrate due to a gradual drift with age in their homeostatic\nequilibrium, i.e. allostasis. This drift caused them to accumulate over the\nlifespan course and makes them natural aging variables. Their rate of\naccumulation was correlated with risk of adverse outcomes: death or dementia\nonset. We call this tendency for aging organisms to drift towards an\nequilibrium position of ever-worsening health \"mallostasis\". We demonstrate\nthat the effects of mallostasis on observed biomarkers are spread out through\nthe interaction network. This could provide a redundancy mechanism to preserve\nfunctioning until multi-system dysfunction emerges at advanced ages.\n",

However, current practices for describing these\nrelationships, such as drawing diagrams or graphs in a somewhat arbitrary\nmanner, limit our ability to integrate various aspects of the gene functions\nand view the genome holistically. To overcome these limitations, we need a more\nappropriate way to describe the intricate relationships between genes.\nInterestingly, category theory, an abstract field of mathematics seemingly\nunrelated to biology, has emerged as a powerful language for describing\nrelations in general. We propose that category theory could provide a framework\nfor unifying our knowledge of genes and their relationships.\n  As a starting point, we construct a category of genes, with its morphisms\nabstracting various aspects of the relationships betweens genes. These\nrelationships include, but not limited to, the order of genes on the\nchromosomes, the physical or genetic interactions, the signalling pathways, the\ngene ontology causal activity models (GO-CAM) and gene groups. Previously, they\nwere encoded by miscellaneous networks or graphs, while our work unifies them\nin a consistent manner as a category. By doing so, we hope to view the\nrelationships between genes systematically. In the long run, this paves a\npromising way for us to understand the fundamental principles that govern gene\nregulation and function.\n",

There is no doubt\nthat more and more people is going to suffer from diabetes, hence it is crucial\nto understand better its biological foundations.

The glycolysis occurs during feeding and it is stimulated by insulin. On\nthe other hand, the glucose synthesis arises during fasting and it is\nstimulated by glucagon.

This can give rise to HI, a manifestation of which is in\nthe form of a disease. We consider both deterministic and stochastic models of\ngene expression and suggest possible scenarios for the occurrence of HI in the\ntwo cases.

In physiologic\nsystems, these long-range correlations are altered with disease and aging. Such\ncorrelated fluctuations in living systems have been attributed to the\ninteraction of multiple control systems; however, the mechanisms underlying\nthis behavior remain unknown. Here, we show that a number of distinct classes\nof dynamical behaviors, including correlated fluctuations characterized by\n$1/f$-scaling of their power spectra, can emerge in networks of simple\nsignaling units. We find that under general conditions, complex dynamics can be\ngenerated by systems fulfilling two requirements: i) a ``small-world'' topology\nand ii) the presence of noise. Our findings support two notable conclusions:\nfirst, complex physiologic-like signals can be modeled with a minimal set of\ncomponents; and second, systems fulfilling conditions (i) and (ii) are robust\nto some degree of degradation, i.e., they will still be able to generate\n$1/f$-dynamics.\n",

The simulated height distributions are\nbimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants.

Some scholars have proposed that information\nshould provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that\nany behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism's survival must\nnecessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by\nproviding a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a\nparticular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a\nfood source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates\nthe statistical structure of the creature's world, the effects of the\ncreature's actions on that structure, and the creature's strategic decision\nprocess. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite\ndimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining\nthat reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of \"information\nstates\". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the\nperformance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other\ncandidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information\noptimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2.\nThe rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not\npredict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of\ndifferent strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment,\nin particular the variability of motion of the source. We conclude that there\nis no simple relationship between information and utility. Behavioral\noptimality does not imply information efficiency, nor is there a simple\ntradeoff between gaining information about a food source versus obtaining the\nfood itself.\n",

Without the benefits of replicates, controls, or\nhindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable\ndifferent indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are\nto missing subtle warning signs.

It is clear, that gene expression patterns cannot explain the\ndevelopment of the precise geometry of an organism and its parts in space.\nHere, we suggest a set of postulates and possible approaches for discovering\nthe correspondence between molecular biological information and its realization\nin a given geometry of an organism in space-time. First, we suggest that the\ngeometry of the organism and its parts is coded by a molecular code located on\nthe cell surfaces in such a way that, with each cell, there can be associated a\ncorresponding matrix, containing this code. As a particular model, we propose\ncoding by several types of oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates. Second,\nwe provide a notion of cell event, and suggest a description of development as\na tree of cell events, where under cell event we understand the changing of\ncell state, e.g. the processes of cell division, cell growth/death, shift or\ndifferentiation. Next we suggest describing these cell motion laws using the\nnotion of a \"morphogenetic field\", meaning by the field an object in an \"event\nspace\" over a \"cell space\", which govern the transformation of the coded\nbiological information into an instructive signal for a cell event for a given\ncell, depending on the position of a cell in the developing embryo. The matrix\non a cell surface will be changed after each cell event according to the\nrule(s) dictated by the morphogenetic field of an organism.

I advocate treating\nionic solutions in general as complex fluids, with microelements that are the\nsolutes and components of the solution.

From DNA sequences to folded protein structures, living cells,\nmicrobial communities and multicellular structures, the material configurations\nin biology can easily be distinguished from non-living material assemblies.\nThis is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves\nconstruct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not\nliving, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological\norganism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures.

To this end we performed experiments and validated the results on (1) a\nvery large set of small graphs, (2) a number of larger networks with different\ntopologies, and (3) biological networks from a widely studied and validated\ngenetic network (e.coli) as well as on a significant number of differentiating\n(Th17) and differentiated human cells from high quality databases (Harvard's\nCellNet) with results conforming to experimentally validated biological data.\nBased on these results we introduce a conceptual framework, a model-based\ninterventional calculus and a reprogrammability measure with which to steer,\nmanipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics of non- linear dynamical systems from\npartial and disordered observations. The method consists in finding and\napplying a series of controlled interventions to a dynamical system to estimate\nhow its algorithmic information content is affected when every one of its\nelements are perturbed. The approach represents an alternative to numerical\nsimulation and statistical approaches for inferring causal\nmechanistic/generative models and finding first principles. We demonstrate the\nframework's capabilities by reconstructing the phase space of some discrete\ndynamical systems (cellular automata) as case study and reconstructing their\ngenerating rules. We thus advance tools for reprogramming artificial and living\nsystems without full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic\nequations or probability distributions yielding a suite of universal and\nparameter-free algorithms of wide applicability ranging from causation,\ndimension reduction, feature selection and model generation.\n",

        "summary": "  Life is a complex biological phenomenon represented by numerous chemical,\nphysical and biological processes performed by a biothermodynamic\nsystem/cell/organism. Both living organisms and inanimate objects are subject\nto aging, a biological and physicochemical process characterized by changes in\nbiological and thermodynamic state. Thus, the same physical laws govern\nprocesses in both animate and inanimate matter. All life processes lead to\nchange of an organism's state. The change of biological and thermodynamic state\nof an organism in time underlies all of three kinds of aging (chronological,\nbiological and thermodynamic). Life and aging of an organism both start at the\nmoment of fertilization and continue through entire lifespan. Fertilization\nrepresents formation of a new organism. The new organism represents a new\nthermodynamic system. From the very beginning, it changes its state by changing\nthermodynamic parameters. The change of thermodynamic parameters is observed as\naging and can be related to change in entropy. Entropy is thus the parameter\nthat is related to all others and describes aging in the best manner. In the\nbeginning, entropy change appears as a consequence of accumulation of matter\n(growth). Later, decomposition and configurational changes dominate, as a\nconsequence of various chemical reactions (free radical, decomposition,\nfragmentation, accumulation of lipofuscin-like substances...).\n",

We first develop a highly general\nabstract model for the possible future lives that these agents may encounter as\na result of their decisions. In the context of these possible futures, we show\nthat the causal entropic principle, whereby agents follow behavioural rules\nthat maximise their entropy over all paths through the future, predicts many of\nthe observed features of social interactions between individuals in both human\nand animal groups. Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximise\ntheir future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group, and that this\ncohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the\ndistribution of the number of future paths that are possible. We derive social\ninteraction rules that are consistent with maximum-entropy group behaviour for\nboth discrete and continuous decision spaces. Our analysis further predicts\nthat social interactions are likely to be fundamentally based on Weber's law of\nresponse to proportional stimuli, supporting many studies that find a\nneurological basis for this stimulus-response mechanism, and providing a novel\nbasis for the common assumption of linearly additive 'social forces' in\nsimulation studies of collective behaviour.\n",

The simulated dataset included more than 3\nmillion genotype, environment and management scenarios. Random forests most\naccurately predicted maize yield and N loss at planting time, with a RRMSE of\n14% and 55%, respectively.

We argue that out of the three modelling activities\n-- (1) formulating models; (2) analysing models; and (3) fitting or comparing\nmodels to data -- inherent to mathematical biology, researchers currently focus\ntoo much on activity (2) at the cost of (1). This trend, we propose, can be\nreversed by realising that any given biological phenomena can be modelled in an\ninfinite number of different ways, through the adoption of an open/pluralistic\napproach. We explain the open approach using fish locomotion as a case study\nand illustrate some of the pitfalls -- universalism, creating models of models,\netc. -- that hinder mathematical biology. We then ask how we might rediscover a\nlost art: that of creative mathematical modelling.\n  This article is dedicated to the memory of Edmund Crampin.\n",

We\nwish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view\nof law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the\nvariability of the very \"contexts of life\": the interactions between organisms,\nbiological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically\nindeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the \"niches\"\nwhich constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the\nmathematical unprestatability of the \"phase space\" (space of possibilities), no\nlaws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence,\nfrom life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation\nand diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a\nnovel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be\ncarried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions\nof phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as\ninvariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of\nphysical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound\nbiological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of\n\"enablement\". This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a\ndifference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences\nwill allow us to stress that \"non conservation principles\" are at the core of\nevolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation\nprinciples as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry\nchanges in physics, will be discussed, and lead to \"extended criticality\" as a\nconceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.\n",

Therefore, only\nfrom the acquired observations should state vectors reconstructed to emulate\nthe different states of the underlying system. It is what is known as the\nreconstruction of the state space, called phase space in real-world signals,\nfor now only satisfactorily resolved using the method of delays. Each state\nvector consists of m components, extracted from successive observations delayed\na time t. The morphology of the geometric structure described by the state\nvectors, as well as their properties, depends on the chosen parameters t and m.\nThe real dynamics of the system under study is subject to the correct\ndetermination of the parameters t and m. Only in this way can be deduced\ncharacteristics with true physical meaning, revealing aspects that reliably\nidentify the dynamic complexity of the physiological system. The biological\nsignal presented in this work, as a case study, is the PhotoPlethysmoGraphic\n(PPG) signal. We find that m is five for all the subjects analyzed and that t\ndepends on the time interval in which it evaluates.

A question then arises: How\nwell-duplexed are these two \"codes\"?

A recent paper by the first author\naddressed this question using two different methods. After reviewing those\nresults, this paper addresses the same question with a third method: the use of\nMonte Carlo and Gaussian sampling methods to approximate a multi-integral\nrepresenting the mutual information of a variety of possible genetic codes.\nOnce again, it is found that the genetic code used in nuclear DNA has a\nslightly lower than average duplexing efficiency as compared with other\nhypothetical genetic codes.

In this pilot study,\nmultiple Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the EVs extracted\nfrom the blood sera of 9 patients consisting of four different cancer subtypes\n(colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and pancreatic\ncancer) and five healthy patients (controls). FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared)\nspectroscopy measurements were performed as a complementary approach to Raman\nanalysis, on two of the four cancer subtypes. The AdaBoost Random Forest\nClassifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) distinguished the\nbaseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs from those of healthy controls\n(18 spectra) with a classification accuracy of above 90 percent when reduced to\na spectral frequency range of 1800 to 1940 inverse cm and subjected to a 50:50\ntraining: testing split.

Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives,\nburn no more calories each day than western populations living in labour-saving\nenvironments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other\nanimals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in\nexercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases\nin daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals\nexhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating\nsome of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by\ndecreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy\ncompensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But\nthe processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy\ncompensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how\nenergy compensation is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant\nexercise intervention studies, for both humans and other species, indicates\nconflict regarding the role that basal metabolic rate (BMR) or low level\nactivity such as fidgeting play, if any, particularly once changes in body\ncomposition are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity\nare not major components of energy compensation, what then drives it? I discuss\nhow changes in mitochondrial efficiency and changes in circadian fluctuations\nin BMR may contribute to our understanding of energy management.

        "summary": "  Current progress in the artificial intelligence domain has led to the\ndevelopment of various types of AI-powered dementia assessments, which can be\nemployed to identify patients at the early stage of dementia. It can\nrevolutionize the dementia care settings. It is essential that the medical\ncommunity be aware of various AI assessments and choose them considering their\ndegrees of validity, efficiency, practicality, reliability, and accuracy\nconcerning the early identification of patients with dementia (PwD). On the\nother hand, AI developers should be informed about various non-AI assessments\nas well as recently developed AI assessments. Thus, this paper, which can be\nreadable by both clinicians and AI engineers, fills the gap in the literature\nin explaining the existing solutions for the recognition of dementia to\nclinicians, as well as the techniques used and the most widespread dementia\ndatasets to AI engineers. It follows a review of papers on AI and non-AI\nassessments for dementia to provide valuable information about various dementia\nassessments for both the AI and medical communities. The discussion and\nconclusion highlight the most prominent research directions and the maturity of\nexisting solutions.\n",

Beyond human-AI chat, large language models (LLMs) are emerging in\nprogramming, algorithm discovery, and theorem proving, yet their genomics\napplication is limited. This project introduces Math Agents and mathematical\nembedding as fresh entries to the \"Moore's Law of Mathematics\", using a\nGPT-based workflow to convert equations from literature into LaTeX and Python\nformats. While many digital equation representations exist, there's a lack of\nautomated large-scale evaluation tools. LLMs are pivotal as linguistic user\ninterfaces, providing natural language access for human-AI chat and formal\nlanguages for large-scale AI-assisted computational infrastructure. Given the\ninfinite formal possibility spaces, Math Agents, which interact with math,\ncould potentially shift us from \"big data\" to \"big math\". Math, unlike the more\nflexible natural language, has properties subject to proof, enabling its use\nbeyond traditional applications like high-validation math-certified icons for\nAI alignment aims. This project aims to use Math Agents and mathematical\nembeddings to address the ageing issue in information systems biology by\napplying multiscalar physics mathematics to disease models and genomic data.\nGenerative AI with episodic memory could help analyse causal relations in\nlongitudinal health records, using SIR Precision Health models.

In this study, bioplastic films based on two different\npolysaccharides such as bitter cassava starch and chitosan extracted from crab\nshells were produced by casting technique, using glycerol as plasticizer. The\npurposes of this research are to characterize and to figure out the effect of\nadditional chitosan concentrations (0; 10; 20; 30; 50% by weight of starch) on\nthe physicochemical, mechanical and water barrier properties of bioplastic\nfilms. The film's solubility in water (S), water absorption capacity (WAP),\nwater vapor permeability (WVP), tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (E),\nYoung's modulus (YM) and biodegradability were investigated. The possible\ninteractions between starch and chitosan molecules were evaluated by Fourier\ntransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From the analysis, the incorporation of\nthe chitosan shows improved results on the water barrier properties of the\nbioplastic films. Optimum solubility in water, water absorption capacity, and\nwater vapor permeability are obtained on the composition of starch/chitosan was\n50/50. Actually, the addition of chitosan increased tensile strength, and\nelongation at break. The characterization of optimum mechanical proprieties\nalso occurred on the 50/50 composition of cassava-starch and chitosan. At this\nratio, tensile strength obtained were 6,3000 MPa; and the elongation at break\nwere 62,8571%. It was found that cassava-starch/chitosan-based films have a\nstable structure compared to native cassava-starch films.\n",

However, traditional liver parenchymal\nsegmentation techniques often face several challenges in performing liver\nsegmentation: lack of precision, slow processing speed, and computational\nburden. These shortcomings limit the efficiency of surgical planning and\nexecution. In this work, the model initially describes in detail a new image\nenhancement algorithm that enhances the key features of an image by adaptively\nadjusting the contrast and brightness of the image. Then, a deep learning-based\nsegmentation network was introduced, which was specially trained on the\nenhanced images to optimize the detection accuracy of tumor regions. In\naddition, multi-scale analysis techniques have been incorporated into the\nstudy, allowing the model to analyze images at different resolutions to capture\nmore nuanced tumor features. In the presentation of the experimental results,\nthe study used the 3Dircadb dataset to test the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional image\nsegmentation method, the new method using image enhancement technology has\nsignificantly improved the accuracy and recall rate of tumor identification.\n",

Multifractal\nspectra were determined using two types of box-counting coverage, revealing\nslight variations across most chromosomes. While the geometric support remained\nconsistent, distinct distributions were observed for each chromosome.\nChromosomes 9 and Y exhibited the greatest differences in singularity (H\\\"older\nexponent), with minor variations in their fractal support.

Using the complete assembly as a reference, we compared two\nalternative representations: the Binary Genomic Representation (RGB) and the\nMarkov Chain (MC) representation. Both methods tended toward the same fractal\nsupport but displayed differing distributions based on the assigned length\nparameter. Multifractal analysis highlighted quantitative differences between\nthese representations: RGB aligned more closely with high-frequency components,\nwhile MC showed better correspondence with low frequencies.

That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural\nproperties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might\nshare the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.\n  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components\nbuilt from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the\nConservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical\nmechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous\nand homogeneous. Heterogeneous systems contain components built from a unique\nalphabet of tokens and yield an implicit CoHSI distribution with a sharp\nunimodal peak asymptoting to a power-law. Homogeneous systems contain\ncomponents each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and\nyield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.\n  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer\nsoftware, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the\nelements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour\nco-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts). In\neach case, the predictions of the theory are tested and supported to high\nlevels of statistical significance. We also show that in the same heterogeneous\nsystem, different but consistent alphabets must be related by a power-law. We\ndemonstrate this on a large body of music by excluding and including note\nduration in the definition of the unique alphabet of notes.\n",
