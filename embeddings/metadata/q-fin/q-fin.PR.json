We then illustrate how option prices\nbased on such processes differ from Black and Scholes', in that option prices\ncan be either arbitrarily close to the option intrinsic value or arbitrarily\nclose to the underlying stock price. We also explain that this is due to the\nparticular way one models the stock-price process in between the grid time\ninstants which are relevant for trading. The theoretical result concerning\nscalar stochastic differential equations with prescribed diffusion coefficient\nwhose densities evolve in a prescribed exponential family, on which part of the\npaper is based, is presented in detail.\n",

The forecasts are derived from the process equations, and the\nparameters set a priori. An empirical analysis across multiple time horizons DT\nshows that a forecast provided by an I-GARCH(1) process (1 time scale) does not\ncapture correctly the dynamic of the realized volatility.

At the money (X= K) for American options, the expected payoff of\nboth the call and put options is zero. Shepp investigated several stochastic\noptimization problems using martingale and stopping time theories [2,5,6]. One\nof the problems he investigated was how to optimize the stock price using both\nthe Black-Scholes (multiplicative) and the Bachelier (additive) models [7,6]\nfor the American option above the strike price K (exercise price) to a stopping\npoint. In order to explore the non-relativistic quantum effect on the expected\npayoff for both the call and put options at the money, we assumed the stock\nprice to undergo a stochastic process governed by the Bachelier (additive)\nmodel [4]. Further, using Ito calculus and martingale theory, we obtained a\ndifferential equation for the expected payoff for both the call and put options\nin terms of delta and gamma. We also obtained the solution to the\nnon-relativistic Schroedinger equation as the expected payoff for both the call\nand put options. Then, we expressed the stochastic process that is the expected\npayoff for both the call and put options at the money in terms of the solution\nto the Schroedinger equation. We concluded the stochastic process that is the\nexpected payoff at the money for both options to be an oscillatory function\nwith quantized interest rates.\n",

They\nhave hence become interested in offsetting part of this exposure, namely buying\nback correlation. Two ways have been proposed for such a strategy : either pure\ncorrelation swaps or dispersion trades, taking position in an index option and\nthe opposite position in the components options. These dispersion trades have\nbeen set up using calls, puts, straddles, variance swaps as well as third\ngeneration volatility products. When considering a dispersion trade using\nvariance swaps, one immediately sees that it gives a correlation exposure.\nEmpirical analysis have showed that this implied correlation was not equal to\nthe strike of a correlation swap with the same maturity. The purpose of this\npaper is to theoretically explain such a spread. In fact, we prove that the P&L\nof a dispersion trade is equal to the sum of the spread between implied and\nrealised correlation - multiplied by an average variance of the components -\nand a volatility part. Furthermore, this volatility part is of second order,\nand, more precisely, is of volga order. Thus the observed correlation spread\ncan be totally explained by the volga of the dispersion trade. This result is\nto be reviewed when considering different weighting schemes for the dispersion\ntrade.\n",

The\nstochastic recovery specification only models the first two moments of the spot\nrecovery rate as its higher moments have almost no contribution to the loss\ndistribution and CDO tranche pricing. Observing that only the joint\ndistribution of default indicators is needed to build the portfolio loss\ndistribution, we propose a generic class of default indicator copulas to model\nCDO tranches, which can be easily calibrated to index tranche prices across\nmultiple maturities. This correlation modelling framework has the unique\nadvantage that the joint distribution of default time and other dynamic\nproperties of the model can be changed separately from the loss distribution\nand tranche prices. After calibrating the model to index tranche prices,\nexisting top-down methods can be applied to the common factor process to\nconstruct very flexible systemic dynamics without changing the already\ncalibrated tranche prices. This modelling framework therefore combines the best\nfeatures of the bottom-up and top-down models: it is fully consistent with all\nthe single name market information and it admits very rich and flexible spread\ndynamics. Numerical results from a non-parametric implementation of this\nmodelling framework are also presented. The non-parametric implementation\nachieved fast and accurate calibration to the index tranches across multiple\nmaturities even under extreme market conditions. A conditional Markov chain\nmethod is also proposed to construct the systemic dynamics, which supports an\nefficient lattice pricing method for dynamic spread instruments. We also showed\nhow to price tranche options as an example of this fast lattice method.\n",

        "summary": "  In financial markets, the information that traders have about an asset is\nreflected in its price. The arrival of new information then leads to price\nchanges. The `information-based framework' of Brody, Hughston and Macrina (BHM)\nisolates the emergence of information, and examines its role as a driver of\nprice dynamics. This approach has led to the development of new models that\ncapture a broad range of price behaviour. This thesis extends the work of BHM\nby introducing a wider class of processes for the generation of the market\nfiltration. In the BHM framework, each asset is associated with a collection of\nrandom cash flows. The asset price is the sum of the discounted expectations of\nthe cash flows. Expectations are taken with respect (i) an appropriate measure,\nand (ii) the filtration generated by a set of so-called information processes\nthat carry noisy or imperfect market information about the cash flows. To model\nthe flow of information, we introduce a class of processes termed L\\'evy random\nbridges (LRBs), generalising the Brownian and gamma information processes of\nBHM. Conditioned on its terminal value, an LRB is identical in law to a L\\'evy\nbridge. We consider in detail the case where the asset generates a single cash\nflow $X_T$ at a fixed date $T$. The flow of information about $X_T$ is modelled\nby an LRB with random terminal value $X_T$. An explicit expression for the\nprice process is found by working out the discounted conditional expectation of\n$X_T$ with respect to the natural filtration of the LRB. New models are\nconstructed using information processes related to the Poisson process, the\nCauchy process, the stable-1/2 subordinator, the variance-gamma process, and\nthe normal inverse-Gaussian process. These are applied to the valuation of\ncredit-risky bonds, vanilla and exotic options, and non-life insurance\nliabilities.\n",

However, advances in\ncommunication technology means that the 'lifetime' of important information is\ntypically short. Hence, viewed as a tradable asset, information shares the\ncharacteristics of a perishable commodity: while it can be stored and\ntransmitted freely, its worth diminishes rapidly in time. In view of recent\ndevelopments where internet search engines and other information providers are\noffering information to financial institutions, the problem of pricing\ninformation is becoming increasingly important. With this in mind, a new\nformulation of utility-indifference argument is introduced and used as a basis\nfor pricing information. Specifically, we regard information as a quantity that\nconverts a prior distribution into a posterior distribution. The amount of\ninformation can then be quantified by relative entropy. The key to our utility\nindifference argument is to equate the maximised a posterior utility, after\npaying certain cost for the information, with the a posterior expectation of\nthe utility based on the a priori optimal strategy. This formulation leads to\none price for a given quantity of upside information; and another price for a\ngiven quantity of downside information. The ideas are illustrated by means of\nsimple examples.\n",

In our approach, the two sides of the stylized balance sheet of\na firm, namely the asset value and debt value, are assumed to follow a two\ndimensional Markov process. Amongst models of this type we find examples that\nlead to derivative pricing formulas that are capable of reproducing the main\nfeatures of well known equity models such as the variance gamma model, and at\nthe same time reproducing the stylized facts about default stemming from\nstructural models of credit risk. Moreover, in contrast to one-factor\nstructural models, these models allow for much more flexible dependence between\nequity and credit markets. Two main technical obstacles to efficient\nimplementation of these pricing formulas are overcome in our paper. The first\nobstacle stems from the barrier condition implied by the non-default of the\nfirm, and is overcome by the idea of time-changing Brownian motion in a way\nthat preserves the reflection principle for Brownian motion. The second\nobstacle is the difficulty of computing spread options: this is overcome by\nusing results in recent papers that make efficient use of the two dimensional\nFast Fourier Transform.\n",

As merit\norder dynamics and fuel forward prices are embedded into the model, we capture\na much richer and more realistic dependence structure than can be achieved by\nclassical reduced-form models. We illustrate these advantages by comparing with\nMargrabe's formula and a simple cointegration model, and highlight important\nimplications for the valuation of power plants.\n",

We develop new closed-form spectral expansions for pricing such\noptions under a class of nonlinear volatility diffusion processes which\nincludes the constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) model as an example. In\nparticular, we derive a general analytically exact expression for the resolvent\nkernel (i.e. Green's function) of such processes with killing at an exponential\nstopping time (independent of the process) of occupation above or below a fixed\nlevel. Moreover, we succeed in Laplace inverting the resolvent kernel and\nthereby derive newly closed-form spectral expansion formulae for the transition\nprobability density of such processes with killing. The spectral expansion\nformulae are rapidly convergent and easy-to-implement as they are based simply\non knowledge of a pair of fundamental solutions for an underlying solvable\ndiffusion process. We apply the spectral expansion formulae to the pricing of\nproportional step options for four specific families of solvable nonlinear\ndiffusion asset price models that include the CEV diffusion model and three\nother multi-parameter state-dependent local volatility confluent hypergeometric\ndiffusion processes.\n",

This allows to reconcile single name and\nindex/basket volatility smiles in a consistent framework. Our approach could be\ndubbed a multidimensional local volatility approach with vector-state dependent\ndiffusion matrix. The model is quite tractable, leading to a complete market\nand not requiring Fourier techniques for calibration and dependence measures,\ncontrary to multivariate stochastic volatility models such as Wishart. We prove\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions for the model stochastic differential\nequations, provide formulas for a number of basket options, and analyze the\ndependence structure of the model in detail by deriving a number of results on\ncovariances, its copula function and rank correlation measures and\nvolatilities-assets correlations. A comparison with sampling simply-correlated\nsuitably discretized one-dimensional mixture dynamical paths is made, both in\nterms of option pricing and of dependence, and first order expansion\nrelationships between the two models' local covariances are derived. We also\nshow existence of a multivariate uncertain volatility model of which our\nmultivariate local volatilities model is a Markovian projection, highlighting\nthat the projected model is smoother and avoids a number of drawbacks of the\nuncertain volatility version. We also show a consistency result where the\nMarkovian projection of a geometric basket in the multivariate model is a\nunivariate mixture dynamics model.

The\ninterest rate, drift, volatility and intensities fluctuate over time and, in\nparticular, they depend on the state (regime) of the economy which is modelled\nby the multivariate counting process. Hence, we can allow for stressed market\nconditions. We assume that the trajectory of the risky asset is continuous\nbetween the transition times for the states of the economy and that the value\nof the risky asset jumps at the time of the transition. We find the hedging\nstrategy which minimizes the instantaneous mean-variance risk of the hedger's\nsurplus and we set the price so that the instantaneous Sharpe ratio of the\nhedger's surplus equals a predefined target. We use Backward Stochastic\nDifferential Equations. Interestingly, the instantaneous mean-variance hedging\nand instantaneous Sharpe ratio pricing can be related to no-good-deal pricing\nand robust pricing and hedging under model ambiguity.

Thus, taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an\nimportant issue. This issue has been dealt with, to some extent, for illiquid\nmarkets by assuming a continuous process, mainly based on the Brownian motion.\nHowever, the recent financial crisis and its effects on the global stock\nmarkets have propagated the urgent need for more realistic models where the\nstochastic process describing the price trajectories involves random jumps.\nNonetheless, works related to markets with jumps are scant compared to the\ncontinuous ones. In addition, these previous studies do not deal with illiquid\nmarkets.

We describe the Treasury funding problem and optimize against\nboth measures, using the Regulatory requirement as a constraint. We develop\ntheoretically optimal strategies for Q and P, then demonstrate a combined\napproach in four markets (USD, JPY, EUR, GBP). Since we deal with physical\nmeasures we develop appropriate statistical tests, and demonstrate highly\nsignificant (p<0.00001), out-of-sample, improvements on hedged funding with a\ncombined approach achieving 44% to 71% of a perfect information criterion.

For the\ncancellable drawdown insurance, we derive the investor's optimal cancellation\ntiming in terms of a two-sided first passage time of the underlying drawdown\nprocess.

We parametrize such\nrisk aversion in terms of three coefficients: convexity, skew and kurtosis risk\npremium. We propose that option prices under the real-world measure are not\nmartingales, but that their drift is governed by such tail risk premia. We then\nderive a fair-pricing equation for options and show that the solutions can be\nwritten in terms of a stochastic volatility model in continuous time and under\na martingale probability measure. This gives a precise connection between the\npricing and real-world probability measures, which cannot be obtained using\nGirsanov Theorem. We find that the convexity risk premium, not only shifts the\noverall implied volatility level, but also changes its term structure.\nMoreover, the skew risk premium makes the skewness of the volatility smile\nsteeper than a pure historical estimate. We derive analytical formulas for\ncertain implied moments using the Bergomi-Guyon expansion. This allows for very\nfast calibrations of the models.

Often, such contracts specify that the holder\nexert control at a finite number of deterministic times. The existence of an\noptimal bang-bang control, an optimal control taking on only a finite subset of\nvalues from the admissible set, is a common assumption in the literature. In\nthis case, the numerical complexity of searching for an optimal control is\nconsiderably reduced. However, no rigorous treatment as to when an optimal\nbang-bang control exists is present in the literature. We provide the reader\nwith a bang-bang principle from which the existence of such a control can be\nestablished for contracts satisfying some simple conditions. The bang-bang\nprinciple relies on the convexity and monotonicity of the solution and is\ndeveloped using basic results in convex analysis and parabolic partial\ndifferential equations. We show that a guaranteed lifelong withdrawal benefit\n(GLWB) contract admits an optimal bang-bang control. In particular, we find\nthat the holder of a GLWB can maximize a writer's losses by only ever\nperforming nonwithdrawal, withdrawal at exactly the contract rate, or full\nsurrender. We demonstrate that the related guaranteed minimum withdrawal\nbenefit contract is not convexity preserving, and hence does not satisfy the\nbang-bang principle other than in certain degenerate cases.\n",

The surrender feature available in marketed\nproducts allows termination of the contract before maturity, making it also an\noptimal stopping problem. Although the surrender feature is quite common in\nvariable annuity contracts, there appears to be no published analysis and\nresults for this feature in GMWB under optimal policyholder behaviour - results\nfound in the literature so far are consistent with the absence of such a\nfeature. Also, it is of practical interest to see how the much simpler\nbang-bang strategy, although not optimal for GMWB, compares with optimal GMWB\nstrategy with surrender option.\n  In this paper we extend our recently developed algorithm (Luo and Shevchenko\n2015a) to include surrender option in GMWB and compare prices under different\npolicyholder strategies: optimal, static and bang-bang. Results indicate that\nfollowing a simple but sub-optimal bang-bang strategy does not lead to\nsignificant reduction in the price or equivalently in the fee, in comparison\nwith the optimal strategy. We observed that the extra value added by the\nsurrender option could add very significant value to the GMWB contract. We also\nperformed calculations for static withdrawal with surrender option, which is\nthe same as bang-bang minus the \"no-withdrawal\" choice. We find that the fee\nfor such contract is only less than 1% smaller when compared to the case of\nbang-bang strategy, meaning that th \"no-withdrawal\" option adds little value to\nthe contract.\n",

Under optimal withdrawal\npolicyholder behaviour the pricing of such a product is an optimal stochastic\ncontrol problem that cannot be solved using Monte Carlo method. In low\ndimension case, it can be solved using PDE based methods such as finite\ndifference. In this paper, we develop a much more efficient Gauss-Hermite\nquadrature method with a one-dimensional cubic spline for calculation of the\nexpectation between withdrawal/reset dates, and a bi-cubic spline interpolation\nfor applying the jump conditions across withdrawal/reset dates. We show results\nfor both static and dynamic withdrawals and for both the asset accumulation and\nthe pension phases (different penalties for any excessive withdrawal) in the\nretirement investment cycle. To evaluate products with capital protection\noption, it is common industry practice to assume static withdrawals and use\nMonte Carlo method. As a result, the fair fee is underpriced if policyholder\nbehaves optimally. We found that extra fee that has to be charged to counter\nthe optimal policyholder behaviour is most significant at smaller interest rate\nand higher volatility levels, and it is sensitive to the penalty threshold. At\nlow interest rate and a moderate penalty threshold level (15% of the portfolio\nvalue per annum) typically set in practice, the extra fee due to optimal\nwithdrawal can be as high as 40% and more on top of the base case of no\nwithdrawal or the case of fixed withdrawals at the penalty threshold.\n",

Using bond price as a numeraire the required expectations in the\nbackward recursion are reduced to two-dimensional integrals calculated through\na high order Gauss-Hermite quadrature applied on a two-dimensional cubic spline\ninterpolation. Numerical results from the new algorithm for a series of GMWB\ncontracts for both static and optimal cases are presented. As a validation,\nresults of the algorithm are compared with the closed form solutions for simple\nvanilla options, and with Monte Carlo and finite difference results for the\nstatic GMWB. The comparison demonstrates that the new algorithm is\nsignificantly faster than finite difference or Monte Carlo for all the\ntwo-dimensional problems tested so far. For dynamic GMWB pricing, we found that\nfor positive correlation between the underlying asset and interest rate, the\nGMWB price under the stochastic interest rate is significantly higher compared\nto the case of deterministic interest rate, while for negative correlation the\ndifference is less but still significant.\n",

Two Brownian motions drive moves across the forward\ncurve, with a third Heston-like stochastic volatility process scaling\ninstantaneous volatilities of all forward prices.\n  In addition to an efficient numerical scheme for calculating European vanilla\nand early-exercise option prices, we describe an algorithm for Monte\nCarlo-based pricing of more generic derivative payoffs which involves an\nefficient approximation for the risk neutral drift that avoids having to\nsimulate drifts for every forward settlement date required for pricing.\n",

Employees were given the option to\nconvert from a defined contribution (DC) plan to a defined benefit (DB) plan at\na time of their choosing. The cost of the switch was assessed in terms of the\nABO (Accrued Benefit Obligation), which is the expected present value of the\naccrued DB pension at the time of the switch. If the ABO was greater than the\nDC account, the employee was required to fund the difference.\n  The second is the DB Underpin option, also known as a floor offset, under\nwhich the employee participates in a DC plan, but with a guaranteed minimum\nbenefit based on a traditional DB formula.\n  The third option can be considered a variation on each of the first two. We\nremove the requirement from the FSE option for employees to fund any shortfall\nat the switching date. The resulting option is very similar to the DB underpin,\nbut with the possibility of early exercise. Since we assume that exercise is\nonly permitted at discrete, annual intervals, this option is a Bermudan\nvariation on the DB Underpin.\n  We adopt an arbitrage-free pricing methodology to value the option. We\nanalyse and value the optimal switching strategy for the employee by\nconstructing an exercise frontier, and illustrate numerically the difference\nbetween the FSE, DB Underpin and Bermudan DB Underpin options.\n",

Market models have more\nflexibility for fitting of curves than do SVMs, and therefore are better suited\nfor pricing VIX futures and VIX derivatives. But the VIX itself is a derivative\nof the S&P500 (SPX) and it is common practice to price SPX derivatives using an\nSVM. Therefore, consistent modeling for both SPX and VIX should involve an SVM\nthat can be obtained by inverting the market model. This paper's main result is\na method for the recovery of a stochastic volatility function by solving an\ninverse problem where the input is the VIX function given by a market model.\nAnalysis will show conditions necessary for there to be a unique solution to\nthis inverse problem. The models are consistent if the recovered volatility\nfunction is non-negative. Examples are presented to illustrate the theory, to\nhighlight the issue of negativity in solutions, and to show the potential for\ninconsistency in non-Markov settings.\n",

Our model directly targets the instantaneous variance of a\nrisky asset and consists of a generalized fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\ndriven by a L\\'{e}vy subordinator and an independent sinusoidal-composite\nL\\'{e}vy process. The former component captures short-term dependence in the\ninstantaneous volatility, while the latter is introduced expressly for\nrectifying the activity level of the average forward variance. Such a framework\nensures that the characteristic function of average forward variance is\nobtainable in semi-closed form, without having to invoke any geometric-mean\napproximations. To analyze swaps and European-style options on average forward\nvolatility, we introduce a general class of power-type derivatives on the\naverage forward variance, which also provide flexible nonlinear leverage\nexposure. Pricing-hedging formulae are based on a modified numerical Fourier\ntransform technique. A comparative empirical study is conducted on two\nindependent recent data sets on VIX options, before and during the COVID-19\npandemic, to demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly amenable to\nefficient model calibration under various choices of kernels.\n",

Funding costs and specific close-out procedures at default break the\nbilateral nature of the deal price and render the valuation problem a\nnon-linear and recursive one. CVA and FVA are in general not really additive\nadjustments, and the risk for double counting is concrete. We introduce a new\nadjustment, called a Non-linearity Valuation Adjustment (NVA), to address\ndouble-counting. The theoretical risk free rate disappears from our final\nequations. The framework can be tailored also to CCP trading under initial and\nvariation margins, as explained in detail in Brigo and Pallavicini (2014). In\nparticular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement\nclose-out and re-hypothecation. The valuation equation takes the form of a\nbackward stochastic differential equation or semi-linear partial differential\nequation, and can be cast as a set of iterative equations that can be solved by\nleast-squares Monte Carlo. We propose such a simulation algorithm in a case\nstudy involving a generalization of the benchmark model of Black and Scholes\nfor option pricing.

First, we give conditions on the seasonal term under which the\ncorresponding volatility factor is well-defined. These conditions appear to be\nrather mild. Second, we calculate the joint characteristic function of two\nfutures prices for different maturities in the proposed model. This\ncharacteristic function is analytic. Finally, we provide numerical\nillustrations in terms of implied volatility and correlation produced by the\nproposed model with five different specifications of the seasonality pattern.\nThe model is found to be able to produce volatility smiles at the same time as\na volatility term-structure that exhibits the Samuelson effect with a seasonal\ncomponent.

Here we study a multi-curve extension of short rate models\nwhere, in addition to the short rate itself, we introduce short rate spreads.\nIn particular, we consider a Gaussian factor model where the short rate and the\nspreads are second order polynomials of Gaussian factor processes. This leads\nto an exponentially quadratic model class that is less well known than the\nexponentially affine class. In the latter class the factors enter linearly and\nfor positivity one considers square root factor processes. While the square\nroot factors in the affine class have more involved distributions, in the\nquadratic class the factors remain Gaussian and this leads to various\nadvantages, in particular for derivative pricing. After some preliminaries on\nmartingale modeling in the multi-curve setup, we concentrate on pricing of\nlinear and optional derivatives. For linear derivatives, we exhibit an\nadjustment factor that allows one to pass from pre-crisis single curve values\nto the corresponding post-crisis multi-curve values.\n",

In the first part we consider the theory\nof time-inhomogeneous affine processes on general state spaces. We present a\nconcise setup for time-inhomogeneous Markov processes. For stochastically\ncontinuous affine processes we show that there always exists a c\\`adl\\`ag\nmodification. Afterwards we consider the regularity and the semimartingale\nproperty of affine processes. Contrary to the time-homogeneous case,\ntime-inhomogeneous affine processes are in general neither regular nor\nsemimartingales and the time-inhomogeneous case raises many new and interesting\nquestions. Assuming that an affine process is a semimartingale, we show that\neven without regularity the parameter functions satisfy generalized Riccati\nintegral equations. This generalizes an important result for time-homogeneous\naffine processes. We also show that stochastically continuous affine\nsemimartingales are essentially generated by deterministic time-changes of what\nwe call absolutely continuously affine semimartingales. These processes\ngeneralize time-homogeneous regular affine processes.\n  In the second part we consider the class of affine LIBOR market models. We\ncontribute to this class of models in two ways. First, we modify the original\nsetup of the affine LIBOR market models in such a way that next to nonnegative\naffine processes real-valued affine processes can also be used. Numerical\nexamples show that this allows for more flexible implied volatility surfaces.\nSecond, we introduce the class of affine inflation market models, an extension\nof the affine LIBOR market models. A calibration example shows that these\nmodels perform very well in fitting market-observed prices of inflation\nderivatives.\n",

In this situation currency fluctuations clearly introduce a\nsource of risk on CDS spreads. For emerging markets, but in some cases even in\nwell developed markets, the risk of dramatic Foreign Exchange (FX) rate\ndevaluation in conjunction with default events is relevant. We address this\nissue by proposing and implementing a model that considers the risk of foreign\ncurrency devaluation that is synchronous with default of the reference entity.\n  Preliminary results indicate that perceived risks of devaluation can induce a\nsignificant basis across domestic and foreign CDS quotes. For the Republic of\nItaly, a USD CDS spread quote of 440 bps can translate into a EUR quote of 350\nbps in the middle of the Euro-debt crisis in the first week of May 2012. More\nrecently, from June 2013, the basis spreads between the EUR quotes and the USD\nquotes are in the range around 40 bps.\n  We explain in detail the sources for such discrepancies. Our modeling\napproach is based on the reduced form framework for credit risk, where the\ndefault time is modeled in a Cox process setting with explicit diffusion\ndynamics for default intensity/hazard rate and exponential jump to default. For\nthe FX part, we include an explicit default-driven jump in the FX dynamics. As\nour results show, such a mechanism provides a further and more effective way to\nmodel credit / FX dependency than the instantaneous correlation that can be\nimposed among the driving Brownian motions of default intensity and FX rates,\nas it is not possible to explain the observed basis spreads during the\nEuro-debt crisis by using the latter mechanism alone.\n",

Barrier options are considered\nin the paper and semi-static hedges are studied and discussed for a fairly\nlarge class of underlying price dynamics. Timing risk is identified with the\nuncertainty associated to the time at which the payoff payment of the barrier\noption is due. Starting from the work by Carr and Picron (1999), where the\nauthors show that the timing risk can be hedged via static positions in plain\nvanilla options, the present paper extends the static hedge formula proposed in\nCarr and Picron (1999) by giving sufficient conditions to decompose a\ngeneralized timing risk into an integral of knock-in options in a\nmulti-dimensional market model. A dedicated study of the semi-static hedge is\nthen conducted by defining the corresponding strategy based on positions in\nbarrier options. The proposed methodology allows to construct not only first\norder hedges but also higher order semi-static hedges, that can be interpreted\nas asymptotic expansions of the hedging error. The convergence of these higher\norder semi-static hedges to an exact hedge is shown. An illustration of the\nmain theoretical results is provided for i) a symmetric case, ii) a one\ndimensional case, where the first order and second order hedging errors are\nderived in analytic closed form. The materiality of the hedging benefit gain of\ngoing from order one to order two by re-iterating the timing risk hedging\nstrategy is discussed through numerical evidences by showing that order two can\nbring to more than 90% reduction of the hedging 'cost' w.r.t. order one\n(depending on the specific barrier option characteristics).\n",

We show that the short-maturity smile scales in\nqualitatively the same way as a general rough stochastic volatility model (cf.\\\n\\cite{FZ17}, \\cite{FGP18a} et al.), and the rate function is equal to the\nFenchel-Legendre transform of a simple transformation of the solution to the\nsame Volterra integral equation (VIE) that appears in \\cite{ER19}, but with the\ndrift and mean reversion terms removed. The solution to this VIE satisfies a\nspace-time scaling property which means we only need to solve this equation for\nthe moment values of $p=1$ and $p=-1$ so the rate function can be efficiently\ncomputed using an Adams scheme or a power series, and we compute a power series\nin the log-moneyness variable for the asymptotic implied volatility which\nyields tractable expressions for the implied vol skew and convexity. The\nlimiting asymptotic smile in the large-maturity regime is obtained via a\nstability analysis of the fixed points of the VIE, and is the same as for the\nstandard Heston model in \\cite{FJ11}.

This model is an extension to L\\'evy driving processes of the\nclassical log-normal Libor market model (LMM) driven by a Brownian motion.\nOption pricing is significantly less tractable in this model than in the LMM\ndue to the appearance of stochastic terms in the jump part of the driving\nprocess when performing the measure changes which are standard in pricing of\ninterest rate derivatives. To obtain explicit approximation for option prices,\nwe propose to treat a given L\\'evy Libor model as a suitable perturbation of\nthe log-normal LMM. The method is inspired by recent works by Cern\\'y, Denkl\nand Kallsen (2013) and M\\'enass\\'e and Tankov (2015). The approximate option\nprices in the L\\'evy Libor model are given as the corresponding LMM prices plus\ncorrection terms which depend on the characteristics of the underlying L\\'evy\nprocess and some additional terms obtained from the LMM model.\n",

Consider a typical case of a bank hedging a client trade via a\nCCP. On client default the hedge (effects) will be removed (rebalanced). On the\nother hand, if the hedge counterparty defaults the hedge will be replaced. Thus\nif the hedge required initial margin then the default probability driving MVA\nis from the client not from the hedge counterparty. This is the opposite of\nusual assumptions where counterparty XVAs are computed independent of each\nother. Replacement of the hedge counterparty means multiple CVA costs on the\nhedge side need inclusion. Since hedge trades are generally at riskless mid (or\nworse) these costs are paid on the client side, and must be calculated before\nthe replacement hedge counterparties are known. We call these counterparties\nanonymous counterparties. The effects on CVA and MVA will generally be\nexclusive because MVA largely removes CVA, and CVA is hardly relevant for CCPs.\nEffects on KVA and FVA will resemble those on MVA. We provide a theoretical\nframework, including anonymous counterparties, and numerical examples. Pricing\nXVA by considering counterparties in isolation is inadequate and behaviour must\nbe taken into account.\n",

The supports of these\ndistributions are truncated in order to obtain finite values for the options.\nWithin this framework, options with different strikes and maturities for one\nstock rely on a single parameter -- the standard deviation of the Student's\nt-distribution for unit period. We provide a study which shows that the\ndistribution support width has weak influence on the option prices for certain\nrange of values of the width. It is furthermore shown that such family of\ntruncated distributions approximately satisfies the no-arbitrage principle and\nthe put-call parity. The relevance of the pricing procedure is empirically\nverified by obtaining remarkably good match of the numerically computed values\nby our scheme to real market data.\n",

We present a model that is consistent with\ntwo notions of volatility: a historical volatility consistent with statistical\nanalysis, and an implied volatility consistent with options priced with the\nmodel. The latter will be also the quadratic variation of the model, a pathwise\nproperty. This first result, originally presented in Brigo and Mercurio (1998,\n2000), is then connected with the recent work of Armstrong et al (2018, 2021),\nwhere using rough paths theory it is shown that implied volatility is\nassociated with a purely pathwise lift of the stock dynamics involving no\nprobability and no semimartingale theory in particular, leading to option\nmodels without probability. Finally, an intermediate result by Bender et al.\n(2008) is recalled. Using semimartingale theory, Bender et al. showed that one\ncould obtain option prices based only on the semimartingale quadratic variation\nof the model, a pathwise property, and highlighted the difference between\nhistorical and implied volatility. All three works confirm the idea that while\nhistorical volatility is a statistical quantity, implied volatility is a\npathwise one. This leads to a 20 years mini-anniversary of pathwise pricing\nthrough 1998, 2008 and 2018, which is rather fitting for a talk presented at\nthe conference for the 45 years of the Black, Scholes and Merton option pricing\nparadigm.\n",

The\nimpact of a non-exponential waiting time does not vanish with time and leads to\ndifferent distribution spread rates compared to standard models. In financial\nmodelling this has been used to accommodate for random trade duration in the\ntick-by-tick price process. We show here that anomalous diffusions are able to\nreproduce the market behaviour of the implied volatility more consistently than\nusual L\\'evy or stochastic volatility models. We focus on two distinct classes\nof underlying asset models, one with independent price innovations and waiting\ntimes, and one allowing dependence between these two components. These two\nmodels capture the well-known paradigm according to which shorter trade\nduration is associated with higher return impact of individual trades. We fully\ndescribe these processes in a semimartingale setting leading no-arbitrage\npricing formulae, and study their statistical properties. We observe that\nskewness and kurtosis of the asset returns do not tend to zero as time goes by.\nWe also characterize the large-maturity asymptotics of Call option prices, and\nfind that the convergence rate is slower than in standard L\\'evy regimes, which\nin turn yields a declining implied volatility term structure and a slower decay\nof the skew.\n",

To allow prior information about such a density to\nbe taken into account, we generalise the algorithm presented in Neri and\nSchneider (2011) to find the maximum entropy density of an asset price to the\nrelative entropy case. This is applied to study the impact the choice of prior\ndensity has in two market scenarios. In the first scenario, call option prices\nare prescribed at only a small number of strikes, and we see that the choice of\nprior, or indeed its omission, yields notably different densities. The second\nscenario is given by CBOE option price data for S&P500 index options at a large\nnumber of strikes. Prior information is now considered to be given by\ncalibrated Heston, Schoebel-Zhu or Variance Gamma models. We find that the\nresulting digital option prices are essentially the same as those given by the\n(non-relative) Buchen-Kelly density itself. In other words, in a sufficiently\nliquid market the influence of the prior density seems to vanish almost\ncompletely. Finally, we study variance swaps and derive a simple formula\nrelating the fair variance swap rate to entropy. Then we show, again, that the\nprior loses its influence on the fair variance swap rate as the number of\nstrikes increases.\n",

The most common practice to\ndeal with these issues is to use another similar or \"closely related\" asset or\nindex which is traded, for hedging purposes. Implicitly, traders assume here\nthat the higher the correlation between the traded and nontraded assets, the\nbetter the hedge is expected to perform. This raises the question as to how\n\\textquoteleft{}closely related\\textquoteright{} the assets really are. In this\npaper, the concept of twin assets is introduced, focusing the discussion\nprecisely in what does it mean for two assets to be similar. Our findings point\nto the fact that, in order to have very similar assets, for example identical\ntwins, high correlation measures are not enough. Specifically, two basic\ncriteria of similarity are pointed out: i) the coefficient of variation of the\nassets and ii) the correlation between assets. From here, a method to measure\nthe level of similarity between assets is proposed, and secondly, an option\npricing model of twin assets is developed. The proposed model allows us to\nprice an option of one nontraded asset using its twin asset, but this time\nknowing explicitly what levels of errors we are facing. Finally, some numerical\nillustrations show how twin assets behave depending upon their levels of\nsimilarities, and how their potential differences will traduce in MAPE (mean\nabsolute percentage error) for the proposed option pricing model.\n",

The pricing of\nsingle underlying European options on futures contracts is straightforward and\ncan incorporate the volatility smile or skew observed in the market. We\ncalculate the joint characteristic function of two futures contracts in the\nmodel in analytic form and use the one-dimensional Fourier inversion method of\nCaldana and Fusai (JBF 2013) to price calendar spread options. The model leads\nto stochastic correlation between the returns of two futures contracts. We\nillustrate the distribution of this correlation in an example.

However, recent changes in the\nregulatory regime and the increases in regulatory capital requirements has led\nmany banks to include the cost of capital in derivative pricing. This paper\nformalises the addition of cost of capital by extending the Burgard-Kjaer\n(2013) semi-replication approach to CVA and FVA to include an addition capital\nterm, Capital Valuation Adjustment (KVA, i.e. Kapital Valuation Adjustment to\ndistinguish from CVA.) The utilization of the capital for funding purposes is\nalso considered. The use of the semi-replication approach means that the\nflexibility around the treatment of self-default is carried over into this\nanalysis. The paper further considers the practical calculation of KVA with\nreference to the Basel II (BCBS-128) and Basel III (BCBS-189) capital regimes\nand their implementation via CRD IV. The paper also assesses how KVA may be\nhedged, given that any hedging transactions themselves lead to regulatory\ncapital requirements and hence capital costs. Finally a number of numerical\nexamples are presented to gauge the cost impact of KVA on vanilla derivative\nproducts.\n",

So far in the literature these contracts\nhave only been evaluated by solving partial differential equations (PDE) using\nthe finite difference method.

The price can then be\nexpressed as the solution of a system of non-linear partial differential\nequations. We reformulate the problem as a backward stochastic differential\nequation with jumps and solve it numerically by the use of efficient neural\nnetworks. Sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to initial parameters\nand an analysis of the accuracy of the approximation of the true price with our\nneural networks is provided.\n",

However, a growing body of studies\nsuggest that a simple GBM trajectory is not an adequate representation for\nasset dynamics due to irregularities found when comparing its properties with\nempirical distributions. As a solution, we develop a generalisation of GBM\nwhere the introduction of a memory kernel critically determines the behavior of\nthe stochastic process. We find the general expressions for the moments,\nlog-moments, and the expectation of the periodic log returns, and obtain the\ncorresponding probability density functions by using the subordination\napproach. Particularly, we consider subdiffusive GBM (sGBM), tempered sGBM, a\nmix of GBM and sGBM, and a mix of sGBMs. We utilise the resulting generalised\nGBM (gGBM) to examine the empirical performance of a selected group of kernels\nin the pricing of European call options. Our results indicate that the\nperformance of a kernel ultimately depends on the maturity of the option and\nits moneyness.\n",

In the current paper, we take the moment-matching\nmethodology in [5] a step further by obtaining a closed form solution for this\nnon-linear system of equations, by identifying a unary cubic equation based\nsolely on the basket's skewness, which parametrizes all model parameters, and\nwe use it to express the approximation formula as an explicit function of the\nmean, variance, and skewness of the basket.

An EPS is a standalone financial derivative,\nwhich is reminiscent of a total return swap but also shares some features with\nthe variable annuity known as the registered index-linked annuity (RILA). The\nbuyer of an EPS obtains partial protection against losses on a reference\nportfolio and, in exchange, agrees to share portfolio gains with the insurance\nprovider if the realized return on a reference portfolio is above a\npredetermined threshold. Formally, a generic EPS consists of protection and fee\nlegs with participation rates agreed upon by the provider and holder. A general\nfair pricing formula for an EPS is obtained by considering a static hedging\nstrategy based on traded European options. It is argued that to make the\ncontract appealing to holders, the provider should select appropriate\nprotection and fee rates that make the fair premium at the contract's inception\nequal to zero. A numerical study based on the Black-Scholes model and empirical\ntests based on market data for S\\&P~500 and S&P/ASX~200 indices for 2020-2022\ndemonstrates the benefits of an EPS as an efficient investment insurance tool\nfor superannuation accounts.\n",

By analyzing investor emotions expressed on\nStockTwits and Twitter, I find that emotions conveyed through these social\nmedia platforms can help explain the mispricing of IPO stocks. The abundance of\ninformation and opinions shared on social media can generate hype around\ncertain stocks, leading to investors' irrational buying and selling decisions.\nThis can result in an overvaluation of the stock in the short term but often\nleads to a correction in the long term as the stock's performance fails to meet\nthe inflated expectations. In particular, I find that IPOs with high levels of\npre-IPO enthusiasm tend to have a significantly higher first-day return of\n29.73%, compared to IPOs with lower levels of pre-IPO investor enthusiasm,\nwhich have an average first-day return of 17.59%.

Diving deeper into the qualitative\naspects of investor discourse, I find that messages rich in financial language\nor that bolster prevailing information drive my results. Additionally, a trend\ntowards caution emerges among users who frequently engage with IPOs, perhaps a\nbyproduct of lessons from past endeavors. Intriguingly, firms that enjoy high\nlevels of pre-IPO optimism consistently garner post-launch enthusiasm, a trend\nat odds with their long-term under-performance.\n",

        "summary": "  This research paper addresses the critical challenge of accurately valuing\npost-revenue drug assets in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, a key\nfactor influencing a wide range of strategic operations and investment\ndecisions. Recognizing the importance of reliable valuations for stakeholders\nsuch as pharmaceutical companies, venture capitalists, and private equity\nfirms, this study introduces a novel model for forecasting future sales of\npost-revenue biopharmaceutical assets. The proposed model leverages historical\nsales data, a resource known for its high quality and availability in company\nfinancial records, to produce distributional estimates of cumulative sales for\nindividual assets. These estimates are instrumental in calculating the Net\nPresent Value of each asset, thereby facilitating more informed and strategic\ninvestment decisions. A practical application of this model is demonstrated\nthrough its implementation in analyzing Pfizer's portfolio of post-revenue\nassets. This precision highlights the model's potential as a valuable tool in\nthe financial assessment and decision-making processes within the biotech and\npharmaceutical industries, offering a methodical approach to identifying\ninvestment opportunities and optimizing capital allocation.\n",

The\nvaluation framework is based on the cost of producing the liabilities to an\ninsurance company that is subject to solvency regulation (regulatory solvency\ncapital requirements) and insolvency laws (consequences of failure) in finite\ndiscrete time. Starting from the replication approach of classical no-arbitrage\ntheory, the framework additionally considers the nature and cost of capital\n(expressed by a ``financiability condition\"), that the liabilities may be\nrequired to be fulfilled only ``in sufficiently many cases\" (expressed by a\n``fulfillment condition\"), production using ``fully illiquid\" assets in\naddition to tradables, and the asymmetry between assets and liabilities. We\nidentify necessary and sufficient conditions on the capital investment under\nwhich the framework recovers the market prices of tradables, investigate\nextending production to take account of insolvency, implications of using\nilliquid assets in the production, and show how Solvency II and SST valuation\ncan be derived with specific assumptions.\n",

However, there is little consensus in\nthe literature regarding the existence of such a premium.

The pertinent question is whether more polluting firms give higher\nreturns or do firms with high returns have less incentive to decarbonize? In\nthis study, we investigate whether firms' emissions is causally linked to the\npresence of a carbon premium in a panel of 141 firms listed in the S\\&P500\nindex using fixed-effects analysis, with propensity score weighting to control\nfor selection bias in which firms increase their emissions.

We show that $v_t$ is\nthe unique solution to a one-dimensional diffusion process. Using the Feller\ntest, we show that $v_t$ explodes in finite time with non-zero probability. As\na consequence, VIX futures and VIX call prices are infinite, and VIX put prices\nare zero for any maturity. As a remedy, we propose a capped volatility process\nby capping the drift and diffusion terms in the $v_{t}$ process such that it\nbecomes non-explosive and well-behaved, and study the short-maturity\nasymptotics for the pricing of VIX options.\n",

Each cash flow is expressed as a function of one\nor more independent random variables called market factors or \"X-factors\". Each\nX-factor is associated with a \"market information process\", the values of which\nbecome available to market participants. In addition to true information about\nthe X-factor, the information process contains an independent \"noise\" term\nmodelled here by a Brownian bridge. The information process thus gives partial\ninformation about the X-factor, and the value of the market factor is only\nrevealed at the termination of the process. The market filtration is assumed to\nbe generated by the information processes associated with the X-factors. The\nprice of an asset is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the sum of the\ndiscounted cash flows, conditional on the information available from the\nfiltration. The theory is developed in some detail, with a variety of\napplications to credit risk management, share prices, interest rates, and\ninflation. A number of new exactly solvable models are obtained for the price\nprocesses of various types of assets and derivative securities; and a novel\nmechanism is proposed to account for the dynamics of stochastic volatility and\ndynamic correlation. A discrete-time version of the information-based framework\nis also developed, and is used to construct a new class of models for the real\nand nominal interest rate term structures, and the dynamics of the associated\nprice index.\n",

        "summary": "  It is commonly accepted that Commodities futures and forward prices, in\nprinciple, agree under some simplifying assumptions. One of the most relevant\nassumptions is the absence of counterparty risk. Indeed, due to margining,\nfutures have practically no counterparty risk. Forwards, instead, may bear the\nfull risk of default for the counterparty when traded with brokers or outside\nclearing houses, or when embedded in other contracts such as swaps. In this\npaper we focus on energy commodities and on Oil in particular. We use a hybrid\ncommodities-credit model to asses impact of counterparty risk in pricing\nformulas, both in the gross effect of default probabilities and on the subtler\neffects of credit spread volatility, commodities volatility and\ncredit-commodities correlation. We illustrate our general approach with a case\nstudy based on an oil swap, showing that an accurate valuation of counterparty\nrisk depends on volatilities and correlation and cannot be accounted for\nprecisely through a pre-defined multiplier.\n",

The models can be calibrated exactly to credit spreads using\nefficient closed-form formulas for default probabilities. Default events are\ncaused by the value of the firm assets hitting a safety threshold, which\ndepends on the financial situation of the company and on market conditions. In\nAT1P this default barrier is deterministic. Instead SBTV assumes two possible\nscenarios for the initial level of the default barrier, for taking into account\nuncertainty on balance sheet information. While in [19] and [15] the models are\nanalyzed across Parmalat's history, here we apply the models to exact\ncalibration of Lehman Credit Default Swap (CDS) data during the months\npreceding default, as the crisis unfolds. The results we obtain with AT1P and\nSBTV have reasonable economic interpretation, and are particularly realistic\nwhen SBTV is considered. The pricing of counterparty risk in an Equity Return\nSwap is a convenient application we consider, also to illustrate the\ninteraction of our credit models with equity models in hybrid products context.\n",

The market is assumed\nto have access to \"partial\" information about future cash flows. Each cash flow\nis determined by a collection of independent market factors called X-factors.\nThe market filtration is generated by a set of information processes, each of\nwhich carries information about one of the X-factors, and eventually reveals\nthe X-factor. Each information process has two terms, one of which contains a\n\"signal\" about the associated X-factor, and the other of which represents\n\"market noise\". The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the\ndiscounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the\ninformation provided by the market. When the market noise is modelled by a\nBrownian bridge one is able to construct explicit formulae for asset prices, as\nwell as semi-analytic expressions for the prices and greeks of options and\nderivatives. In particular, option price data can be used to determine the\ninformation flow-rate parameters implicit in the definitions of the information\nprocesses. One consequence of the modelling framework is a specific scheme of\nstochastic volatility and correlation processes. Instead of imposing a\nvolatility and correlation model upon the dynamics of a set of assets, one is\nable to deduce the dynamics of the volatilities and correlations of the asset\nprice movements from more primitive assumptions involving the associated cash\nflows. The paper concludes with an examination of situations involving\nasymmetric information. We present a simple model for informed traders and show\nhow this can be used as a basis for so-called statistical arbitrage. Finally,\nwe consider the problem of price formation in a heterogeneous market with\nmultiple agents.\n",

The rapid development of derivative markets has led\nto the possibility of trading various kinds of risks, such as credit and\ninterest rate risk, separately from each other. This paper uses credit default\nswaps and equity options to determine risk premia which are then used to form\nportfolios that are regressed against the returns of stock portfolios. It turns\nout that both, credit risk and implied volatility, have high explanatory power\nin regard to stock returns. Especially the returns of distressed stocks are\nhighly dependent on credit risk fluctuations. This finding leads to practical\nimplications, such as cross-hedging opportunities between equity and credit\ninstruments and potentially allows forecasting stock returns based on movements\nin the credit market.\n",

Systematic mortality risk is due to the uncertain\ndevelopment of future mortality intensities, or {\\it hazard rates}. In this\npaper, we develop a theory for pricing pure endowments when hedging with a\nmortality forward is allowed. The hazard rate associated with the pure\nendowment and the reference hazard rate for the mortality forward are\ncorrelated and are modeled by diffusion processes. We price the pure endowment\nby assuming that the issuing company hedges its contract with the mortality\nforward and requires compensation for the unhedgeable part of the mortality\nrisk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. The major\nresult of this paper is that the value per contract solves a linear partial\ndifferential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can\nrepresent the limiting price as an expectation under an equivalent martingale\nmeasure. Another important result is that hedging with the mortality forward\nmay raise or lower the price of this pure endowment comparing to its price\nwithout hedging, as determined in Bayraktar et al. [2009]. The market price of\nthe reference mortality risk and the correlation between the two portfolios\njointly determine the cost of hedging.

As an important implication, we have also studied the\nsituation where the investor enters an offsetting back-to-back trade with\nanother counter party. We have provided simple numerical examples to\ndemonstrate the change of a fair CDS premium according to the strength of\ndefault dependence among the relevant names, and then discussed its possible\nimplications for the risk management of the central counter parties.\n",

The theory of such models simplifies considerably if one takes a\npricing kernel approach. In one dimension, once the underlying L\\'evy process\nhas been specified, the GLM has four parameters: the initial price, the\ninterest rate, the volatility, and the risk aversion. The pricing kernel is the\nproduct of a discount factor and a risk aversion martingale. For GBM, the risk\naversion parameter is the market price of risk. For a GLM, this interpretation\nis not valid: the excess rate of return is a nonlinear function of the\nvolatility and the risk aversion. It is shown that for positive volatility and\nrisk aversion the excess rate of return above the interest rate is positive,\nand is increasing with respect to these variables. In the case of foreign\nexchange, Siegel's paradox implies that one can construct foreign exchange\nmodels for which the excess rate of return is positive both for the exchange\nrate and the inverse exchange rate. This condition is shown to hold for any\ngeometric L\\'evy model for foreign exchange in which volatility exceeds risk\naversion.\n",

In particular, for given default probability and recovery\nrate, both the level and slope of the yield-to-maturity term structure depend\non the coupon rate, as the higher the coupon rate the higher the\nyield-to-maturity term structure. In addition, the yield-to-maturity term\nstructure is upward or downward sloping depending on whether the coupon rate is\nhigh or low enough.

The\ninsider knows this barrier (as it can be the case for example for the manager\nof the counterparty), whereas standard investors only observe its value at the\ndefault time. All investors aim to maximize the expected utility from terminal\nwealth, on a financial market where the risky asset price is exposed to a\nsudden loss at the default time of the counterparty. In this framework, the\ninsider's information is modelled by using an initial enlargement of filtration\nand \\tau is a stopping time with respect to this enlarged filtration.

In the presence of a\nBrownian component, the second-order term, in time-$t$, is of the form\n$d_{2}\\,t^{(3-Y)/2}$, with $d_{2}$ only depending on $Y$, the degree of jump\nactivity, on $\\sigma$, the volatility of the continuous component, and on an\nadditional parameter controlling the intensity of the \"small\" jumps (regardless\nof their signs). This extends the well known result that the leading\nfirst-order term is $\\sigma t^{1/2}/\\sqrt{2\\pi}$. In contrast, under a\npure-jump model, the dependence on $Y$ and on the separate intensities of\nnegative and positive small jumps are already reflected in the leading term,\nwhich is of the form $d_{1}t^{1/Y}$.

One of the factors is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)\nprocess driven by a Brownian motion and accounts for the small variations. The\nother factor is an OU process driven by a pure jump L\\'evy process and models\nthe characteristic spikes observed in such markets. When it comes to pricing, a\npopular choice of pricing measure is given by the Esscher transform that\npreserves the probabilistic structure of the driving L\\'evy processes, while\nchanging the levels of mean reversion.

As an application, it is shown how this method can be used in\nperforming kurtosis corrections to the standard Black-Scholes-Merton model by a\nmixture of several types of distributions.

When the expansion coefficients factorise into\nmultiple copies of a single function, then the resulting interest rate model is\ncalled coherent, whereas a generic interest rate model will necessarily be\nincoherent. Coherent representations are nevertheless of fundamental importance\nbecause incoherent ones can always be expressed as a linear superposition of\ncoherent elements. This property is exploited to derive general expressions for\nthe pricing kernel and the associated bond price and short rate processes in\nthe case of an n-th order chaos model for each $n$. The pricing formulae for\nbond options and swaptions are obtained in closed forms for a number of\nexamples. An explicit representation for the pricing kernel of a\ngeneric---incoherent---model is then obtained by use of the underlying coherent\nelements. Finally, finite-dimensional realisations of the coherent chaos models\nare investigated in detail. In particular, it is shown that a class of highly\ntractable models can be constructed having the characteristic feature that the\ndiscount bond price is given by a piecewise flat (simple) process.\n",

Anchoring as a heuristic bias causes\ninvestors focusing on recent price changes and price levels, which two lead to\na belief in continuing trend and mean-reversion respectively. The empirical\nresults support our theoretical explanation through an analysis of large price\nfluctuations in the S&P 500 and the resulting effects on implied and realized\nvolatility. These results indicate that asymmetry (a negative relationship)\nbetween shocks and volatility in the subsequent period indeed exists. Moreover,\ncontrary to previous research, our empirical tests also suggest that implied\nvolatility is not simply an upward biased predictor of future deviation\ncompensating for the variance of the volatility but rather, due to investors\nsystematic anchoring to losses and gains in their volatility forecasts, it is a\nco-integrated yet asymmetric over/under estimated financial instrument. We also\nprovide results indicating that the medium-term implied volatility (measured by\nthe VIX Index) is an unbiased though inefficient estimation of realized\nvolatility, while in contrast, the short-term volatility (measured by the\nrecently introduced VXST Index representing the 9-day implied volatility) is\nalso unbiased and yet efficient.\n",

This in turn\nallows us to push the applicability range of known at-the-money skew\napproximation formulae from CLT type log-moneyness deviations of order\n$t^{1/2}$ (recent works of Al\\`{o}s, Le\\'{o}n & Vives and Fukasawa) to the\nwider moderate deviations regime.\n",

We argue\nthat the estimator needs to be priced as a binary option as the arbitrage\nvaluation minimizes the conventionally used Brier score for tracking the\naccuracy of probability assessors.\n  We create a dual martingale process $Y$, in $[L,H]$ from the standard\narithmetic Brownian motion, $X$ in $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ and price elections\naccordingly. The dual process $Y$ can represent the numerical votes needed for\nsuccess.\n  We show the relationship between the volatility of the estimator in relation\nto that of the underlying variable. When there is a high uncertainty about the\nfinal outcome, 1) the arbitrage value of the binary gets closer to 50\\%, 2) the\nestimate should not undergo large changes even if polls or other bases show\nsignificant variations.\n  There are arbitrage relationships between 1) the binary value, 2) the\nestimation of $Y$, 3) the volatility of the estimation of $Y$ over the\nremaining time to expiration. We note that these arbitrage relationships were\noften violated by the various forecasting groups in the U.S. presidential\nelections of 2016, as well as the notion that all intermediate assessments of\nthe success of a candidate need to be considered, not just the final one.\n",

In particular, curtailable block orders and the\nuniform purchase price (UPP) pose serious difficulties. A block is an order\nthat spans over multiple hours, and can be either fully accepted or fully\nrejected. The UPP prescribes that all consumers pay a common price, i.e., the\nUPP, in all the zones, while producers receive zonal prices, which can differ\nfrom one zone to another.\n  The market clearing problem in the presence of both the UPP and block orders\nis a major open issue in the European context. The UPP scheme leads to a\nnon-linear optimization problem involving both primal and dual variables,\nwhereas block orders introduce multi-temporal constraints and binary variables\ninto the problem. As a consequence, the market clearing problem in the presence\nof both blocks and the UPP can be regarded as a non-linear integer programming\nproblem involving both primal and dual variables with complementary and\nmulti-temporal constraints.\n  The aim of this paper is to present a non-iterative and heuristic-free\napproach for solving the market clearing problem in the presence of both\ncurtailable block orders and the UPP. The solution is exact, with no\napproximation up to the level of resolution of current market data. By\nresorting to an equivalent UPP formulation, the proposed approach results in a\nmixed-integer linear program, which is built starting from a non-linear integer\nbilevel programming problem. Numerical results using real market data are\nreported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The model has been\nimplemented in Python, and the code is freely available on a public repository.\n",

In the first contract, a protection\nbuyer pays a premium with a constant intensity $p$ until the drawdown of fixed\nsize occurs.

Next, the\ninsurance contract may expire earlier if a certain fixed drawup event occurs\nprior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of the\nprevious ones but with an additional cancellable feature that allows the\ninvestor to terminate the contracts earlier. In these cases, a fee for early\nstopping depends on the drawdown level at the stopping epoch. In this work, we\nfocus on two problems: calculating the fair premium $p$ for basic contracts and\nfinding the optimal stopping rule for the polices with a cancellable feature.\nTo do this, we use a fluctuation theory of L\\'evy processes and rely on a\ntheory of optimal stopping.\n",

This entails that the\nvolatility process is very rough and its autocorrelation exhibits sharp decay\nat the origin. Another classic stylistic feature often assumed for the\nvolatility is that it is mean reverting. In this paper it is shown that the\nprice impact of a rapidly mean reverting rough volatility model coincides with\nthat associated with fast mean reverting Markov stochastic volatility models.\nThis reconciles the empirical observation of rough volatility paths with the\ngood fit of the implied volatility surface to models of fast mean reverting\nMarkov volatilities. Moreover, the result conforms with recent numerical\nresults regarding rough stochastic volatility models. It extends the scope of\nmodels for which the asymptotic results of fast mean reverting Markov\nvolatilities are valid. The paper concludes with a general discussion of\nfractional volatility asymptotics and their interrelation. The regimes\ndiscussed there include fast and slow volatility factors with strong or small\nvolatility fluctuations and with the limits not commuting in general.

This contract expires early if a certain fixed drawup event\noccurs prior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of\nthe previous ones by an additional cancellation feature which allows the\ninvestor to terminate the contract earlier. We focus on two problems:\ncalculating the fair premium $p$ for the basic contracts and identifying the\noptimal stopping rule for the policies with the cancellation feature.

A basic example is the Black--Scholes call price\nsurface, from which an interesting inequality for Black--Scholes implied\nvolatility is derived. The binary operation is compatible with the convex\norder, and therefore a one-parameter sub-semigroup gives rise to an\narbitrage-free market model. It is shown that each such one-parameter semigroup\ncorresponds to a unique log-concave probability density, providing a family of\ntractable call price surface parametrisations in the spirit of the\nGatheral--Jacquier SVI surface. An explicit example is given to illustrate the\nidea. The key observation is an isomorphism linking an initial call price curve\nto the lift zonoid of the terminal price of the underlying asset.\n",

We consider two pricing approaches, the\nclassical risk-neutral approach and the benchmark approach, and we examine the\nassociated static and optimal behaviors of both the investor and insurer. The\nfirst model considered is the so-called minimal market model, where pricing is\nachieved using the benchmark approach. The benchmark approach was introduced by\nPlaten in 2001 and has received wide acceptance in the finance community. Under\nthis approach, valuing an asset involves determining the minimum-valued\nreplicating portfolio, with reference to the growth optimal portfolio under the\nreal-world probability measure, and it both subsumes classical risk-neutral\npricing as a particular case and extends it to situations where risk-neutral\npricing is impossible. The second model is the Black-Scholes model for the\nequity index, where the pricing of contracts is performed within the\nrisk-neutral framework. Crucially, we demonstrate that when the insurer prices\nand reserves using the Black-Scholes model, while the insured employs a dynamic\nwithdrawal strategy based on the minimal market model, the insurer may be\nunderestimating the value and associated reserves of the contract.\n",

Most importantly,\nour model predicts the negative effect of an increase in squared return\nvolatility on the value of deep-in-the-money call options and, furthermore,\nattempts to explain the volatility puzzle. We theoretically demonstrate a\nmechanism by which the market price of diffusion return risk, or an equity\nrisk-premium, affects option prices and empirically illustrate how to identify\nthat mechanism using forward-looking information on option contracts. Our\ntheoretical and empirical results support the relevance of the volatility\nfeedback effect. Overall, the results indicate that the prevailing practice of\nignoring the time-varying dividend yield in option pricing can lead to\noversimplification of the stock market dynamics.\n",

Hence any $n$-dimensional time series\nmodel also has to satisfy these implicit restrictions at each time step, a\ncondition that is impossible to meet since the model innovations can take\narbitrary values. We solve this problem for any $n\\in\\NN$ in the context of\nForeign Exchange (FX) by first encoding the option prices at each time step in\nterms of the parameters of the corresponding risk-neutral measure and then\nperforming the time series analysis in the parameter space. The option price\npredictions are obtained from the predicted risk-neutral measure by effectively\nintegrating it against the corresponding option payoffs.

Our results show that entropy decreases in the\nfunction of the number of securities involved in a portfolio in a similar way\nto the standard deviation, and that efficient portfolios are situated on a\nhyperbola in the expected return - entropy system. For empirical investigation\nwe use daily returns of 150 randomly selected securities for a period of 27\nyears. Our regression results show that entropy has a higher explanatory power\nfor the expected return than the capital asset pricing model beta. Furthermore\nwe show the time varying behaviour of the beta along with entropy.\n",

However, low\nsignal-to-noise ratio and instability that are inherent in equity markets pose\nchallenges to determine the state transition (stock price change) after\nexecuting an action (the principal investor's decision) as well as decide an\naction based on current state (spot price). In order to conquer these\nchallenges, we resort to a Bayesian deep neural network for computing the\npredictive distribution of the state transition led by an action. Additionally,\ninstead of exploring a state-action relationship to formulate a policy, we seek\nfor an episode based visible-hidden state-action relationship to\nprobabilistically imitate the principal investor's successive decision making.\nUnlike conventional option pricing that employs analytical stochastic processes\nor utilizes time series analysis to model and sample underlying stock price\nmovements, our algorithm simulates stock price paths by imitating the principal\ninvestor's behavior which requires no preset probability distribution and fewer\npredetermined parameters. Eventually the optimal option price is learned by\nreinforcement learning to maximize the cumulative risk-adjusted return of a\ndynamically hedged portfolio over simulated price paths.\n",

A real\nlinear combination of the original and added processes leads to a commutation\nrelation analogous to that between a boson field and its canonical momentum in\nquantum field theory.

One\nchallenge in pricing these securities is their infrequent trading, which leads\nto insufficient data for individual pricing. However, many of these securities\nshare structural features that can be utilized. Building on this, we propose a\nmulti-task dynamic pricing framework that leverages these shared structures\nacross securities, enhancing pricing accuracy through learning.\n  In our framework, a security is fully characterized by a $d$ dimensional\ncontextual/feature vector. The customer will buy (sell) the security from the\nbroker if the broker quotes a price lower (higher) than that of the\ncompetitors. We assume a linear contextual model for the competitor's pricing,\nwith unknown parameters a priori. The parameters for pricing different\nsecurities may or may not be similar to each other. The firm's objective is to\nminimize the expected regret, namely, the expected revenue loss against a\nclairvoyant policy which has the knowledge of the parameters of the\ncompetitor's pricing model. We show that the regret of our policy is better\nthan both the policy that treats each security individually and the policy that\ntreats all securities as the same. Moreover, the regret is bounded by\n$\\tilde{O} ( \\delta_{\\max} \\sqrt{T M d} + M d ) $, where $M$ is the number of\nsecurities and $\\delta_{\\max}$ characterizes the overall dissimilarity across\nsecurities in the basket.\n",

Second, the high frequency\ntrading activities are allowed and described by the scaling limit of\nnearly-unstable multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with power law decay. The\nmodel has been derived as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE, for\nshort), under certain intuitive identifications. Its diffusion coefficient is\ndetermined by a Volterra integral equation driven by a Hawkes process, whose\nHurst exponent is less than 1/2 (so that the relevant process is negatively\ncorrelated). As a result, the volatility path of the SPDE is rougher than that\ndriven by a (standard) Brownian motion. The well-posedness follows from a\nresult in literature. Hence, a foundation is laid down for further studies in\nthis direction.\n",

In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.\nEach cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a\nfunction of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.\nWith each such \"X-factor\" we associate a market information process, the values\nof which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of\ntwo terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;\nthe other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent\nBrownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the\naggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is\ngiven by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral\nmeasure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When\nthe cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit\nmodel is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on\ndividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the\nprice of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The\ninformation-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin\nof stochastic volatility.\n",

This strategy stems from the Black--Merton--Scholes\nmodel where it perfectly replicates contingent claims. From the theoretical\nviewpoint, there is no reason for this to hold in models with jumps. However in\npractice the delta-hedging strategy is widely used and its potential\nshortcoming in models with jumps is disregarded since such models are typically\nincomplete and hence most contingent claims are non-attainable. In this note we\ninvestigate a complete model with jumps where the delta-hedging strategy is\nwell-defined for regular payoff functions and is uniquely determined via the\nrisk-neutral measure. In this setting we give examples of (admissible)\ndelta-hedging strategies with bounded discounted value processes, which\nnevertheless fail to replicate the respective bounded contingent claims. This\ndemonstrates that the deficiency of the delta-hedging strategy in the presence\nof jumps is not due to the incompleteness of the model but is inherent in the\ndiscontinuity of the trajectories.\n",

The dual problem is to find the\ncheapest semi-static subhedge.\n  Under an assumption on the supports of the marginal laws, but no assumption\nthat the laws are atom-free or in any other way regular, we derive explicit\nexpressions for the coupling which minimises the price of the option, and the\nform of the semi-static subhedge.\n",

For European options with payoff functions satisfying a\ncombinatorial property called submodularity or supermodularity, this\noptimization is solved in closed form by using the Lov\\'asz extension and the\nupper and lower hedging prices can be calculated efficiently. This class\nincludes the options on the maximum or the minimum of several assets. We also\nstudy the asymptotic behavior as the number of game rounds goes to infinity.\nThe upper and lower hedging prices of European options converge to the\nsolutions of the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equations. For European options with\nsubmodular or supermodular payoff functions, the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt\nequation is reduced to the linear Black-Scholes equation and it is solved in\nclosed form.

As such various pricing approaches have been proposed, but\nnone treat the uncertainty in catastrophe occurrences and interest rates in a\nsufficiently flexible and statistically reliable way within a unifying asset\npricing framework. Consequently, little is known empirically about the expected\nrisk-premia of CAT bonds. The primary contribution of this paper is to present\na unified Bayesian CAT bond pricing framework based on uncertainty\nquantification of catastrophes and interest rates. Our framework allows for\ncomplex beliefs about catastrophe risks to capture the distinct and common\npatterns in catastrophe occurrences, and when combined with stochastic interest\nrates, yields a unified asset pricing approach with informative expected risk\npremia. Specifically, using a modified collective risk model -- Dirichlet\nPrior-Hierarchical Bayesian Collective Risk Model (DP-HBCRM) framework -- we\nmodel catastrophe risk via a model-based clustering approach. Interest rate\nrisk is modeled as a CIR process under the Bayesian approach. As a consequence\nof casting CAT pricing models into our framework, we evaluate the price and\nexpected risk premia of various CAT bond contracts corresponding to clustering\nof catastrophe risk profiles.

Operating on\nPCWs requires insurers to strike a delicate balance between competitive\npremiums and profitability, amidst obstacles such as low historical conversion\nrates, limited visibility of competitors' actions, and a dynamic market\nenvironment. In addition to this, the capital intensive nature of the business\nmeans pricing below the risk levels of customers can result in solvency issues\nfor the insurer. To address these challenges, this paper introduces\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that learns the optimal pricing policy by\nintegrating model-based and model-free methods. The model-based component is\nused to train agents in an offline setting, avoiding cold-start issues, while\nmodel-free algorithms are then employed in a contextual bandit (CB) manner to\ndynamically update the pricing policy to maximise the expected revenue. This\nfacilitates quick adaptation to evolving market dynamics and enhances algorithm\nefficiency and decision interpretability. The paper also highlights the\nimportance of evaluating pricing policies using an offline dataset in a\nconsistent fashion and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed methodology\nover existing off-the-shelf RL/CB approaches. We validate our methodology using\nsynthetic data, generated to reflect private commercially available data within\nreal-world insurers, and compare against 6 other benchmark approaches. Our\nhybrid agent outperforms these benchmarks in terms of sample efficiency and\ncumulative reward with the exception of an agent that has access to perfect\nmarket information which would not be available in a real-world set-up.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper, we investigate a complex variation of the standard joint life\nannuity policy by introducing three distinct contingent benefits for the\nsurviving member(s) of a couple, along with a contingent benefit for their\nbeneficiaries if both members pass away. Our objective is to price this\ninnovative insurance policy and analyse its sensitivity to key model\nparameters, particularly those related to the joint mortality framework. We\nemploy the $QP$-rule (described in Section \\ref{secgenset}), which combines the\nreal-world probability measure $P$ for mortality risk with risk-neutral\nvaluation under $Q$ for financial market risks. The model enables explicit\npricing expressions, computed using efficient numerical methods. Our results\nhighlight the interdependent risks faced by couples, such as broken-heart\nsyndrome, providing valuable insights for insurers and policyholders regarding\nthe pricing influences of these factors.\n",

        "summary": "  We fit the volatility fluctuations of the S&P 500 index well by a Chi\ndistribution, and the distribution of log-returns by a corresponding\nsuperposition of Gaussian distributions. The Fourier transform of this is,\nremarkably, of the Tsallis type. An option pricing formula is derived from the\nsame superposition of Black-Scholes expressions. An explicit analytic formula\nis deduced from a perturbation expansion around a Black-Scholes formula with\nthe mean volatility. The expansion has two parts. The first takes into account\nthe non-Gaussian character of the stock-fluctuations and is organized by powers\nof the excess kurtosis, the second is contract based, and is organized by the\nmoments of moneyness of the option. With this expansion we show that for the\nDow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 option data, a Delta-hedging strategy is close to being\noptimal.\n",
