This simple, unique, and robust model is the smallest possible\ndeterministic model of financial complexity, and its generalization leads to\ncomplex variety. Compared to a random walk, the minimal model generates time\nseries with fatter tails and more frequent crashes, thus more closely matching\nthe real world.

Robust nature of Pareto's law across economies, ideologies and\nnations suggests that this could be an outcome of trading strategies. However,\nthe simple asset exchange models fail to reproduce this feature. A yardsale(YS)\nmodel in which amount put on the bet is a fraction of minimum of the two\nplayers leads to condensation of wealth in hands of some agent while theft and\nfraud(TF) model in which the amount to be exchanged is a fraction of loser's\nwealth leads to an exponential distribution of wealth. We show that if we allow\nfew agents to follow a different model than others, {\\it i.e.} there are some\nagents following TF model while rest follow YS model, it leads to distribution\nwith power law tails. Similar effect is observed when one carries out\ntransactions for a fraction of one's wealth using TF model and for the rest YS\nmodel is used. We also observe a power law tail in wealth distribution if we\nallow the agents to follow either of the models with some probability.\n",

Several models have been employed to explain this behavior.\nHowever, most of the agent based models assume the conservation of number of\nagents and wealth. Both these assumptions are unrealistic. In this paper, we\nstudy the limiting wealth distribution when one or both of these assumptions\nare not valid. Given the universality of the law, we have tried to study the\nwealth distribution from the asset exchange models point of view. We consider\nmodels in which a) new agents enter the market at constant rate b) richer\nagents fragment with higher probability introducing newer agents in the system\nc) both fragmentation and entry of new agents is taking place. While models a)\nand c) do not conserve total wealth or number of agents, model b) conserves\ntotal wealth. All these models lead to a power-law tail in the wealth\ndistribution pointing to the possibility that more generalized asset exchange\nmodels could help us to explain emergence of power-law tail in wealth\ndistribution.\n",

Hanson introduced a market maker derived from\nthe logarithmic scoring rule, and later Chen and Pennock developed a cost\nfunction formulation for the market maker. On the other hand, the SCPM model of\nPeters et al. is based on ideas from a call auction setting using a convex\noptimization model. In this work, we develop a unified framework that bridges\nthese seemingly unrelated models for centrally organizing contingent claim\nmarkets. The framework, developed as a generalization of the SCPM, will support\nmany desirable properties such as proper scoring, truthful bidding (in a myopic\nsense), efficient computation, and guarantees on worst case loss. In fact, our\nunified framework will allow us to express various proper scoring rules,\nexisting or new, from classical utility functions in a convex optimization\nproblem representing the market organizer. Additionally, we utilize concepts\nfrom duality to show that the market model is equivalent to a risk minimization\nproblem where a convex risk measure is employed. This will allow us to more\nclearly understand the differences in the risk attitudes adopted by various\nmechanisms, and particularly deepen our intuition about popular mechanisms like\nHanson's market-maker. In aggregate, we believe this work advances our\nunderstanding of the objectives that the market organizer is optimizing in\npopular pari-mutuel mechanisms by recasting them into one unified framework.\n",

A trading\nsession on a fixed graph consists of a sequence of exchanges between connected\nbuyers and sellers until no more exchanges are possible. We deem a trading\nsession \"feasible\" if all of the buyers satisfy their respective demands. If\nall trading sessions are feasible the graph is deemed \"successful\", otherwise\nthe feasibility of a trading session depends on the order of the sequence of\nexchanges. We demonstrate that topology is important for the success of trading\nsessions on graphs. In particular, for the case that supply equals demand for\neach component of the graph, we prove that the graph is successful if and only\nif the graph consists of components each of which are complete bipartite. For\nthe case that supply exceeds demand, we prove that the other topologies also\ncan be made successful but with finite reserve (i.e., excess supply)\nrequirements that may grow proportional to the number of buyers. Finally, with\ncomputations for a small instance of the model, we provide an example of the\nwide range of performance in which only the connectivity varies.

Quantitative differences are\nobserved between the institutional and individual investors.

The price impact of the transactions inside trade packages displays a\nU-shaped profile with respect to the time $t$ of the day, and also shows a\npower-law dependence on their trading volumes. The trading volumes of the\ntransactions inside trade packages made by institutions have a stronger impact\non current returns, but the following price reversals persist over a relatively\nshorter horizon in comparison with those by individuals.\n",

Initially, firms can invest both in low-emitting production\ntechnologies and trade permits. In the model, technology adoption and allowance\nprice are generated endogenously and are inter-dependent. It is shown that the\nnon-cooperative permit trading game possesses a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium,\nwhere the allowance value reflects the level of uncovered pollution (demand),\nthe level of unused allowances (supply), and the technological status. These\nconditions are also satisfied when a price support instrument, which is\ncontingent on the adoption of the new technology, is introduced. Numerical\ninvestigation confirms that this policy generates a floating price floor for\nthe allowances, and it restores the dynamic incentives to invest. Given that\nthis policy comes at a cost, a criterion for the selection of a self-financing\npolicy (based on convex risk measures) is proposed and implemented.\n",

In this paper, we consider a stochastic control problem\nsimilar to the one introduced by Ho and Stoll and formalized mathematically by\nAvellaneda and Stoikov. The market is modeled using a reference price $S_t$\nfollowing a Brownian motion with standard deviation $\\sigma$, arrival rates of\nbuy or sell liquidity-consuming orders depend on the distance to the reference\nprice $S_t$ and a market maker maximizes the expected utility of its P&L over a\nfinite time horizon.

The purpose is to understand the interactions of the\ndifferent aspects within a 'semi-closed' system. The complexity and nature of\nthe system led to the process of modifying the pricing mechanism which is\nviewed from a different angle to the classical Brownian Motion and the Random\nWalk model. However, it incorporates the essence of these two fundamental\ntheories and then investigates the matrix of investors' behaviours in relation\nto news feedbacks. This paper also explores the realm of randomly generated\nnews to the responses of participants to determine rational and irrational\nbehaviours. This is carried out through uncompressing the time within the\nexperiment and looking at concordant and disconcordant behaviour. The focus is\non how the modified pricing equation adapts to the conditions and uniqueness\nsurrounding a semi-closed stock market. Thus, this paper looks at how a simple\nmarket system where the main determinants of share prices are news, demand and\nsupply along with some filtering of the external forces can affect the\nbehaviours of investors in terms of their portfolio composition. The return\ndistributions can then be stipulated as arising from rational or irrational\ntrajectories and subsequently be simulated and matched via the proposed\nmodified Brownian Motion model to empirical return distributions in specific\ntime periods and markets.\n",

Moreover, we define price jump as a sell\n(buy) market order arrival which is executed at a price which is smaller\n(larger) than the best bid (best ask) price at the moment just after the\nprecedent market order arrival. Features are then extracted related to limit\norder volumes, limit order price gaps, market order information and limit order\nevent information. Logistic regression is applied to predict the price jump\nfrom the limit order book's feature. LASSO logistic regression is introduced to\nhelp us make variable selection from which we are capable to highlight the\nimportance of different features in predicting the future price jump.

The displacement\nof the middle of the buffer from the costfree position is found to be\nproportional to the square of the width, and hence to the 2/3 power of the\ntransaction cost; the proportionality constant depends on the expected\nshort-term change in position.\n",

The high-frequency trader has the choice to trade via market\norders or limit orders, which are represented respectively by impulse controls\nand regular controls. We model and discuss the consequences of the two main\nfeatures of this particular microstructure: first, the limit orders sent by the\nhigh frequency trader are only partially executed, and therefore she has no\ncontrol on the executed quantity. For this purpose, cumulative executed volumes\nare modelled by compound Poisson processes. Second, the high frequency trader\nfaces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of brutal variations in her\ninventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of\noptimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic\ncontrol and dynamic programming methods, which lead to a characterization of\nthe value function in terms of an integro quasi-variational inequality. We then\nprovide the associated numerical resolution procedure, and convergence of this\ncomputational scheme is proved. Next, we examine several situations where we\ncan on one hand simplify the numerical procedure by reducing the number of\nstate variables, and on the other hand focus on specific cases of practical\ninterest. We examine both a market making problem and a best execution problem\nin the case where the mid-price process is a martingale. We also detail a high\nfrequency trading strategy in the case where a (predictive) directional\ninformation on the mid-price is available. Each of the resulting strategies are\nillustrated by numerical tests.\n",

We show that there is an equivalence between selfsimilar\nmodels and a family of risk measures called p-variations: assuming a\nself-similar process and calibrating empirically the parameter p for the\np-variation yields the same result as assuming a Brownian motion and using the\np-variation as risk measure instead of the variance. We also show that p can be\nseen as a measure of the aggressiveness: p increases if and only if the TC\nalgorithm starts later and executes faster.

To this end, we\nfocus on a class of dark-pool models whose market impact at the exchange is\ndescribed by an Almgren--Chriss model. Conditions for the absence of price\nmanipulation for all Almgren--Chriss models include the absence of temporary\ncross-venue impact, the presence of full permanent cross-venue impact, and the\nadditional penalization of orders executed in the dark pool. When a particular\nAlmgren--Chriss model has been fixed, we show by a number of examples that the\nregularity of the dark-pool model hinges in a subtle way on the interplay of\nall model parameters and on the liquidation time constraint.

        "summary": "  We propose a formula of time-series prediction by means of three states\nrandom field Ising model (RFIM). At the economic crisis due to disasters or\ninternational disputes, the stock price suddenly drops. The macroscopic\nphenomena should be explained from the corresponding microscopic view point\nbecause there are existing a huge number of active traders behind the crushes.\nHence, here we attempt to model the artificial financial market in which each\ntrader $i$ can choose his/her decision among `buying', `selling' or `staying\n(taking a wait-and-see attitude)', each of which corresponds to a realization\nof the three state Ising spin, namely, $S_{i}=+1$, -1 and $S_{i}=0$,\nrespectively. The decision making of traders is given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann\ndistribution with the energy function. The energy function contains three\ndistinct terms, namely, the ferromagnetic two-body interaction term (endogenous\ninformation), random field term as external information (exogenous news), and\nchemical potential term which controls the number of traders who are watching\nthe market calmly at the instance. We specify the details of the model system\nfrom the past financial market data to determine the conjugate hyper-parameters\nand draw each parameter flow as a function of time-step. Especially we will\nexamine to what extent one can characterize the crisis by means of a brand-new\norder parameter --- `turnover' --- which is defined as the number of active\ntraders who post their decisions $S_{i}=1,-1$, instead of $S_{i}=0$.\n",

Volume measures are the continuum analogies for discrete volume\nprofiles commonly implemented in the execution industry. Execution then becomes\nan absolutely continuous measure over such a measure space, and its\nRadon-Nikodym derivative is commonly known as the Participation of Volume (PoV)\nfunction. The four impact cost components are all consistently built upon the\nPoV function. Some novel efforts are made for these linear impact models by\nhaving market signals more properly expressed. For the opportunistic cost, we\nare able to go beyond the conventional Brownian-type motions. By working\ndirectly with the auto-covariances of the price dynamics, we remove the\nMarkovian restriction associated with Brownians and thus allow potential memory\neffects in the price dynamics. In combination, the final execution model\nbecomes a constrained quadratic programming problem in infinite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. Important linear constraints such as participation capping are\nall permissible. Uniqueness and existence of optimal solutions are established\nvia the theory of positive compact operators in Hilbert spaces. Several typical\nnumerical examples explain both the behavior and versatility of the model.\n",

We describe the\nbehavior when some uninformed agents, who we call switchers, decide whether or\nnot to pay for information before they trade. By paying for the information\nthey behave as informed traders. First we verify that our model is able to\nreproduce some of the stylized facts in real financial markets. Next we\nconsider the relationship between switching and the market volatility under\ndifferent structures of investors. We find that there exists a positive\nrelationship between the market volatility and the percentage of switchers. We\ntherefore conclude that the switchers are a destabilizing factor in the market.\nHowever, for a given fixed percentage of switchers, the proportion of switchers\nthat decide to buy information at a given moment of time is negatively related\nto the current market volatility. In other words, if more agents pay for\ninformation to know the fundamental value at some time, the market volatility\nwill be lower. This is because the market price is closer to the fundamental\nvalue due to information diffusion between switchers.\n",

This condition\nindicates that unique equilibria are played if player's public disagreement is\nsubstantial. If disagreement is small, equilibrium multiplicity depends on the\nrelative precisions of private signals and subjective priors. Extensions to\nenvironments with public signals of exogenous and endogenous quality show that\nprior heterogeneity, unlike heterogeneity in private information, provides a\nrobust anchor for unique equilibria.

Despite of the fact\nthat prospect theory has been well developed in behavioral economics at the\ntheoretical level, there exist very few large-scale empirical studies and most\nof them have been undertaken with micro-panel data. Here we analyze over 28.5\nmillion trades made by 81.3 thousand traders of an online financial trading\ncommunity over 28 months, aiming to explore the large-scale empirical aspect of\nprospect theory. By analyzing and comparing the behavior of winning and losing\ntrades and traders, we find clear evidence of the loss aversion phenomenon, an\nessence in prospect theory. This work hence demonstrates an unprecedented\nlarge-scale empirical evidence of prospect theory, which has immediate\nimplication in financial trading, e.g., developing new trading strategies by\nminimizing the effect of loss aversion. Moreover, we introduce three\nrisk-adjusted metrics inspired by prospect theory to differentiate winning and\nlosing traders based on their historical trading behavior.

Our framework allows one to compute the average price\ntrajectory in the presence of a meta-order, that consistently generalizes\npreviously proposed propagator models. We account for the universally observed\nsquare-root impact law, and predict non-trivial trajectories when trading is\ninterrupted or reversed. We prove that our framework is free of price\nmanipulation, and that prices can be made diffusive (albeit with a generic\nshort-term mean-reverting contribution). Our model suggests that prices can be\ndecomposed into a transient \"mechanical\" impact component and a permanent\n\"informational\" component.\n",

Including this factor in the fits reinforces the square\nroot shape of impact. We observe a power-law for the transient impact with an\nexponent between $0.5$ (for long metaorders) and $0.8$ (for shorter ones).\nMoreover we show that the market does not anticipate the size of the\nmeta-orders. The intraday decay seems to exhibit two regimes (though hard to\nidentify precisely): a \"slow\" regime right after the execution of the\nmeta-order followed by a faster one. At the daily time scale, we show price\nmoves after a metaorder can be split between realizations of expected returns\nthat have triggered the investing decision and an idiosynchratic impact that\nslowly decays to zero.\n  Moreover we propose a class of toy models based on Hawkes processes (the\nHawkes Impact Models, HIM) to illustrate our reasoning.\n  We show how the Impulsive-HIM model, despite its simplicity, embeds appealing\nfeatures like transience and decay of impact. The latter is parametrized by a\nparameter $C$ having a macroscopic interpretation: the ratio of contrarian\nreaction (i.e. impact decay) and of the \"herding\" reaction (i.e. impact\namplification).\n",

Although the models that explain the\nvarious states of financial markets offer substantial evidences from the fields\nof finance, mathematics, and even physics to explain states observed in the\nreal financial markets, previous theories that attempt to fully explain the\ncomplexities of financial markets have been inadequate. In this study, we\npropose an artificial double auction market as an agent-based model approach to\nstudy the origin of complex states in the financial markets, characterizing\nimportant parameters with an investment strategy that can cover the dynamics of\nthe financial market. The investment strategy of chartist traders after market\ninformation arrives should reduce market stability originating in the price\nfluctuations of risky assets. However, fundamentalist traders strategically\nsubmit orders with a fundamental value and, thereby stabilize the market. We\nconstruct a continuous double auction market and find that the market is\ncontrolled by a fraction of chartists, P_{c}. We show that mimicking real\nfinancial markets state, which emerges in real financial systems, is given\nbetween approximately P_{c} = 0.40 and P_{c} = 0.85, but that mimicking the\nefficient market hypothesis state can be generated in a range of less than\nP_{c} = 0.40. In particular, we observe that the mimicking market collapse\nstate created in a value greater than P_{c} = 0.85, in which a liquidity\nshortage occurs, and the phase transition behavior is P_{c} = 0.85.\n",

On smaller time scales (30 seconds), instead,\nthe static depletion of the limit order book is an indicator of an intrinsic\nfragility of the system, which is related to a strongly non linear enhancement\nof the response.

The improved model builds on the\ntime-averaged number of particles in the inner layer and its change per unit\ntime, where the inner layer is revealed by the correlations between price\nvelocity and change in the number of particles (limit orders).

Although the resiliency patterns show obvious diversity after\ndifferent types of market orders, the spread and depth can return to the sample\naverage within 20 best limit updates. The price resiliency behavior is dominant\nafter aggressive market orders, while the price continuation behavior is\ndominant after less-aggressive market orders. Moreover, the effective market\norders produce asymmetrical stimulus to limit orders when the initial spreads\nequal to 1 tick. Under this case, effective buy market orders attract more buy\nlimit orders and effective sell market orders attract more sell limit orders.\nThe resiliency behavior of spread and depth is linked to limit order intensity.\n",

        "summary": "  Market impact is a key concept in the study of financial markets and several\nmodels have been proposed in the literature so far. The Transient Impact Model\n(TIM) posits that the price at high frequency time scales is a linear\ncombination of the signs of the past executed market orders, weighted by a\nso-called propagator function. An alternative description -- the History\nDependent Impact Model (HDIM) -- assumes that the deviation between the\nrealised order sign and its expected level impacts the price linearly and\npermanently. The two models, however, should be extended since prices are a\npriori influenced not only by the past order flow, but also by the past\nrealisation of returns themselves. In this paper, we propose a two-event\nframework, where price-changing and non price-changing events are considered\nseparately. Two-event propagator models provide a remarkable improvement of the\ndescription of the market impact, especially for large tick stocks, where the\nevents of price changes are very rare and very informative. Specifically the\nextended approach captures the excess anti-correlation between past returns and\nsubsequent order flow which is missing in one-event models. Our results\ndocument the superior performances of the HDIMs even though only in minor\nrelative terms compared to TIMs. This is somewhat surprising, because HDIMs are\nwell grounded theoretically, while TIMs are, strictly speaking, inconsistent.\n",

Part I of this\npaper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price\ndynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns\non the future order flow. However, impact models presented in Part I consider\nthe order flow as an exogenous process, only characterized by its two-point\ncorrelations. This assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the\nmodel. Here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a\nso-called Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) framework, introduced\noriginally by Raftery (1985). We distinguish between price-changing and non\nprice-changing events and combine them with the order sign in order to reduce\nthe order flow dynamics to the dynamics of a four-state discrete random\nvariable. The MTD represents a parsimonious approximation of a full high-order\nMarkov chain. The new approach captures with adequate realism the conditional\ncorrelation functions between signed events for both small and large tick\nstocks and signature plots. From a methodological viewpoint, we discuss a novel\nand flexible way to calibrate a large class of MTD models with a very large\nnumber of parameters. In spite of this large number of parameters, an\nout-of-sample analysis confirms that the model does not overfit the data.\n",

Our main result is that when time is far from the terminal, the\noptimal price for bid and ask limit orders is constant, which means that it\ndoes not track the underlying price. Numerical simulations confirm this\nbehavior. When the underlying price is mean reverting, then for times\nsufficiently far from terminal, it is more advantageous to focus on the mean\nprice and ignore fluctuations around it. Mean reversion suggests that limit\norders will be executed with some regularity, and this is why they are optimal.\nWe also explore intermediate time regimes where limit order prices are\ninfluenced by the inventory of outstanding orders. The duration of this\nintermediate regime depends on the liquidity of the market as measured by\nspecific parameters in the model.\n",

We emphasis the exposure to\nadverse selection, of paramount importance for limit orders. For a participant\nbuying using a limit order: if the price has chances to go down the probability\nto be filled is high but it is better to wait a little more before the trade to\nobtain a better price.

There is thus a rational\nfor market makers to be as fast as possible as a protection to adverse\nselection.

And if you wish to make a profit you must process at least twice as\nmuch data.\" - Red Queen to Alice in Hedge-Fund-Land.\n  In this age of (Too Much) Information, it is imperative to uncover nuggets of\nknowledge (signal) from buckets of nonsense (noise). To aid in this effort to\nextract meaning from chaos and to gain a better understanding of the\nrelationships between financial variables, we summarize the application of the\ntheoretical results from (Kashyap 2016b) to microstructure studies. The central\nconcept rests on a novel methodology based on the marriage between the\nBhattacharyya distance, a measure of similarity across distributions, and the\nJohnson Lindenstrauss Lemma, a technique for dimension reduction, providing us\nwith a simple yet powerful tool that allows comparisons between data-sets\nrepresenting any two distributions. We provide an empirical illustration using\nprices, volumes and volatilities across seven countries and three different\ncontinents. The degree to which different markets or sub groups of securities\nhave different measures of their corresponding distributions tells us the\nextent to which they are different. This can aid investors looking for\ndiversification or looking for more of the same thing.\n",

The paper discusses trading strategies for both\ncommodities and stocks but the main focus is on stock market trading at the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\n  Problem 1: Buy Low and Sell High. The buy low and sell high problem can be\nsummarized like this: suppose the price of a commodity or stock fluctuates\nindefinitely, is there any explicit strategy for a trader to \"ride the price\nwaves\" by buying low and selling high to eventually win even if price does not\nincrease?\n  Problem 2: \"Beat\" the Market. In Part 2, the trading system presented in Part\n1 is transformed into a strategy that always outperforms the market eventually.\n  Problem 3: Can a Trader Outperform a geometric Brownian Motion? The general\nbelief is that it is impossible to \"beat\" a GBM since technical analysis of\nhistorical prices is useless in predicting future prices. The last part of the\npaper shows that the answer to Problem 3 is actually a \"YES\", which is quite\nsurprising.\n  The trading strategies presented are based mainly on information obtained\nfrom the movements of waves and wavelets created by large and small\nfluctuations of market prices. They do not involve any forecasting or\nprediction of future prices. Behavioral economics also plays a role in the\ndecision making process of the Wavelet Trading program.

Recently, universal and\nhighly nonlinear master curves were observed for price impacts aggregated on\nall intra-day scales [1]. Here we investigate how well these curves, their\nscaling, and the underlying return dynamics are captured by linear \"propagator\"\nmodels. We find that the classification of trades as price-changing versus\nnon-price-changing can explain the price impact nonlinearities and short-term\nreturn dynamics to a very high degree. The explanatory power provided by the\nchange indicator in addition to the order sign history increases with\nincreasing tick size. To obtain these results, several long-standing technical\nissues for model calibration and -testing are addressed. We present new\nspectral estimators for two- and three-point cross-correlations, removing the\nneed for previously used approximations. We also show when calibration is\nunbiased and how to accurately reveal previously overlooked biases. Therefore,\nour results contribute significantly to understanding both recent empirical\nresults and the properties of a popular class of impact models.\n",

The\naggregation procedure can be used to integrate security-wise and time-wise\ninformation about investor trading networks, but it is not limited to finance.\nIn fact, it can be used for different applications, such as gene,\ntransportation, and social networks, were they inferred or observable.\nAdditionally, in the investor network inference, we use transaction\nbootstrapping for better statistical validation. Investor categorization allows\nfor constant size networks and having more observations for each node, which is\nimportant in the inference especially for less liquid securities. Furthermore,\nwe observe that the window size used for averaging has a substantial effect on\nthe number of inferred relationships. We apply this procedure by analyzing a\nunique data set of Finnish shareholders during the period 2004-2009. We find\nthat households in the capital have high centrality in investor networks,\nwhich, under the theory of information channels in investor networks suggests\nthat they are well-informed investors.\n",

We\ndescribe the exact nature of the `superior information' high frequency traders\nhave access to, and how these agents differ from the more standard `insider\ntraders' described in past papers. This then leads to a model and an empirical\nanalysis of the data which strongly supports our claims. The second key element\nis a rigorous description of clearing conditions on a limit order book and how\nto derive correct formulas for such a market. From a theoretical point of view,\nthis allows the exact identification of two frictions in the market, one of\nwhich is intimately linked to our notion of `superior information'.\nEmpirically, we show that ignoring these frictions can misrepresent the wealth\nexchanged on the market by 50%.

The European corporate bond market is an archetypal example of such\nan illiquid market where mid-prices can only be estimated with a statistical\nmodel. In this OTC market, dealers / market makers only have access, indeed, to\npartial information about the market. In real time, they know the price\nassociated with their trades on the dealer-to-dealer (D2D) and dealer-to-client\n(D2C) markets, they know the result of the requests for quotes (RFQ) they\nanswered, and they have access to composite prices (e.g., Bloomberg CBBT). This\npaper presents a Bayesian method for estimating the mid-price of corporate\nbonds by using the real-time information available to a dealer. This method\nrelies on recent ideas coming from the particle filtering / sequential\nMonte-Carlo literature.\n",

We see that once the amount of spread changes due to\ndeletions exceeds the amount of the ones due to trades, other observables in\nthe order book change as well. We then look at how these spread changing events\naffect the prices of stocks, by means of the price response. We not only see\nthat the self-response of stocks is positive for both spread changing trades\nand deletions and negative for order placements, but also cross-response to\nother stocks and therefore the market as a whole. In addition, the\nself-response function of spread-changing trades is similar to that of all\ntrades.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) attributed the\n$2010$ flash crash, one of the most turbulent periods in the history of\nfinancial markets that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average lose $9\\%$ of its\nvalue within minutes, to automated order \"spoofing\" algorithms. In this paper,\nwe build a set of methodologies to characterize and empirically measure\ndifferent algorithmic trading strategies in Binance, a large centralized\ncryptocurrency exchange, using a complete data set of historical trades. We\nfind that a sub-strategy of triangular arbitrage is widespread, where bots\nconvert between two coins through an intermediary coin, and obtain a favorable\nexchange rate compared to the direct one. We measure the profitability of this\nstrategy, characterize its risks, and outline two strategies that algorithmic\ntrading bots use to mitigate their losses. We find that this strategy yields an\nexchange ratio that is $0.144\\%$, or $14.4$ basis points (bps) better than the\ndirect exchange ratio. $2.71\\%$ of all trades on Binance are attributable to\nthis strategy.\n",

Since both curves are generically\nregular, the response to small perturbations is linearly small. However, a\ncrucial ingredient is absent of the theory, namely transactions themselves.\nWhat happens after they occur? To answer the question, we develop a dynamic\ntheory for supply and demand based on agents with heterogeneous beliefs. When\nthe inter-auction time is infinitely long, the Walrasian mechanism is\nrecovered. When transactions are allowed to happen in continuous time, a\npeculiar property emerges: close to the price, supply and demand vanish\nquadratically, which we empirically confirm on the Bitcoin. This explains why\nprice impact in financial markets is universally observed to behave as the\nsquare root of the excess volume. The consequences are important, as they imply\nthat the very fact of clearing the market makes prices hypersensitive to small\nfluctuations.\n",

This important discovery made by Huberman\nand Stanzl and Gatheral favors the transient market impact framework, as linear\npermanent market impact is at odds with reality.

The\npractical implementation of so-called \"optimal strategies\" however suffers from\nthe failure of most order book models to faithfully reproduce the behaviour of\nreal market participants.\n  This paper is twofold. First, some important statistical properties of order\ndriven markets are identified, advocating against the use of purely Markovian\norder book models. Then, market making strategies are designed and their\nperformances are compared, based on simulation as well as backtesting. We find\nthat incorporating some simple non-Markovian features in the limit order book\ngreatly improves the performances of market making strategies in a realistic\ncontext.\n",

We consider a random walk model for the asset price, and\nformulate the market maker's optimization problem using Markov Decision\nProcesses (MDP). We characterize the value of an order and show that it plays\nthe role of one-period reward in the MDP model. Based on this characterization,\nwe provide explicit criteria for assessing the profitability of market making\nwhen there is latency. Under our model, we show that a market maker can earn a\npositive expected profit if there are sufficient uninformed market orders\nhitting the market maker's limit orders compared with the rate of price jumps,\nand the trading horizon is sufficiently long. In addition, our theoretical and\nnumerical results suggest that latency can be an additional source of risk and\nlatency impacts negatively the performance of market makers.\n",

Due to the instantaneity and imperceptibility characteristics of\nintraday stock jumps, relevant studies on their predictability remain limited.\nThis paper proposes a data-driven approach to predict intraday stock jumps\nusing the information embedded in liquidity measures and technical indicators.\nSpecifically, a trading day is divided into a series of 5-minute intervals, and\nat the end of each interval, the candidate attributes defined by liquidity\nmeasures and technical indicators are input into machine learning algorithms to\npredict the arrival of a stock jump as well as its direction in the following\n5-minute interval. Empirical study is conducted on the level-2 high-frequency\ndata of 1271 stocks in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China to validate our\napproach. The result provides initial evidence of the predictability of jump\narrivals and jump directions using level-2 stock data as well as the\neffectiveness of using a combination of liquidity measures and technical\nindicators in this prediction. We also reveal the superiority of using random\nforest compared to other machine learning algorithms in building prediction\nmodels.

Existing momentum trading models suffer from\ntime-lagging caused by the delayed frequency response of digital filters.\nTime-lagging results in a momentum signal of the wrong sign, when the market\nchanges trend direction. A key feature of this state space formulation, is no\nsuch lagging occurs, allowing for accurate shifts in signal sign at market\nchange points. The number of latent states in the model is estimated using\nthree techniques, cross validation, penalized likelihood criteria and\nsimulation-based model selection for the marginal likelihood. All three\ntechniques suggest either 2 or 3 hidden states. Model parameters are then found\nusing Baum-Welch and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, whilst assuming a single\n(discretized) univariate Gaussian distribution for the emission matrix. Often a\nmomentum trader will want to condition their trading signals on additional\ninformation. To reflect this, learning is also carried out in the presence of\nside information. Two sets of side information are considered, namely a ratio\nof realized volatilities and intraday seasonality. It is shown that splines can\nbe used to capture statistically significant relationships from this\ninformation, allowing returns to be predicted. An Input Output Hidden Markov\nModel is used to incorporate these univariate predictive signals into the\ntransition matrix, presenting a possible solution for dealing with the signal\ncombination problem. Bayesian inference is then carried out to predict the\nsecurities $t+1$ return using the forward algorithm.

For best execution, therefore, it may be beneficial to\nopportunistically fill orders with as few counterparts as possible in\nLarge-in-scale (LIS) venues.\n  This article introduces the concept of concentrated trading, a situation that\noccurs when a large fraction of buying or selling in a given time period is\ndone by one or a few traders, for example when executing a large order. Using\nLondon Stock Exchange data, we show that concentrated trading suffers price\nimpact in addition to impact caused by (smart) order routing. However, when\nmatched with similarly concentrated counterparts on the other side of the\nmarket, the impact is greatly reduced. This suggests that exposing an order on\nLIS venues is expected to result in execution performance improvement.\n",

We show\nthat the equilibrium state in this model experience interesting phase\ntransitions, as the weight of the revenue term in the market maker's\nperformance function changes. Specifically, the asset price in equilibrium\nexperience three different phases: a linear pricing rule without a spread, a\npricing rule that includes a linear mid-price and a bid-ask spread, and a\nmetastable state with a zero mid-price and a large spread.\n",

Amongst the numerous problems\naddressed, the optimal execution of large orders is probably the one that has\nattracted the most research works, mainly in the case of single-asset\nportfolios. In practice, however, optimal execution problems often involve\nlarge portfolios comprising numerous assets, and models should consequently\naccount for risks at the portfolio level. In this paper, we address multi-asset\noptimal execution in a model where prices have multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\ndynamics and where the agent maximizes the expected (exponential) utility of\nher PnL. We use the tools of stochastic optimal control and simplify the\ninitial multidimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation into a system of\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) involving a Matrix Riccati ODE for which\nclassical existence theorems do not apply. By using \\textit{a priori} estimates\nobtained thanks to optimal control tools, we nevertheless prove an existence\nand uniqueness result for the latter ODE, and then deduce a verification\ntheorem that provides a rigorous solution to the execution problem. Using\nexamples based on data from the foreign exchange and stock markets, we\neventually illustrate our results and discuss their implications for both\noptimal execution and statistical arbitrage.\n",

The permanent impact generated by an asset in the portfolio\nduring the liquidation will affect all assets, and the temporary impact\ngenerated by one asset will only affect itself.

Built on a strong theoretical foundation, our model provides\ninsights to market participants by splitting the overall move of the security\nprice during the duration of an order into the Market Impact (price move caused\nby their actions) and Market Timing (price move caused by everyone else)\ncomponents. We derive formulations of this model under different laws of motion\nof the security prices, starting with a simple benchmark scenario and extending\nthis to include multiple sources of uncertainty, liquidity constraints due to\nvolume curve shifts and relating trading costs to the spread. We develop a\nnumerical framework that can be used to obtain optimal executions under any law\nof motion of prices and demonstrate the tremendous practical applicability of\nour theoretical methodology including the powerful numerical techniques to\nimplement them. Our decomposition of trading costs into Market Impact and\nMarket Timing allows us to deduce the zero sum game nature of trading costs.

We design a\nnovel methodology that compensates for the lack of data on trading costs in\nChina. We estimate trading costs across similar positions on the dual listed\nset of securities in Hong Kong and China, hoping to provide useful pieces of\ninformation to help scale 'The Great Wall of Chinese Securities Trading Costs'.\nWe then compare actual and estimated trading costs on a sample of real orders\nacross the Hong Kong securities in the dual listed pair to establish the\naccuracy of our measurements. The primary question we seek to address is 'Which\nmarket would be better to trade to gain exposure to the same (or similar) set\nof securities or sectors?' We find that trading costs on Shanghai, which might\nhave been lower than Hong Kong, might have become higher leading up to the\nConnect. What remains to be seen is whether this increase in trading costs is a\ntemporary equilibrium due to the frenzy to gain exposure to Chinese securities\nor whether this phenomenon will persist once the two markets start becoming\nmore and more tightly coupled. It would be interesting to see if this\npioneering policy will lead to securities exchanges across the globe linking up\none another, creating a trade anything, anywhere and anytime marketplace.\nLooking beyond mere trading costs, such studies can be used to gather some\nevidence on what effect the mode of governance and other aspects of life in one\ncountry have on another country, once they start joining up their financial\nmarkets.\n",

There are several hypotheses and\nconspiracy theories arguing that in some situations, brokers want their traders\nto lose money.

Another example is that some brokers take positions\nopposite to their traders', in which case they make money whenever their\ntraders lose money. These are reasons for which brokers might manipulate prices\nin order to maximize the losses of their traders.\n  In this paper, our goal is to perform this shady task optimally -- or at\nleast to check whether this can actually be done algorithmically. Assuming\ntotal control over the price of an asset (ignoring the usual aspects of finance\nsuch as market conditions, external influence or stochasticity), we show how in\nquadratic time, given a set of trades specified by a stop-loss and a\ntake-profit price, a broker can find a maximum loss price movement. We also\nlook at an online trade model where broker and trader exchange turns, each\ntrying to make a profit.

The proposed modeling\nframework is inspired by our previous work [23]. In this framework, the Limit\nOrder Book (LOB) arises as an outcome of an equilibrium between multiple agents\nwho have different beliefs about the future demand for the asset. The agents'\nbeliefs may change according to the information they observe, triggering\nchanges in their behavior. We present an example illustrating how the proposed\nmodels can be used to quantify the consequences of changes in relevant\ninformation signals. If these signals, themselves, depend on the LOB, then, our\napproach allows one to model the \"indirect\" market impact (as opposed to the\n\"direct\" impact that a market order makes on the LOB, by eliminating certain\nlimit orders). On the mathematical side, we formulate the proposed modeling\nframework as a continuum-player control-stopping game. We manage to split the\nequilibrium problem into two parts. The first one is described by a\ntwo-dimensional system of Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations\n(RBSDEs), whose solution components reflect against each other. The second one\nleads to an infinite-dimensional fixed-point problem for a discontinuous\nmapping. Both problems are non-standard, and we prove the existence of their\nsolutions in the paper.\n",

Its shape varies little across instruments, but drastically\ndifferent master curves are obtained for order-volume and -sign impact. The\nscaling is largely determined by the relevant Hurst exponents. We further show\nthat extreme order flow imbalance is not associated with large returns. To the\ncontrary, it is observed when the price is \"pinned\" to a particular level.\nPrices move only when there is sufficient balance in the local order flow. In\nfact, the probability that a trade changes the mid-price falls to zero with\nincreasing (absolute) order-sign bias along an arc-shaped curve for all\nintra-day scales. Our findings challenge the widespread assumption of linear\naggregate impact.

An analysis\nof intraday volumes for the S&P500 constituent stocks illustrates that (i)\nvolume surprises, i.e., deviations from their respective forecasts, are\ncorrelated across stocks, and (ii) this correlation increases during the last\nfew hours of the trading session. These observations could be attributed, in\npart, to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the\ngrowth of ETF, passive and systematic investment strategies; and, to the\nincreased trading intensity of such strategies towards the end of the trading\nsession, e.g., due to execution of mutual fund inflows/outflows that are\nbenchmarked to the closing price on each day. In this paper, we investigate the\nconsequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio\nexecution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model\nthat explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity\nproviders only trade portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We\nfind that due to cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a\nrisk-neutral, cost minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a\ncoupled manner, as opposed to a separable VWAP-like execution that is often\nassumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution of the various orders so as\nto be able to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity towards the end\nof the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from\nthis optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as\n6% for plausible model parameters.

The features of\nleptokurtosis, volatility clustering and aggregational Gaussianity are\nespecially highlighted and studied in detail. The following ingredients are\nfound to be essential for the production of these stylised facts: the memory of\nnoise traders who make random trade decisions; the inclusion of technical\ntraders that trade in line with trends in the price and the inclusion of\nfundamental traders who know the \"fundamental value\" of the stock and trade\naccordingly. When these three basic types of traders are included log returns\nare produced with a leptokurtic distribution and volatility clustering as well\nas some further statistical features of empirical data. This enhances and\nbroadens our understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the\nproduction of empirical data by the market.\n",

The models we propose thus integrate the\ninfluence of both the current book state and the past order flow. The first\nvariant considers the flow of order arrivals at a specific price level as\nindependent from the other one and describes this flow by adding a Hawkes\ncomponent to the arrival rates provided by the continuous time Markov \"Queue\nReactive\" model of Huang et al. Empirical calibration using Level-I order book\ndata from Eurex future assets (Bund and DAX) show that the Hawkes term\ndramatically improves the pure \"Queue-Reactive\" model not only for the\ndescription of the order flow properties (as e.g. the statistics of inter-event\ntimes) but also with respect to the shape of the queue distributions. The\nsecond variant we introduce describes the joint dynamics of all events\noccurring at best bid and ask sides of some order book during a trading day.\nThis model can be considered as a queue dependent extension of the multivariate\nHawkes order-book model of Bacry et al. We provide an explicit way to calibrate\nthis model either with a Maximum-Likelihood method or with a Least-Square\napproach. Empirical estimation from Bund and DAX level-I order book data allow\nus to recover the main features of Hawkes interactions uncovered in Bacry et\nal. but also to unveil their joint dependence on bid and ask queue sizes. We\nnotably find that while the market order or mid-price changes rates can mainly\nbe functions on the volume imbalance this is not the case for the arrival rate\nof limit or cancel orders.

More precisely, for a list of assets, they set\nprices at which they agree to buy and sell. Market makers face therefore an\ninteresting optimization problem: they need to choose bid and ask prices for\nmaking money while mitigating the risk associated with holding inventory in a\nvolatile market. Many market making models have been proposed in the academic\nliterature, most of them dealing with single-asset market making whereas market\nmakers are usually in charge of a long list of assets. The rare models tackling\nmulti-asset market making suffer however from the curse of dimensionality when\nit comes to the numerical approximation of the optimal quotes. The goal of this\npaper is to propose a dimensionality reduction technique to address multi-asset\nmarket making by using a factor model. Moreover, we generalize existing market\nmaking models by the addition of an important feature: the existence of\ndifferent transaction sizes and the possibility for the market makers in OTC\nmarkets to answer different prices to requests with different sizes.\n",

A 2019\nICAART paper by Cliff claimed that AA's failings were revealed by testing it in\nmore realistic experiments, with conditions closer to those found in real\nfinancial markets, but here we demonstrate that even in the simple experiment\nconditions that were used in the original AA papers, exhaustive testing shows\nAA to be outperformed by GDX. We close this paper with a discussion of the\nmethodological implications of our work: any results from previous papers where\nany one trading algorithm is claimed to be superior to others on the basis of\nonly a few thousand trials are probably best treated with some suspicion now.\nThe rise of cloud computing means that the compute-power necessary to subject\ntrading algorithms to millions of trials over a wide range of conditions is\nreadily available at reasonable cost: we should make use of this; exhaustive\ntesting such as is shown here should be the norm in future evaluations and\ncomparisons of new trading algorithms.\n",

The strength of our model lies within the fact that it is very\nsimple and can be calibrated to the market zero yield curve using an analytical\nformula. We run several numerical experiments at two different dates, once with\na partially sub-zero interest rate and once with a fully negative interest\nrate. In both cases, we obtain good results in the sense that the model\nreproduces the market term structures very well. We then simulate the model\nusing the Euler-Maruyama scheme and examine the mean, variance and distribution\nof the model. The latter agrees with the skewness and fat tail seen in the\noriginal CIR model. In addition, we compare the model's zero coupon prices with\nmarket prices at different future points in time. Finally, we test the market\nconsistency of the model by evaluating swaptions with different tenors and\nmaturities.\n",

With ever increasing\ntrading volume, this quoting task has to be done algorithmically in most\nmarkets such as foreign exchange markets or corporate bond markets. Over the\nlast ten years, many mathematical models have been designed that can be the\nbasis of quoting algorithms in dealer markets. Nevertheless, in most (if not\nall) models, the dealer is a pure internalizer, setting quotes and waiting for\nclients. However, on many dealer markets, dealers also have access to an\ninter-dealer market or even public trading venues where they can hedge part of\ntheir inventory. In this paper, we propose a model taking this possibility into\naccount, therefore allowing dealers to externalize part of their risk. The\nmodel displays an important feature well known to practitioners that within a\ncertain inventory range the dealer internalizes the flow by appropriately\nadjusting the quotes and starts externalizing outside of that range. The larger\nthe franchise, the wider is the inventory range suitable for pure\ninternalization. The model is illustrated numerically with realistic parameters\nfor USDCNH spot market.\n",

We argue that because of capacity constraints faced by\nminers, centralization in mining is lower than indicated by both public\ndiscourse and recent academic work. We show that advancements in hardware\nefficiency do not necessarily lead to larger miners increasing their advantage,\nbut rather allow smaller miners to expand and new miners to enter the\ncompetition. Our calibrated model illustrates that hardware efficiency has a\nsmall impact on the cost of attacking a network, while the mining reward has a\nsignificant impact.

On the level of linear response the method allows to include\nthe reaction of the market to individual actions of the agents as well as the\nreaction of the agents to individual information items of the market. This way\nwe derive a self-consistent solution to the minority game. In particular we\nanalyze the impact of general nonlinear price functions on the amount of\narbitrage if noise from external fluctuations is present. We identify the\nconditions under which arbitrage gets reduced due to the presence of noise.\nWhen the cavity method is extended to time dependent response of the market\nprice to previous actions of the agents, the individual contributions of noise\ncan be pursued over different time scales in the transient dynamics until a\nstationary state is reached and when the stationary state is reached. The\ncontributions are from external fluctuations in price and information and from\nnoise due to the choice of strategies. The dynamics explains the time evolution\nof scores of the agents' strategies: it changes from initially a random walk to\nnon-Markovian dynamics and bounded excursions on an intermediate time scale to\neffectively random switching in the choice between strategies on long time\nscales. In contrast to the Curie-Weiss level of a mean-field approach, the\nmarket response included by the cavity method captures the realistic feature\nthat the agents can have a preference for a certain choice of strategies\nwithout getting stuck to a single choice. The breakdown of the method in the\nphase transition region indicates possible market mechanisms leading to\ncritical volatility and a possible regime shift.\n",

Building on this approach, in this paper we introduce\nthree main innovations: (i) we use as data-generating process the\nQueue-Reactive model of the limit order book (Huang et al. (2015)), which -\ncompared to the Zero-Intelligence model - generates more realistic\nmicrostructure dynamics, as shown here by using an Hausman test; (ii) we\nconsider not only estimators of the integrated volatility but also of the spot\nvolatility; (iii) we show the relevance of the estimator in the prediction of\nthe variance of the cost of a simulated VWAP execution. Overall we find that,\nfor the integrated volatility, the pre-averaging estimator optimizes the\nestimation bias, while the unified and the alternation estimator lead to\noptimal mean squared error values. Instead, in the case of the spot volatility,\nthe Fourier estimator yields the optimal accuracy, both in terms of bias and\nmean squared error. The latter estimator leads also to the optimal prediction\nof the cost variance of a VWAP execution.\n",

The first is based on the relationship between past order\nflow and future price change, while in the second we solve an inverse optimal\nexecution problem.

In\nparticular, with reference to years 2020 and 2021, we study the logarithmic US\ndollar price returns of the cryptocurrency trading network using both pairwise\nand high-order statistical dependencies, quantified by Granger causality and\nO-information, respectively. With reference to the former, we find that it\nshows peaks in correspondence of important events, like e.g., Covid-19 pandemic\nturbulence or occasional sudden prices rise. The corresponding network\nstructure is rather stable, across weekly time windows in the period considered\nand the coins are the most influential nodes in the network. In the pairwise\ndescription of the network, stable coins seem to play a marginal role whereas,\nturning high-order dependencies, they appear in the highest number of\nsynergistic information circuits, thus proving that they play a major role for\nhigh order effects. With reference to redundancy and synergy with the time\nevolution of the total transactions in US dollars, we find that their large\nvolume in the first semester of 2021 seems to have triggered a transition in\nthe cryptocurrency network toward a more complex dynamical landscape.

We construct a stochastic equilibrium model\ndescribing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading and compute\ninvestment equilibria under different contracting regimes. Two policy\nrecommendations result. First, to avoid creating inefficiency by crowding out\nother forms of risk sharing, system operators should allow resources contracted\nthrough other means to opt out of mandatory capacity mechanisms, with their\ncontribution to those requirements subtracted from administratively defined\ndemand curves. Second, if they wish to promote a single contractual form,\nregulators should consider replacing existing option-like capacity mechanisms\nwith a shaped forward contract for energy. Beyond these recommendations, we\ndiscuss the tension that liberalized systems face in seeking to promote both\nreliability and competitive outcomes.\n",

        "summary": "  Finance is a particularly difficult playground for deep reinforcement\nlearning. However, establishing high-quality market environments and benchmarks\nfor financial reinforcement learning is challenging due to three major factors,\nnamely, low signal-to-noise ratio of financial data, survivorship bias of\nhistorical data, and model overfitting in the backtesting stage. In this paper,\nwe present an openly accessible FinRL-Meta library that has been actively\nmaintained by the AI4Finance community. First, following a DataOps paradigm, we\nwill provide hundreds of market environments through an automatic pipeline that\ncollects dynamic datasets from real-world markets and processes them into\ngym-style market environments. Second, we reproduce popular papers as stepping\nstones for users to design new trading strategies. We also deploy the library\non cloud platforms so that users can visualize their own results and assess the\nrelative performance via community-wise competitions. Third, FinRL-Meta\nprovides tens of Jupyter/Python demos organized into a curriculum and a\ndocumentation website to serve the rapidly growing community.

The most popular Automated Market Makers\nare Constant Function Market Makers. They have been studied both theoretically\nand empirically. In particular, the concept of impermanent loss has emerged and\nexplains part of the profit and loss of liquidity providers in Constant\nFunction Market Makers. In this paper, we propose another mechanism in which\nprice discovery does not solely rely on liquidity takers but also on an\nexternal exchange rate or price oracle. We also propose to compare the\ndifferent mechanisms from the point of view of liquidity providers by using a\nmean / variance analysis of their profit and loss compared to that of agents\nholding assets outside of Automated Market Makers. In particular, inspired by\nMarkowitz' modern portfolio theory, we manage to obtain an efficient frontier\nfor the performance of liquidity providers in the idealized case of a perfect\noracle. Beyond that idealized case, we show that even when the oracle is lagged\nand in the presence of adverse selection by liquidity takers and systematic\narbitrageurs, optimized oracle-based mechanisms perform better than popular\nConstant Function Market Makers.\n",

Order internalization is captured by a\nmodel of market makers competing for the retail order flow in a Bertrand\nfashion. On the other hand, the price-taking competitive liquidity providers\ncharacterize the open exchange model. We show that, when liquidity providers\nare risk averse, routing of the marketable orders to the wholesalers is\npreferred by all retail traders: informed, uninformed and noisy. The\nunwillingness of liquidity providers to bear risk causes the strategic trader\n(informed or not) to absorb large shocks in their inventories. This results in\nmean reverting inventories, price reversal, and lower market depth. The\nequilibria in both models coincide with Kyle (1985) when liquidity providers\nare risk neutral. We also identify a universal parameter that allows comparison\nof market liquidity, profit and value of information across different markets.\n",

Recognizing that the riskless interest rate\nfluctuates over time, we leverage the Black-Derman-Toy model to trace its\ntemporal evolution. To gain insights from a bond trader's perspective, we focus\non a specific type of bond: the zero-coupon bond. This paper introduces a\npricing algorithm for this bond and presents a formula that can be used to\nascertain its real value. By crafting an equation that juxtaposes the\ntheoretical value of a zero-coupon bond with its actual value, we can deduce\nthe risk-neutral probability. It is noteworthy that the risk-neutral\nprobability correlates with variables like the instantaneous mean return,\ninstantaneous volatility, and inherent upturn probability in the equity market.\nExamining these relationships enables us to discern the temporal shifts in\nthese parameters. Our findings suggest that the mean starts at a negative\nvalue, eventually plateauing at a consistent level. The volatility, on the\nother hand, initially has a minimal positive value, peaks swiftly, and then\nstabilizes. Lastly, the upturn probability is initially significantly high,\nplunges rapidly, and ultimately reaches equilibrium.\n",

MFINs extend Deep Inception Networks (DIN) to\noperate in a multi-factor context. Similar to DINs, MFIN models automatically\nlearn features from returns data and output position sizes that optimise\nportfolio Sharpe ratio. Compared to a range of rule-based momentum and\nreversion strategies, MFINs learn an uncorrelated, higher-Sharpe strategy that\nis not captured by traditional, hand-crafted factors. In particular, MFIN\nmodels continue to achieve consistent returns over the most recent years\n(2022-2023), where traditional strategies and the wider cryptocurrency market\nhave underperformed.\n",

In this work, we seek to analyse\nthe nuances of the relationship between prices and volume imbalance. To this\nend, we study a market-making problem which allows us to view the imbalance as\nan optimal response to price moves. In our model, there is an underlying\nefficient price driving the mid-price, which follows the model with uncertainty\nzones. A single market maker knows the underlying efficient price and\nconsequently the probability of a mid-price jump in the future. She controls\nthe volumes she quotes at the best bid and ask prices. Solving her optimization\nproblem allows us to understand endogenously the price-imbalance connection and\nto confirm in particular that it is optimal to quote a predictive imbalance.\nOur model can also be used by a platform to select a suitable tick size, which\nis known to be a crucial topic in financial regulation. The value function of\nthe market maker's control problem can be viewed as a family of functions,\nindexed by the level of the market maker's inventory, solving a coupled system\nof PDEs. We show existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to this\ncoupled system of equations. In the case of a continuous inventory, we also\nprove uniqueness of the market maker's optimal control policy.\n",

Reinforcement learning (RL)\nin financial research has shown stellar performance on many quantitative\ntrading tasks. However, most methods focus on low-frequency trading, e.g.,\nday-level, which cannot be directly applied to HFT because of two challenges.\nFirst, RL for HFT involves dealing with extremely long trajectories (e.g., 2.4\nmillion steps per month), which is hard to optimize and evaluate. Second, the\ndramatic price fluctuations and market trend changes of Crypto make existing\nalgorithms fail to maintain satisfactory performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose an Efficient hieArchical Reinforcement learNing method\nfor High Frequency Trading (EarnHFT), a novel three-stage hierarchical RL\nframework for HFT. In stage I, we compute a Q-teacher, i.e., the optimal action\nvalue based on dynamic programming, for enhancing the performance and training\nefficiency of second-level RL agents. In stage II, we construct a pool of\ndiverse RL agents for different market trends, distinguished by return rates,\nwhere hundreds of RL agents are trained with different preferences of return\nrates and only a tiny fraction of them will be selected into the pool based on\ntheir profitability. In stage III, we train a minute-level router which\ndynamically picks a second-level agent from the pool to achieve stable\nperformance across different markets. Through extensive experiments in various\nmarket trends on Crypto markets in a high-fidelity simulation trading\nenvironment, we demonstrate that EarnHFT significantly outperforms 6\nstate-of-art baselines in 6 popular financial criteria, exceeding the runner-up\nby 30% in profitability.\n",

Using\nLandauer's principle, which posits that time-irreversible information\nprocessing consumes energy, we establish a thermodynamically consistent measure\nof cognitive energy cost associated with belief dynamics. We utilize this\nconcept to analyze a two-armed bandit game, a standard decision-making\nframework under uncertainty, considering exploitation, finite memory, and\nconcurrent allocation to both game options or arms. Through exploitative,\nprediction-error-based belief dynamics, the decision maker incurs a cognitive\nenergy cost. Initially, we observe the rise of dissipative structures in the\nsteady state of the belief space due to time-reversal symmetry breaking at\nintermediate exploitative levels. To delve deeper into the belief dynamics, we\nliken it to the behavior of an active particle subjected to state-dependent\nnoise. This analogy enables us to relate emergent risk aversion to standard\nthermophoresis, connecting two apparently unrelated concepts. Finally, we\nnumerically compute the time irreversibility of belief dynamics in the steady\nstate, revealing a strong correlation between elevated - yet optimized -\ncognitive energy cost and optimal decision-making outcomes. This correlation\nsuggests a mechanism for the evolution of living systems towards maximally\nout-of-equilibrium structures.\n",

Financial markets\nfeature a constrained action space that should simplify model creation, produce\na wealth of data that should aid model validation, and a successful ABFM could\nstrongly impact system design and policy development processes.

Second, the simple agents that commonly populate ABFMs do\nnot display the breadth of behaviors observed in human traders or the trading\nsystems that they create.

Some systems are however both hard to simulate and very sensitive to\nsmall perturbations. An additional difficulty arises when an RL agent must\nlearn to be part of a multi-agent system using only anonymous data, which makes\nit impossible to infer the state of each agent, thus to use data directly.\nTypical examples are competitive systems without agent-resolved data such as\nfinancial markets. We introduce consistent data time travel for offline RL as a\nremedy for these problems: instead of using historical data in a sequential\nway, we argue that one needs to perform time travel in historical data, i.e.,\nto adjust the time index so that both the past state and the influence of the\nRL agent's action on the state coincide with real data. This both alleviates\nthe need to resort to imperfect models and consistently accounts for both the\nimmediate and long-term reactions of the system when using anonymous historical\ndata. We apply this idea to market making in limit order books, a notoriously\ndifficult task for RL; it turns out that the gain of the agent is significantly\nhigher with data time travel than with naive sequential data, which suggests\nthat the difficulty of this task for RL may have been overestimated.\n",

The second paper, introduces computational methods based on Fourier\nSeries which allows the introduction of a broad range of constraints into the\noptimal strategies derived. The current paper returns to the unconstrained case\nand provides a complete solution to finding equilibrium strategies in\ncompetition and handles completely arbitrary situations. As a result we present\na detailed analysis of the value (or not) of trade centralization and we show\nthat firms who naively centralize trades do not generally benefit and\nsometimes, in fact, lose. On the other hand, firms that strategically\ncentralize their trades generally will be able to benefit.\n",

Perpetual Futures\n(henceforth Perps) are financial derivatives introduced by the economist Robert\nShiller, designed to peg their price to that of the underlying Spot market.\nThis paper extends the limit order book model of Chiarella et al. (2002) by\ntaking their agent and orderbook parameters, designed for a simple stock\nexchange, and applying it to the more complex environment of a Perp market with\nlong and short traders who exhibit both positional and basis-trading behaviors.\nI find that despite the simplicity of the agent behavior, the simulation is\nable to reproduce the most salient feature of a Perp market, the pegging of the\nPerp price to the underlying Spot price. In contrast to fundamental simulations\nof stock markets which aim to reproduce empirically observed stylized facts\nsuch as the leptokurtosis and heteroscedasticity of returns, volatility\nclustering and others, in derivatives markets many of these features are\nprovided exogenously by the underlying Spot price signal. This is especially\ntrue of Perps since the derivative is designed to mimic the price of the Spot\nmarket. Therefore, this paper will focus exclusively on analyzing how market\nand agent parameters such as order lifetime, trading horizon and spread affect\nthe premiums at which Perps trade with respect to the underlying Spot market. I\nshow that this simulation provides a simple and robust environment for\nexploring the dynamics of Perpetual Futures markets and their microstructure in\nthis regard. Lastly, I explore the ability of the model to reproduce the\neffects of biasing long traders to trade positionally and short traders to\nbasis-trade, which was the original intention behind the market design, and is\na tendency observed empirically in real Perp markets.\n",

We distinguish two\npossibilities for modeling the resilience of the LOB after a large market\norder: the exponential recovery of the number of limit orders, i.e., of the\nvolume of the LOB, or the exponential recovery of the bid-ask spread. We\nconsider both of these resilience modes and, in each case, derive explicit\noptimal execution strategies in discrete time. Applying our results to a\nblock-shaped LOB, we obtain a new closed-form representation for the optimal\nstrategy, which explicitly solves the recursive scheme given in Obizhaeva and\nWang (2005). We also provide some evidence for the robustness of optimal\nstrategies with respect to the choice of the shape function and the\nresilience-type.\n",

Econophysical analyses of transaction data for the US and Australian\nstock markets have uncovered market-specific scaling laws, where a master curve\nof price impact can be obtained in each market when stock capitalization $C$ is\nincluded as an argument in the scaling relation. However, the rationale of\nintroducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalous\nnegative correlation between price change $r$ and trade size $\\omega$ for small\ntrades is unexplained. Here we show that these issues can be addressed by\ntaking into account the aggressiveness of orders that result in trades together\nwith a proper normalization technique. Using order book data from the Chinese\nmarket, we show that trades from filled and partially filled limit orders have\nvery different price impact. The price impact of trades from partially filled\norders is constant when the volume is not too large, while that of filled\norders shows power-law behavior $r\\sim \\omega^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha\\approx2/3$.\nWhen returns and volumes are normalized by stock-dependent averages,\ncapitalization-independent scaling laws emerge for both types of trades.\nHowever, no scaling relation in terms of stock capitalization can be\nconstructed. In addition, the relation $\\alpha=\\alpha_\\omega/\\alpha_r$ is\nverified, where $\\alpha_\\omega$ and $\\alpha_r$ are the tail exponents of trade\nsizes and returns. These observations also enable us to explain the anomalous\nnegative correlation between $r$ and $\\omega$ for small-size trades. We\nanticipate that these regularities may hold in other order-driven markets.\n",

The price of the asset is influenced by both an external\ninformation stream and the demand of the agents. The current strategy of each\nagent is defined by a pair of moving thresholds straddling the current price.\nWhen the price crosses either of the thresholds for a particular agent, that\nagent switches position and a new pair of thresholds is generated.\n  Different kinds of threshold motion correspond to different sources of\nmotivation, running the gamut from purely rational information-processing,\nthrough rational (but often undesirable) behaviour induced by perverse\nincentives and moral hazards, to purely psychological effects. As with the\nprevious class of models, the fact that the simplest model of this kind\nprecisely conforms to the Efficient Market Hypothesis allows causal\nrelationships to be established between properties at the agent level and\nviolations of EMH price statistics at the global level.\n",

Agents are assumed to have three components to the expectation of future\nasset returns, namely-fundamentalist, chartist and noise trader. Furthermore\nagents differ in the characteristics describing these components, such as time\nhorizon, risk aversion and the weights given to the various components. The\nmodel developed here extends a great deal of earlier literature in that the\norder submissions of agents are determined by utility maximisation, rather than\nthe mechanical unit order size that is commonly assumed. In this way the order\nflow is better related to the ongoing evolution of the market. For the given\nmarket structure we analyze the impact of the three components of the trading\nstrategies on the statistical properties of prices and order flows and observe\nthat it is the chartist strategy that is mainly responsible of the fat tails\nand clustering in the artificial price data generated by the model. The paper\nprovides further evidence that large price changes are likely to be generated\nby the presence of large gaps in the book.\n",

Different components\nand/or aspects of real-world financial markets are modelled by these games. In\nthe MG, agents compete for scarce resources; in the MAJG gents imitate the\ngroup in the hope of exploiting a trend; in the $G agents attempt to\nsuccessfully predict and benefit from trends as well as changes in the\ndirection of a market. It has been previously shown that in the MG for a\nreasonable number of preliminary time steps preceding equilibrium (Time Horizon\nMG, THMG), agents' attempt to optimize their gains by active strategy selection\nis ``illusory'': The calculated hypothetical gains of their individual\nstrategies is greater on average than agents' actual average gains.\nFurthermore, if a small proportion of agents deliberately choose and act in\naccord with their seemingly worst performing strategy, these outper-form all\nother agents on average, and even attain mean positive gain, otherwise rare for\nagents in the MG. This latter phenomenon raises the question as to how well the\noptimization procedure works in the MAJG and $G. We demonstrate that the\nillusion of control is absent in MAJG and $G. In other words, low-entropy (more\ninformative) strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies in\nthe MG but outperform them in the MAJG and $G.

Current research relates to autonomous\ntransaction systems programmed in certain periods and some algorithms. This\noffers return opportunities where traders can not intervene. There are about\nthirty algorithms to assist the traders, the best known are the VWAP, the TWAP,\nTVOL. The algorithms offer the latest strategies and decision-making are the\nsubject of much research. These advances in modeling decision-making autonomous\nagent can envisage a rich future for these technologies, the players already in\nuse for more than 30% of their trading.\n",

In the first stage one finds an\nagent-based model that describes the present state of the investors' beliefs,\nperspectives or strategies. The dynamics is inspired by a model for describing\npredator-prey population evolution: agents change their mind through self- or\nmutual interaction, and the decision is adopted on a random basis, with no\ndirect influence of the price itself. One of the most appealing properties of\nsuch a system is the presence of large oscillations in the number of agents\nsharing the same perspective, what may be linked with the existence of bullish\nand bearish periods in financial markets. In the second stage one has the\npricing mechanism, which will be driven by the relative population in the\ndifferent investors' groups. The price equation will depend on the specific\nnature of the species, and thus it may change from one market to the other: we\nwill firstly present a simple model of excess demand, and subsequently consider\na more elaborate liquidity model. The outcomes of both models are analysed and\ncompared.\n",

To make the microscopic model of double-auction markets having\nstochastic Bid-Ask spread, we use the minority game with a finite market\nhistory length and find numerically that appropriate extension of the game\nshows quite similar behaviour of the response function to the empirical\nevidence.

For all these trading networks, we find that the node degree and node\nstrength both have tails following a power-law distribution. Compared with\nnon-manipulated stocks, manipulated stocks have a high lower bound of the\npower-law tail, a high average degree of the trading network and a low\ncorrelation between the price return and the seller-buyer ratio. These findings\nmay help us to detect manipulated stocks.\n",

This general,\nnon-martingale framework allows a market-maker to make directional bets on\nmarket trends whilst keeping under control her inventory risk. In order to\nachieve this, the marker-maker places non-symmetric limit orders that favour\nmarket orders to hit her bid (resp. ask) quotes if she expects that prices will\ngo up (resp. down).\n  With this inventory-risk-aversion parameter, the market-maker has not only\ndirect control on her inventory risk but she also has indirect control on the\nmoments of her PNL distribution. Therefore, this parameter can be seen as a\nfine-tuning of the marker-maker's risk-reward profile.\n  In the case of a mean-reverting mid-price, we show numerically that the\ninventory-risk-aversion parameter gives the market-maker enough room to tailor\nher risk-reward profile, depending on her risk budgets in inventory and PNL\ndistribution (especially variance, skewness, kurtosis and VaR). For example,\nwhen compared to the martingale benchmark, a market can choose to either\nincrease her average PNL by more than 15% and carry a huge risk, on inventory\nand PNL, or either give up 5% of her benchmark PNL to increase her control on\ninventory and PNL, as well as increasing her Sharpe ratio by a factor bigger\nthan 2.\n",

A popular idea that is based on this seemingly\nintuitive notion is to dampen electric power fluctuations from fluctuating\nsources (as e.g. wind or solar) via a market mechanism, namely by variable\npower prices that adapt demand to supply. The standard model of an average\neconomic agent predicts that fluctuations are reduced by such an adaptive\npricing mechanism.\n  However, the underlying assumption that the actions of all agents average out\non the time axis is not always true in a market of many agents. We numerically\nstudy an econophysics agent model of an adaptive power market that does not\nassume averaging a priori. We find that when agents are exposed to source noise\nvia correlated price fluctuations (as adaptive pricing schemes suggest), the\nmarket may amplify those fluctuations. In particular, small price changes may\ntranslate to large load fluctuations through catastrophic consumer\nsynchronization. As a result, an adaptive power market may cause the opposite\neffect than intended: Power fluctuations are not dampened but amplified\ninstead.\n",

Our main goal is to single out\nproperties that need to be imposed on the decay kernel so that the model admits\nwell-behaved optimal trade execution strategies. We first show that the\nexistence of such strategies is guaranteed by assuming that the decay kernel\ncorresponds to a matrix-valued positive definite function. An example\nillustrates, however, that positive definiteness alone does not guarantee that\noptimal strategies are well-behaved. Building on previous results from the\none-dimensional case, we investigate a class of nonincreasing, nonnegative and\nconvex decay kernels with values in the symmetric $K\\times K$ matrices. We show\nthat these decay kernels are always positive definite and characterize when\nthey are even strictly positive definite, a result that may be of independent\ninterest. Optimal strategies for kernels from this class are well-behaved when\none requires that the decay kernel is also commuting. We show how such decay\nkernels can be constructed by means of matrix functions and provide a number of\nexamples. In particular we completely solve the case of matrix exponential\ndecay.\n",

The basic idea is that\nmost of the daily liquidity is \"latent\" and furthermore vanishes linearly\naround the current price, as a consequence of the diffusion of the price\nitself. However, the numerical implementation of Toth et al. was criticised as\nbeing unrealistic, in particular because all the \"intelligence\" was conferred\nto market orders, while limit orders were passive and random. In this work, we\nstudy various alternative specifications of the model, for example allowing\nlimit orders to react to the order flow, or changing the execution protocols.\nBy and large, our study lends strong support to the idea that the square-root\nimpact law is a very generic and robust property that requires very few\ningredients to be valid. We also show that the transition from super-diffusion\nto sub-diffusion reported in Toth et al. is in fact a cross-over, but that the\noriginal model can be slightly altered in order to give rise to a genuine phase\ntransition, which is of interest on its own. We finally propose a general\ntheoretical framework to understand how a non-linear impact may appear even in\nthe limit where the bias in the order flow is vanishingly small.\n",

By incorporating\nmulti-market into the evolutionary minority game, we investigate the effects of\ninvestor beliefs on the evolution of collective behaviors and asset prices.\nWhen there exists another investment opportunity, market confidence, including\noverconfidence and under-confidence, is not always good or bad for investment.\nThe roles of market confidence is closely related to market impact. For low\nmarket impact, overconfidence in a particular asset makes an investor become\ninsensitive to losses and a delayed strategy adjustment leads to a decline in\nwealth, and thereafter, one's runaway from the market. For high market impact,\nunder-confidence in a particular asset makes an investor over-sensitive to\nlosses and one's too frequent strategy adjustment leads to a large fluctuation\nin asset prices, and thereafter, a decrease in the number of agents. At an\nintermediate market impact, the phase transition occurs. No matter what the\nmarket impact is, an equilibrium between different markets exists, which is\nreflected in the occurrence of similar price fluctuations in different markets.\nA theoretical analysis indicates that such an equilibrium results from the\ncoupled effects of strategy updating and shift in investment. The runaway of\nthe agents trading a specific asset will lead to a decline in the asset price\nvolatility and such a decline will be inhibited by the clustering of the\nstrategies. A uniform strategy distribution will lead to a large fluctuation in\nasset prices and such a fluctuation will be suppressed by the decrease in the\nnumber of agents in the market.

In a\nfully general setting, without imposing any semimartingale restriction, we\nprove that there are no sure profits via flash strategies if and only if asset\nprices do not exhibit predictable jumps. This result relies on the general\ntheory of processes and provides the most general formulation of the well-known\nfact that, in an arbitrage-free financial market, asset prices (including\ndividends) should not exhibit jumps of a predictable direction or magnitude at\npredictable times. We furthermore show that any price process is always\nright-continuous in the absence of sure profits. Our results are robust under\nsmall transaction costs and imply that, under minimal assumptions, price\nchanges occurring at scheduled dates should only be due to unanticipated\ninformation releases.\n",

We first derive the time-evolution equation for the\nphase-space distribution for the HFT model exactly, which corresponds to the\nLiouville equation in conventional analytical mechanics. By a systematic\nreduction of the Liouville equation for the HFT model, the\nBogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchal equations are derived for\nfinancial Brownian motion.

To this end, we designed, implemented,\nand assessed a hybrid micro-macro agent-based model, where price impact arises\nendogenously through the limit order placement activity of algorithmic traders.\nOur novel hybrid microscopic and macroscopic model allows us to quantify\nsystemic risk not just in terms of system stability, but also in terms of the\nspeed of financial distress propagation over intraday timescales. We find that\nsystemic risk is strongly dependent on the behaviour of algorithmic traders, on\nleverage management practices, and on network topology. Our results demonstrate\nthat, for high-crowding regimes, contagion speed is a non-monotone function of\nportfolio diversification. We also find the surprising result that, in certain\ncircumstances, increased portfolio crowding is beneficial to systemic\nstability. We are not aware of previous studies that have exhibited this\nphenomenon, and our results establish the importance of considering non-uniform\nasset allocations in future studies. Finally, we characterise the time window\navailable for regulatory interventions during the propagation of flash crash\ndistress, with results suggesting ex ante precautions may have higher efficacy\nthan ex post reactions.\n",

Various public-domain trading algorithms have\nbeen proposed over the past 25 years in a kind of arms-race, where each new\ntrading algorithm was compared to the previous best, thereby establishing a\n\"pecking order\", i.e. a partially-ordered dominance hierarchy from best to\nworst of the various trading algorithms. Many of these algorithms were\ndeveloped and tested using simple minimal simulations of financial markets that\nonly weakly approximated the fact that real markets involve many different\ntrading systems operating asynchronously and in parallel. In this paper we use\nBSE, a public-domain market simulator, to run a set of experiments generating\nbenchmark results from several well-known trading algorithms. BSE incorporates\na very simple time-sliced approach to simulating parallelism, which has obvious\nknown weaknesses. We then alter and extend BSE to make it threaded, so that\ndifferent trader algorithms operate asynchronously and in parallel: we call\nthis simulator Threaded-BSE (TBSE). We then re-run the trader experiments on\nTBSE and compare the TBSE results to our earlier benchmark results from BSE.\nOur comparison shows that the dominance hierarchy in our more realistic\nexperiments is different from the one given by the original simple simulator.\nWe conclude that simulated parallelism matters a lot, and that earlier results\nfrom simple simulations comparing different trader algorithms are no longer to\nbe entirely trusted.\n",

The primary objective of this research was to shed light\nupon this field by providing a generic methodology that was\ninvestigation-agnostic and interpretable to a financial markets practitioner,\nthus enhancing their efficiency, reducing barriers to entry, and increasing the\nreproducibility of experiments. The proposed methodology is showcased on two\nautomated trading platform components. Namely, price levels, a well-known\ntrading pattern, and a novel 2-step feature extraction method. The methodology\nrelies on hypothesis testing, which is widely applied in other social and\nscientific disciplines to effectively evaluate the concrete results beyond\nsimple classification accuracy. The main hypothesis was formulated to evaluate\nwhether the selected trading pattern is suitable for use in the machine\nlearning setting. Across the experiments we found that the use of the\nconsidered trading pattern in the machine learning setting is only partially\nsupported by statistics, resulting in insignificant effect sizes (Rebound 7 -\n$0.64 \\pm 1.02$, Rebound 11 $0.38 \\pm 0.98$, and rebound 15 - $1.05 \\pm 1.16$),\nbut allowed the rejection of the null hypothesis.

The natural framework we use is mean field game theory, a class of\nstochastic differential games with a continuum of anonymous players.

According to the model, in markets\nwith Institutional Investors only we show the existence of inefficient\nliquidity imbalances in equilibrium, with two symmetrical situations\ncorresponding to what we call liquidity calls for liquidity. During these\nsituations the transaction price significantly moves away from the fair price.\nHowever this macro phenomenon disappears in markets with both Institutional\nInvestors and HFT, although a more precise study shows that the benefits of the\nnew situation go to HFT only, leaving Institutional Investors even with higher\ntrading costs.\n",

One\nof the main features of such models is to encode not only the influence of past\nevents on future events but also, crucially, the influence of past price\nchanges on such events. We show that the empirically calibrated quadratic\nkernel is well described by a diagonal contribution (that captures past\nrealised volatility), plus a rank-one \"Zumbach\" contribution (that captures the\neffect of past trends). We find that the Zumbach kernel is a power-law of time,\nas are all other feedback kernels. As in many previous studies, the rate of\ntruly exogenous events is found to be a small fraction of the total event rate.\nThese two features suggest that the system is close to a critical point -- in\nthe sense that stronger feedback kernels would lead to instabilities.\n",

Both the stock price\nmovement and the investors' global behavior are found to be closely related to\nthe phase region they fall into. Within the region where the market impact is\nsmall, investors' asymmetric response to gains and losses leads to the\noccurrence of herd behavior, when all the investors are prone to behave\nsimilarly in an extreme way and large price fluctuations occur. A linear\nrelation between the standard deviation of stock price changes and the mean\nvalue of strategies is found. With full market impact, the investors tend to\nself-segregate into opposing groups and the introduction of asymmetric\nsensitivity leads to the disappearance of dominant strategies. Compared with\nthe situations in the stock market with little market impact, the stock price\nfluctuations are suppressed and an efficient market occurs. Theoretical\nanalyses indicate that the mechanism of phase transition from clustering to\nself-segregation in the present model is similar to that in the\nmajority-minority game and the occurrence and disappearance of efficient\nmarkets are related to the competition between the trend-following and the\ntrend-aversion forces. The clustering of the strategies in the present model\nresults from the majority-wins effect and the wealth-driven mechanism makes the\nmarket become predictable.\n",

Therefore, this paper\nproposes a deep reinforcement learning based trading agent that can manage the\nportfolio considering not only profit maximization but also risk restraint.

As a experimental result,\nduring the test period, our agents achieved a return of 1800% and provided the\nleast risky investment strategy among the existing methods.

Many quantitative analysts have used machine learning-based methods\nto find unknown profitable market rules from large amounts of market data.\nHowever, there are several challenges in financial markets hindering practical\napplications of machine learning-based models. First, in financial markets,\nthere is no single model that can consistently make accurate prediction because\ntraders in markets quickly adapt to newly available information. Instead, there\nare a number of ephemeral and partially correct models called \"alpha factors\".\nSecond, since financial markets are highly uncertain, ensuring interpretability\nof prediction models is quite important to make reliable trading strategies. To\novercome these challenges, we propose the Trader-Company method, a novel\nevolutionary model that mimics the roles of a financial institute and traders\nbelonging to it. Our method predicts future stock returns by aggregating\nsuggestions from multiple weak learners called Traders. A Trader holds a\ncollection of simple mathematical formulae, each of which represents a\ncandidate of an alpha factor and would be interpretable for real-world\ninvestors. The aggregation algorithm, called a Company, maintains multiple\nTraders. By randomly generating new Traders and retraining them, Companies can\nefficiently find financially meaningful formulae whilst avoiding overfitting to\na transient state of the market.

Most major financial markets now\ninvolve many \"robot traders\", autonomous adaptive software agents, rather than\nhumans. This paper explores how to give such trader-agents a reliable\nanticipatory sensitivity to block orders, such that markets populated entirely\nby robot traders also show market-impact effects. In a 2019 publication Church\n& Cliff presented initial results from a simple deterministic robot trader,\nISHV, which exhibits this market impact effect via monitoring a metric of\nimbalance between supply and demand in the market. The novel contributions of\nour paper are: (a) we critique the methods used by Church & Cliff, revealing\nthem to be weak, and argue that a more robust measure of imbalance is required;\n(b) we argue for the use of multi-level order-flow imbalance (MLOFI: Xu et al.,\n2019) as a better basis for imbalance-sensitive robot trader-agents; and (c) we\ndemonstrate the use of the more robust MLOFI measure in extending ISHV, and\nalso the well-known AA and ZIP trading-agent algorithms (which have both been\npreviously shown to consistently outperform human traders). We demonstrate that\nthe new imbalance-sensitive trader-agents introduced here do exhibit market\nimpact effects, and hence are better-suited to operating in markets where\nimpact is a factor of concern or interest, but do not suffer the weaknesses of\nthe methods used by Church & Cliff.

Due to fluctuations in power supply and demand, there is often an\nimbalance that leads to different prices in the two markets, providing an\nopportunity for arbitrage. To address this issue, we restructure the problem\nand propose a collaborative dual-agent reinforcement learning approach for this\nbi-level simulation and optimization of European power arbitrage trading. We\nalso introduce two new implementations designed to incorporate domain-specific\nknowledge by imitating the trading behaviours of power traders. By utilizing\nreward engineering to imitate domain expertise, we are able to reform the\nreward system for the RL agent, which improves convergence during training and\nenhances overall performance. Additionally, the tranching of orders increases\nbidding success rates and significantly boosts profit and loss (P&L). Our study\ndemonstrates that by leveraging domain expertise in a general learning problem,\nthe performance can be improved substantially, and the final integrated\napproach leads to a three-fold improvement in cumulative P&L compared to the\noriginal agent. Furthermore, our methodology outperforms the highest benchmark\npolicy by around 50% while maintaining efficient computational performance.\n",

At the primary venue, trading yields a linear price impact. In the dark\npool, no price impact costs arise but order execution is uncertain, modeled by\na multi-dimensional Poisson process. We characterize the costs of trading by a\nlinear-quadratic functional which incorporates both the price impact costs of\ntrading at the primary exchange and the market risk of the position. The\nliquidation constraint implies a singularity of the value function of the\nresulting minimization problem at the terminal time T. Via the HJB equation and\na quadratic ansatz, we obtain a candidate for the value function which is the\nlimit of a sequence of solutions of initial value problems for a matrix\ndifferential equation. We show that this limit exists by using an appropriate\nmatrix inequality and a comparison result for Riccati matrix equations.\nAdditionally, we obtain upper and lower bounds of the solutions of the initial\nvalue problems, which allow us to prove a verification theorem. If a single\nasset position is to be liquidated, the investor slowly trades out of her\nposition at the primary venue, with the remainder being placed in the dark pool\nat any point in time. For multi-asset liquidations this is generally not the\ncase; it can, e.g., be optimal to oversize orders in the dark pool in order to\nturn a poorly balanced portfolio into a portfolio bearing less risk.\n",

We establish existence and uniqueness of\nequilibrium for virtually any penalty function when noise is uniform. In\nequilibrium, the demand of the insider and the price functions are in general\nnon-linear and remain analytically tractable because the expected price\nfunction is linear. We use this result to investigate the trade off between\nprice efficiency and 'fairness': we consider a regulator that wants to minimise\npost-trade standard deviation for a given level of uninformed traders' losses.\nThe minimisation is over the function space of penalties; for each possible\npenalty, our existence and uniqueness theorem allows to define unambiguously\nthe post-trade standard deviation and the uninformed traders' losses that\nprevail in equilibrium.Optimal penalties are characterized in closed-form. They\nmust increase quickly with the magnitude of the insider's order for small\norders and become flat for large orders: in cases where the fundamental\nrealizes at very high or very low values, the insider finds it optimal to trade\ndespite the high penalty. Although such trades-if they occur-are costly for\nliquidity traders, they signal extreme events and therefore incorporate a lot\nof information into prices. We generalize this result in two directions by\nimposing a budget constraint on the regulator and considering the cases of\neither non-pecuniary or pecuniary penalties. In the first case, we establish\nthat optimal penalties are a subset of the previously optimal penalties: the\npatterns of equilibrium trade volumes and prices is unchanged. In the second\ncase, we also fully characterize the constrained efficient points and penalties\nand show that new patterns emerge in the demand schedules of the insider trader\nand the associated price functions.\n",

In our model, the stablecoin supply is decided by\nspeculators who optimize the profitability of a leveraged position while\nincorporating the forward-looking cost of collateral liquidations, which\ninvolves the endogenous price of the stablecoin. We formally characterize\nregimes that are interpreted as stable and unstable for the stablecoin. We\nprove bounds on quadratic variation and the probability of large deviations in\nthe stable domain and we demonstrate distinctly greater price variance in the\nunstable domain. We identify a deflationary deleveraging spiral by means of a\nsubmartingale. These deleveraging spirals, which resemble short squeezes, lead\nto faster collateral drawdown (and potential shortfalls) and are accompanied by\nhigher price variance, as experienced on Black Thursday. We conclude by\ndiscussing non-custodial ways in which the issues raised in this paper can be\nmitigated.\n",

To be of use, cross-impact models must fit\ndata and be well-behaved so they can be applied in applications such as optimal\ntrading. To address these issues, we introduce a set of desirable properties\nwhich constrain cross-impact models.

In this study,\nwe used agent-based simulations to compare the major liquidity indicators in an\nartificial market where an HFT participated was compared to one where no HFT\nparticipated. The results showed that all liquidity indicators in the market\nwhere an HFT participated improved more than those in the market where no HFT\nparticipated. Furthermore, as a result of investigating the correlations\nbetween the major liquidity indicators in our simulations and the extant\nempirical literature, we found that market liquidity can be measured not only\nby the major liquidity indicators but also by execution rate. Therefore, it is\nsuggested that it could be appropriate to employ execution rate as a novel\nliquidity indicator in future studies.\n",

However, to train a practical DRL trading agent that decides where\nto trade, at what price, and what quantity involves error-prone and arduous\ndevelopment and debugging. In this paper, we introduce a DRL library FinRL that\nfacilitates beginners to expose themselves to quantitative finance and to\ndevelop their own stock trading strategies. Along with easily-reproducible\ntutorials, FinRL library allows users to streamline their own developments and\nto compare with existing schemes easily. Within FinRL, virtual environments are\nconfigured with stock market datasets, trading agents are trained with neural\nnetworks, and extensive backtesting is analyzed via trading performance.\nMoreover, it incorporates important trading constraints such as transaction\ncost, market liquidity and the investor's degree of risk-aversion. FinRL is\nfeatured with completeness, hands-on tutorial and reproducibility that favors\nbeginners: (i) at multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simulates trading\nenvironments across various stock markets, including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, S&P 500,\nHSI, SSE 50, and CSI 300; (ii) organized in a layered architecture with modular\nstructure, FinRL provides fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms (DQN,\nDDPG, PPO, SAC, A2C, TD3, etc.), commonly-used reward functions and standard\nevaluation baselines to alleviate the debugging workloads and promote the\nreproducibility, and (iii) being highly extendable, FinRL reserves a complete\nset of user-import interfaces. Furthermore, we incorporated three application\ndemonstrations, namely single stock trading, multiple stock trading, and\nportfolio allocation. The FinRL library will be available on Github at link\nhttps://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library.\n",

The\nhigh volatility of Bitcoin and the complex factors affecting them make the\nstudy of effective price forecasting methods of great practical importance to\nfinancial investors and researchers worldwide. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach called MRC-LSTM, which combines a Multi-scale Residual\nConvolutional neural network (MRC) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to\nimplement Bitcoin closing price prediction. Specifically, the Multi-scale\nresidual module is based on one-dimensional convolution, which is not only\ncapable of adaptive detecting features of different time scales in multivariate\ntime series, but also enables the fusion of these features. LSTM has the\nability to learn long-term dependencies in series, which is widely used in\nfinancial time series forecasting. By mixing these two methods, the model is\nable to obtain highly expressive features and efficiently learn trends and\ninteractions of multivariate time series. In the study, the impact of external\nfactors such as macroeconomic variables and investor attention on the Bitcoin\nprice is considered in addition to the trading information of the Bitcoin\nmarket. We performed experiments to predict the daily closing price of Bitcoin\n(USD), and the experimental results show that MRC-LSTM significantly\noutperforms a variety of other network structures. Furthermore, we conduct\nadditional experiments on two other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Litecoin, to\nfurther confirm the effectiveness of the MRC-LSTM in short-term forecasting for\nmultivariate time series of cryptocurrencies.\n",

We identify trading platform\ntechnical issues of one of the world's leading online trading providers and\ncalculate retail traders losses caused by these issues. To do this, we\nindependently record each trade details using the REST API response provided by\nthe broker. We show traders log activity files is the only way to assess any\nsuspected profit or loss manipulation by the broker. Therefore, it is essential\nfor any retail trader to have access to their log files. We compare our\nfindings with broker's Trustpilot customer reviews. We illustrate how traders'\nprofit and loss can be negatively affected by broker's platform technical\nissues such as not being able to close profitable trades, closing trades with\ndelays, disappearance of trades, disappearance of profit from clients\nstatements, profit and loss discrepancies, stop loss not being triggered, stop\nloss or limit order triggered too early. Although regulatory bodies try to\nensure that consumers get a fair deal, these attempts are hugely insufficient\nin protecting retail traders.

To do this, we develop a flexible agent-based discrete-event\nmarket simulation in which agents operating under our strategies can play\nFiggie. Our simulation builds upon previous work by simulating latencies\nbetween agents and the market in a novel and efficient way. The fundamentalist\nstrategy we develop takes advantage of Figgie's unique notion of asset value,\nand is, on average, the profit-maximizing strategy in all combinations of agent\nstrategies tested. We develop a strategy, the \"bottom-feeder\", which estimates\nvalue by observing orders sent by other agents, and find that it limits the\nsuccess of fundamentalists. We also find that chartist strategies implemented,\nincluding one from the literature, fail by going into feedback loops in the\nsmall Figgie market. We further develop a bootstrap method for statistically\ncomparing strategies in a zero-sum game. Our results demonstrate the\nwide-ranging applicability of agent-based discrete-event simulations in\nstudying markets.\n",

The trader encounters a trade-off between the\ntransaction costs incurred due to market impact and the volatility risk of\nholding the position. Our formulation begins with a continuous-time and\ninfinite horizon variation of the seminal model of Almgren and Chriss (2000),\nbut we define as the objective the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of the\nimplementation shortfall, and allow for dynamic (adaptive) trading strategies.\nIn this setting, we are able to derive closed-form expressions for the optimal\nliquidation strategy and its value function.\n  Our results yield a number of important practical insights. We are able to\nquantify the benefit of adaptive policies over optimized static policies. The\nrelevant improvement depends only on the level of risk aversion: for moderate\nlevels of risk aversion, the optimal dynamic policy outperforms the optimal\nstatic policy by 5-15%, and outperforms the optimal volume weighted average\nprice (VWAP) policy by 15-25%. This improvement is achieved through dynamic\npolicies that exhibit \"aggressiveness-in-the-money\": trading is accelerated\nwhen price movements are favorable, and is slowed when price movements are\nunfavorable.\n  From a mathematical perspective, our analysis exploits the dual\nrepresentation of CVaR to convert the problem to a continuous-time, zero-sum\ngame. We leverage the idea of the state-space augmentation, and obtain a\npartial differential equation describing the optimal value function, which is\nseparable and a special instance of the Emden-Fowler equation. This leads to a\nclosed-form solution. As our problem is a special case of a\nlinear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem with a CVaR objective, these results\nmay be interesting in broader settings.\n",

Studies have found that reinforcement learning (RL) can\nhelp decide the order-splitting sizes. However, a problem remains unsolved: how\nto place limit orders at appropriate limit prices? The key challenge lies in\nthe \"continuous-discrete duality\" of the action space. On the one hand, the\ncontinuous action space using percentage changes in prices is preferred for\ngeneralization. On the other hand, the trader eventually needs to choose limit\nprices discretely due to the existence of the tick size, which requires\nspecialization for every single stock with different characteristics (e.g., the\nliquidity and the price range). So we need continuous control for\ngeneralization and discrete control for specialization. To this end, we propose\na hybrid RL method to combine the advantages of both of them. We first use a\ncontinuous control agent to scope an action subset, then deploy a fine-grained\nagent to choose a specific limit price.

However, this kind\nof practice omits the specific characteristics of individual stocks by applying\nthe same set of parameters for different stocks. On the other hand, learning\ndifferent models for each stock would face data sparsity or cold start problems\nfor many stocks with small capitalization. To take advantage of the data scale\nand the various characteristics of individual stocks, we propose a dual-process\nmeta-learning method that treats the prediction of each stock as one task under\nthe meta-learning framework. Our method can model the common pattern behind\ndifferent stocks with a meta-learner, while modeling the specific pattern for\neach stock across time spans with stock-dependent parameters. Furthermore, we\npropose to mine the pattern of each stock in the form of a latent variable\nwhich is then used for learning the parameters for the prediction module. This\nmakes the prediction procedure aware of the data pattern. Extensive experiments\non volume predictions show that our method can improve the performance of\nvarious baseline models.

In\norder to reduce the impact on prices due to the execution of large orders,\ntraders in financial markets split large orders into a series of smaller ones,\nwhich are executed sequentially. The resulting sequence of trades is called a\nmeta-order. Empirical studies have revealed a non-trivial set of statistical\nlaws on how meta-orders affect prices, which include i) the square-root\nbehaviour of the expected price variation with the total volume traded, ii) its\ncrossover to a linear regime for small volumes, and iii) a reversion of average\nprices towards its initial value, after the sequence of trades is over.

The simplicity of this\nderivation lends further support to the robustness and universality of market\nimpact laws.

        "summary": "  We present a new discrete time version of Kyle's (1985) classic model of\ninsider trading, formulated as a generalised extensive form game. The model has\nthree kinds of traders: an insider, random noise traders, and a market maker.\nThe insider aims to exploit her informational advantage and maximise expected\nprofits while the market maker observes the total order flow and sets prices\naccordingly.\n  First, we show how the multi-period model with finitely many pure strategies\ncan be reduced to a (static) social system in the sense of Debreu (1952) and\nprove the existence of a sequential Kyle equilibrium, following Kreps and\nWilson (1982). This works for any probability distribution with finite support\nof the noise trader's demand and the true value, and for any finite information\nflow of the insider. In contrast to Kyle (1985) with normal distributions,\nequilibria exist in general only in mixed strategies and not in pure\nstrategies.\n  In the single-period model we establish bounds for the insider's strategy in\nequilibrium. Finally, we prove the existence of an equilibrium for the game\nwith a continuum of actions, by considering an approximating sequence of games\nwith finitely many actions. Because of the lack of compactness of the set of\nmeasurable price functions, standard infinite-dimensional fixed point theorems\nare not applicable.\n",

AMMs are typically implemented as smart contracts on\nblockchains, and its prices are kept in line with the overall market price by\narbitrage: if the AMM undervalues an asset with respect to the market, an\n\"arbitrageur\" can make a risk-free profit by buying just enough of that asset\nto bring the AMM's price back in line with the market.\n  AMMs, however, are not designed for assets that expire: that is, assets that\ncannot be produced or resold after a specified date. As assets approach\nexpiration, arbitrage may not be able to reconcile supply and demand, and the\nliquidity providers that funded the AMM may have excessive exposure to risk due\nto rapid price variations.\n  This paper formally describes the design of a decentralized exchange (DEX)\nfor assets that expire, combining aspects of AMMs and limit-order books.

To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces Stockformer, a price-volume factor stock selection model\nthat integrates wavelet transformation and a multitask self-attention network,\naimed at enhancing responsiveness and predictive accuracy regarding market\ninstabilities. Through discrete wavelet transform, Stockformer decomposes stock\nreturns into high and low frequencies, meticulously capturing long-term market\ntrends and short-term fluctuations, including abrupt events. Moreover, the\nmodel incorporates a Dual-Frequency Spatiotemporal Encoder and graph embedding\ntechniques to effectively capture complex temporal and spatial relationships\namong stocks. Employing a multitask learning strategy, it simultaneously\npredicts stock returns and directional trends. Experimental results show that\nStockformer outperforms existing advanced methods on multiple real stock market\ndatasets. In strategy backtesting, Stockformer consistently demonstrates\nexceptional stability and reliability across market conditions-whether rising,\nfalling, or fluctuating-particularly maintaining high performance during\ndownturns or volatile periods, indicating a high adaptability to market\nfluctuations. To foster innovation and collaboration in the financial analysis\nsector, the Stockformer model's code has been open-sourced and is available on\nthe GitHub repository: https://github.com/Eric991005/Multitask-Stockformer.\n",

Once such a (linear) model is identified, a separate\nmean reversion strategy is then devised to generate a trading signal. With a\nview of generalising such an approach and turning it truly data-driven, we\nstudy the utility of Autoencoder architectures in StatArb. As a first approach,\nwe employ a standard Autoencoder trained on US stock returns to derive trading\nstrategies based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. To further enhance\nthis model, we take a policy-learning approach and embed the Autoencoder\nnetwork into a neural network representation of a space of portfolio trading\npolicies. This integration outputs portfolio allocations directly and is\nend-to-end trainable by backpropagation of the risk-adjusted returns of the\nneural policy. Our findings demonstrate that this innovative end-to-end policy\nlearning approach not only simplifies the strategy development process, but\nalso yields superior gross returns over its competitors illustrating the\npotential of end-to-end training over classical two-stage approaches.\n",

Key findings include a significant increase in\noverall transactions of counterfeit tokens on their first day of fraud, and a\nrise in upfront fraud costs leading to corresponding increases in revenue.\nFurthermore, a negative correlation is identified between the total revenue of\ncounterfeit tokens and the volatility of Ethereum market capitalization return,\nwhile price return volatility on Ethereum is found to have a positive impact on\ncounterfeit token revenue, albeit requiring further investigation for a\ncomprehensive understanding. Additionally, the number of subscribers for the\nreal token correlates positively with the realized volume of scam tokens,\nindicating that a larger community following the legitimate token may\ninadvertently contribute to the visibility and success of counterfeit tokens.\nConversely, the number of Telegram subscribers exhibits a negative impact on\nthe realized volume of scam tokens, suggesting that a higher level of scrutiny\nor awareness within Telegram communities may act as a deterrent to fraudulent\nactivities.

In a periodic auction, we discover that a strategic\ntrader could take advantage of the accumulated information available along the\nauction duration by arriving at the latest moment before the auction closes,\nincreasing the price impact on the market.

        "summary": "  The steel industry is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, accounting for 7%\nof global emissions. The European steel industry is seeking to reduce its\nemissions by increasing the use of electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which can\nproduce steel from scrap, marking a major shift towards a circular steel\neconomy. Here, we show by combining trade with business intelligence data that\nthis shift requires a deep restructuring of the global and European scrap\ntrade, as well as a substantial scaling of the underlying business ecosystem.\nWe find that the scrap imports of European countries with major EAF\ninstallations have steadily decreased since 2007 while globally scrap trade\nstarted to increase recently. Our statistical modelling shows that every 1,000\ntonnes of EAF capacity installed is associated with an increase in annual\nimports of 550 tonnes and a decrease in annual exports of 1,000 tonnes of\nscrap, suggesting increased competition for scrap metal as countries ramp up\ntheir EAF capacity. Furthermore, each scrap company enables an increase of\naround 79,000 tonnes of EAF-based steel production per year in the EU. Taking\nthese relations as causal and extrapolating to the currently planned EAF\ncapacity, we find that an additional 730 (SD 140) companies might be required,\nemploying about 35,000 people (IQR 29,000-50,000) and generating an additional\nestimated turnover of USD 35 billion (IQR 27-48). Our results thus suggest that\nscrap metal is likely to become a strategic resource. They highlight the need\nfor a massive restructuring of the industry's supply networks and identify the\nresulting growth opportunities for companies.\n",

Agent lenders within\nthe market seek to optimize revenue by lending out securities at the highest\nrate possible.

These approaches are often\ndifficult to scale and are not adaptive to changing market conditions. Unlike a\ntraditional stock exchange with a centralized limit order book, the securities\nlending market is organized similarly to an e-commerce marketplace, where agent\nlenders and borrowers can transact at any agreed price in a bilateral fashion.\nThis similarity suggests that the use of typical methods for addressing dynamic\npricing problems in e-commerce could be effective in the securities lending\nmarket. We show that existing contextual bandit frameworks can be successfully\nutilized in the securities lending market. Using offline evaluation on real\nhistorical data, we show that the contextual bandit approach can consistently\noutperform typical approaches by at least 15% in terms of total revenue\ngenerated.\n",

In\nthis paper we study how investors facing many different games, gather\ninformation and form their decision despite being unaware of the complete\nstructure of the game. To this end we apply reinforcement learning methods to\nthe Information Theory Model of Markets (ITMM). Following Mengel, we can try to\ndistinguish a class $\\Gamma$ of games and possible actions (strategies)\n$a^{i}_{m_{i}}$ for $i-$th agent. Any agent divides the whole class of games\ninto analogy subclasses she/he thinks are analogous and therefore adopts the\nsame strategy for a given subclass. The criteria for partitioning are based on\nprofit and costs analysis. The analogy classes and strategies are updated at\nvarious stages through the process of learning.

The informed trader uses the extraneous\ninformation source to seek statistical arbitrage opportunities, while at the\nsame time accommodating the additional risk. The amount of information\navailable to the general market participant concerning the asset return is\nmeasured by the mutual information of the asset price and the associated cash\nflow. The worth of the additional information source is then measured in terms\nof the difference of mutual information between the general market participant\nand the informed trader. This difference is shown to be nonnegative when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the information flow is known in advance.

We focus on four essential ingredients: fundamentalist agents which\ntend to stabilize the market; chartist agents which induce destabilization;\nanalysis of price behavior for the two strategies; herding behavior which\ngoverns the possibility of changing strategy. Bubbles and crashes correspond to\nsituations dominated by chartists, while fundamentalists provide a long time\nstability (on average).

Therefore they correspond to finite size effect which, however, can\noccur at different time scales.

The aim of the\nmodel is to consider the minimal elements for the understanding of the origin\nof the Stylized Facts and their Self-Organization. The key elements are\nfundamentalist agents, chartist agents, herding dynamics and price behavior.\nThe first two elements correspond to the competition between stability and\ninstability tendencies in the market. The herding behavior governs the\npossibility of the agents to change strategy and it is a crucial element of\nthis class of models. The linear approximation permits a simple interpretation\nof the model dynamics and, for many properties, it is possible to derive\nanalytical results. The generalized non linear dynamics results to be extremely\nmore sensible to the parameter space and much more difficult to analyze and\ncontrol. The main results for the nature and Self-Organization of the Stylized\nFacts are, however, very similar in the two cases. The main peculiarity of the\nnon linear dynamics is an enhancement of the fluctuations and a more marked\nevidence of the Stylized Facts.

An investor needs to execute a long\nposition in the asset affecting the price of the asset and possibly incurring\nin fixed transaction cost. The objective is to maximize the discounted revenue\nobtained by this transaction. This problem is formulated first as an impulse\ncontrol problem and we characterize the value function using the viscosity\nsolutions framework. We also analyze the case where there is no transaction\ncost and how this formulation relates with a singular control problem. A\nviscosity solution characterization is provided in this case as well. We also\nestablish a connection between both formulations with zero fixed transaction\ncost. Numerical examples with different types of price impact conclude the\ndiscussion.\n",

Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust each other for\na certain amount of each other's currency. This allows the network to serve as\na decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed\nthrough the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective\ncurrencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly\ntransact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A\nnatural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain\nliquidity, i.e., how long can the network support the routing of payments\nbefore credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term\nfailure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit\nvalues.\n  We prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path\nalong which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction\nrates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph\nfamilies goes to zero as the size, density or credit capacity of the network\nincreases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and\ncredit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are\nwell-connected. Further, we characterize a centralized currency system as a\nspecial type of a star network (one where edges to the root have infinite\ncredit capacity, and transactions occur only between leaf nodes) and compute\nthe steady-state transaction failure probability in a centralized system. We\nshow that liquidity in star networks, complete graphs and Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\nnetworks is comparable to that in equivalent centralized currency systems; thus\nwe do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized\nproperties.\n",

Each of our agents begins with\nbeliefs about how his own trades impact prices and how prices would move in his\nabsence. They, along with other market participants, then submit orders which\nare executed at a common venue.

The key novelty is that we propose to employ\nadversarial training to improve the generalization of a neural network\nprediction model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the\ninput features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is\nessentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature.\nAs such, normal training with static price-based features (e.g. the close\nprice) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable\nmodels. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate\nthe stochasticity of price variable, and train the model to work well under\nsmall yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two real-world\nstock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solution with\n3.11% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, validating the\nusefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task.\n",

In this paper, we build a multi-agent simulation of a\ndealer market and demonstrate that it can be used to understand the behavior of\na reinforcement learning (RL) based market maker agent. We use the simulator to\ntrain an RL-based market maker agent with different competitive scenarios,\nreward formulations and market price trends (drifts). We show that the\nreinforcement learning agent is able to learn about its competitor's pricing\npolicy; it also learns to manage inventory by smartly selecting asymmetric\nprices on the buy and sell sides (skewing), and maintaining a positive (or\nnegative) inventory depending on whether the market price drift is positive (or\nnegative). Finally, we propose and test reward formulations for creating risk\naverse RL-based market maker agents.\n",

A key component for the successful renewable\nenergy sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we\npropose a novel modelling framework for the strategic participation of energy\nstorage in the European continuous intraday market where exchanges occur\nthrough a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is\nthe maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while\ntaking into account the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential\ndecision-making problem of trading in the intraday market is modelled as a\nMarkov Decision Process. An asynchronous distributed version of the fitted Q\niteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample\nefficiency. The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order\nbook motivates the use of high-level actions and an alternative state\nrepresentation. Historical data are used for the generation of a large number\nof artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the\nlearning process.

In order to forecast\nstock prices, we used a long short-term memory (LSTM) model in which we\ninputted the prices of two other stocks that lie in rather close correlation\nwith GS. Other models such as ARIMA were used as benchmark. Empirical results\nmanifest the practical challenges when using LSTM for forecasting stocks. One\nof the main upheavals was a recurring lag which we called \"forecasting lag\".\n  The second purpose is to develop a more general and objective perspective on\nthe task of time series forecasting so that it could be applied to assist in an\narbitrary that of forecasting by ANNs. Thus, attempts are made for\ndistinguishing previous works by certain criteria (introduced by a review paper\nwritten by Ahmed Tealab) so as to summarise those including effective\ninformation. The summarised information is then unified and expressed through a\ncommon terminology that can be applied to different steps of a time series\nforecasting task.\n  The last but not least purpose of this thesis is to elaborate on a\nmathematical framework on which ANNs are based. We are going to use the\nframework introduced in the book \"Neural Networks in Mathematical Framework\" by\nAnthony L. Caterini in which the structure of a generic neural network is\nintroduced and the gradient descent algorithm (which incorporates\nbackpropagation) is introduced in terms of their described framework. In the\nend, we use this framework for a specific architecture, which is recurrent\nneural networks on which we concentrated and our implementations are based.

Stock market traders utilize machine learning\nmodels to predict the market's behavior and execute an investment strategy\naccordingly.

Despite this risk, the\ntrading domain remains largely unexplored in the context of adversarial\nlearning. In this study, we present a realistic scenario in which an attacker\ninfluences algorithmic trading systems by using adversarial learning techniques\nto manipulate the input data stream in real time. The attacker creates a\nuniversal perturbation that is agnostic to the target model and time of use,\nwhich, when added to the input stream, remains imperceptible. We evaluate our\nattack on a real-world market data stream and target three different trading\nalgorithms. We show that when added to the input stream, our perturbation can\nfool the trading algorithms at future unseen data points, in both white-box and\nblack-box settings. Finally, we present various mitigation methods and discuss\ntheir limitations, which stem from the algorithmic trading domain. We believe\nthat these findings should serve as an alert to the finance community about the\nthreats in this area and promote further research on the risks associated with\nusing automated learning models in the trading domain.\n",

In the present note we argue that it is possible to have a total\nendogeneity ratio greater than unity without rendering the process unstable. In\nparticular, we show that, provided the endogeneity ratio of the linear Hawkes\ncomponent is smaller than unity, Quadratic Hawkes processes are always\nstationary, although with infinite mean intensity when the total endogenity\nratio exceeds one. This results from a subtle compensation between the\ninhibiting realisations (mean-reversion) and their exciting counterparts\n(trends).\n",

Especially, intraday trading is one of the most profitable\nand risky tasks because of the intraday behaviors of the financial market that\nreflect billions of rapidly fluctuating capitals. However, a vast majority of\nexisting RL methods focus on the relatively low frequency trading scenarios\n(e.g., day-level) and fail to capture the fleeting intraday investment\nopportunities due to two major challenges: 1) how to effectively train\nprofitable RL agents for intraday investment decision-making, which involves\nhigh-dimensional fine-grained action space; 2) how to learn meaningful\nmulti-modality market representation to understand the intraday behaviors of\nthe financial market at tick-level. Motivated by the efficient workflow of\nprofessional human intraday traders, we propose DeepScalper, a deep\nreinforcement learning framework for intraday trading to tackle the above\nchallenges. Specifically, DeepScalper includes four components: 1) a dueling\nQ-network with action branching to deal with the large action space of intraday\ntrading for efficient RL optimization; 2) a novel reward function with a\nhindsight bonus to encourage RL agents making trading decisions with a\nlong-term horizon of the entire trading day; 3) an encoder-decoder architecture\nto learn multi-modality temporal market embedding, which incorporates both\nmacro-level and micro-level market information; 4) a risk-aware auxiliary task\nto maintain a striking balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world market data spanning over three\nyears on six financial futures, we demonstrate that DeepScalper significantly\noutperforms many state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four financial\ncriteria.\n",

The main challenges in this domain are to find a way for\nmodeling the existing relations among an arbitrary set of stocks and to exploit\nsuch a model for improving the prediction performance for those stocks. The\nmost of existing methods in this domain rely on basic graph-analysis\ntechniques, with limited prediction power, and suffer from a lack of generality\nand flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called GCNET\nthat models the relations among an arbitrary set of stocks as a graph structure\ncalled influence network and uses a set of history-based prediction models to\ninfer plausible initial labels for a subset of the stock nodes in the graph.\nFinally, GCNET uses the Graph Convolutional Network algorithm to analyze this\npartially labeled graph and predicts the next price direction of movement for\neach stock in the graph. GCNET is a general prediction framework that can be\napplied for the prediction of the price fluctuations of interacting stocks\nbased on their historical data.

The\ndealer model is a microscopic financial model where individual traders make\ndecisions on limit-order prices stochastically and then reach agreements on\ntransactions. In the literature, this model was solved for several cases: an\nexact solution for two-body traders $N=2$ and a mean-field solution for many\ntraders $N\\gg 1$. Remarkably, while kinetic theory plays a significant role in\nthe mean-field analysis for $N\\gg 1$, its role is still elusive for the case of\n$N=2$. In this paper, we revisit the two-body dealer model $N=2$ to clarify the\nutility of the kinetic theory. We first derive the exact master-Liouville\nequations for the two-body dealer model by several methods. We next illustrate\nthe physical picture of the master-Liouville equation from the viewpoint of the\nprobability currents. The master-Liouville equations are then solved exactly to\nderive the order-book profile and the average transaction interval.\nFurthermore, we introduce a generalised two-body dealer model by incorporating\ninteraction between traders via the market midprice and exactly solve the model\nwithin the kinetic framework. We finally confirm our exact solution by\nnumerical simulations. This work provides a systematic mathematical basis for\nthe econophysics model by developing better mathematical intuition.\n",

Ladder strategies place uniform volume across an\ninterval of contiguous prices. Scaled beta distribution based policies\ngeneralise these, allowing volume to be skewed across the price interval. We\ndemonstrate that this flexibility is useful for inventory management, one of\nthe key challenges faced by a market maker.\n  In this paper, we conduct three main experiments: first, we compare our more\nflexible beta-based actions with the special case of ladder strategies; then,\nwe investigate the performance of simple fixed distributions; and finally, we\ndevise and evaluate a simple and intuitive dynamic control policy that adjusts\nactions in a continuous manner depending on the signed inventory that the\nmarket maker has acquired.

Despite\nrecent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown stellar performance on\ncapturing trading opportunities in the stochastic stock market, we observe that\nthe performance of existing DL methods is sensitive to random seeds and network\ninitialization. To design more profitable DL methods, we analyze this\nphenomenon and find two major limitations of existing works. First, there is a\nnoticeable gap between accurate financial predictions and profitable investment\nstrategies. Second, investment decisions are made based on only one individual\npredictor without consideration of model uncertainty, which is inconsistent\nwith the workflow in real-world trading firms. To tackle these two limitations,\nwe first reformulate quantitative investment as a multi-task learning problem.\nLater on, we propose AlphaMix, a novel two-stage mixture-of-experts (MoE)\nframework for quantitative investment to mimic the efficient bottom-up trading\nstrategy design workflow of successful trading firms. In Stage one, multiple\nindependent trading experts are jointly optimized with an individual\nuncertainty-aware loss function. In Stage two, we train neural routers\n(corresponding to the role of a portfolio manager) to dynamically deploy these\nexperts on an as-needed basis. AlphaMix is also a universal framework that is\napplicable to various backbone network architectures with consistent\nperformance gains.

However, it is impractical to set up a trading market between every two\ncurrencies. In order to control management costs and ensure sufficient\nliquidity, we must give priority to covering those large-volume trading pairs\nand ensure that all coins are reachable. We note that this is an optimization\nproblem. Its particularity lies in: 1) the trading volume between most (>99.5%)\npossible trading pairs cannot be directly observed. 2) It satisfies the\nconnectivity constraint, that is, all currencies are guaranteed to be tradable.\n  To solve this problem, we use a two-stage process: 1) Fill in missing values\nbased on a regularized, truncated eigenvalue decomposition, where the\nregularization term is used to control what extent missing values should be\nlimited to zero. 2) Search for the optimal trading pairs, based on a branch and\nbound process, with heuristic search and pruning strategies.\n  The experimental results show that: 1) If the number of denominated coins is\nnot limited, we will get a more decentralized trading pair settings, which\nadvocates the establishment of trading pairs directly between large currency\npairs. 2) There is a certain room for optimization in all exchanges. The\nsetting of inappropriate trading pairs is mainly caused by subjectively setting\nsmall coins to quote, or failing to track emerging big coins in time. 3) Too\nfew trading pairs will lead to low coverage; too many trading pairs will need\nto be adjusted with markets frequently.

Then, we\nrestrict the dataset to a small number of assets with the same volatility\ncoefficient and use such data to train a deep feed-forward neural network that\nforecasts the prices for the next 30 days of open stocks market. Finally, our\ntrading system calculates the most effective technical indicator by applying it\nto the DNNs predictions and uses such indicator to guide its trades.\n  The results confirm that neural networks outperform classical statistical\ntechniques when performing such forecasts, and their predictions allow to\nselect a trading strategy that, when applied to the real future, increases\nExpectancy, Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios with respect to the strategy\nselected through traditional backtesting.\n",

        "summary": "  Pairs trading is a family of trading techniques that determine their policies\nbased on monitoring the relationships between pairs of assets. A common pairs\ntrading approach relies on describing the pair-wise relationship as a linear\nSpace State (SS) model with Gaussian noise. This representation facilitates\nextracting financial indicators with low complexity and latency using a Kalman\nFilter (KF), that are then processed using classic policies such as Bollinger\nBands (BB). However, such SS models are inherently approximated and mismatched,\noften degrading the revenue. In this work, we propose KalmenNet-aided Bollinger\nbands Pairs Trading (KBPT), a deep learning aided policy that augments the\noperation of KF-aided BB trading. KBPT is designed by formulating an extended\nSS model for pairs trading that approximates their relationship as holding\npartial co-integration. This SS model is utilized by a trading policy that\naugments KF-BB trading with a dedicated neural network based on the KalmanNet\narchitecture. The resulting KBPT is trained in a two-stage manner which first\ntunes the tracking algorithm in an unsupervised manner independently of the\ntrading task, followed by its adaptation to track the financial indicators to\nmaximize revenue while approximating BB with a differentiable mapping. KBPT\nthus leverages data to overcome the approximated nature of the SS model,\nconverting the KF-BB policy into a trainable model. We empirically demonstrate\nthat our proposed KBPT systematically yields improved revenue compared with\nmodel-based and data-driven benchmarks over various different assets.\n",

The computation of the trade currency preference is based on the world\ntrade network built from the 2010-2020 UN Comtrade data. The preference of a\ncountry to trade in US dollar or Chinese yuan is determined by two\nmultiplicative factors: the relative weight of trade volume exchanged by the\ncountry with its direct trade partners, and the relative weight of its trade\npartners in the global international trade. The performed analysis, based on\nIsing spin interactions on the world trade network, shows that, from 2010 to\npresent, a transition took place, and the majority of the world countries would\nhave now a preference to trade in Chinese yuan if one only consider the world\ntrade network structure.\n",

Recently,\nreinforcement learning in financial markets (FinRL) has emerged as a promising\ndirection to train agents for making profitable investment decisions. However,\nthe evaluation of most FinRL methods only focuses on profit-related measures\nand ignores many critical axes, which are far from satisfactory for financial\npractitioners to deploy these methods into real-world financial markets.\nTherefore, we introduce PRUDEX-Compass, which has 6 axes, i.e., Profitability,\nRisk-control, Universality, Diversity, rEliability, and eXplainability, with a\ntotal of 17 measures for a systematic evaluation. Specifically, i) we propose\nAlphaMix+ as a strong FinRL baseline, which leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE)\nand risk-sensitive approaches to make diversified risk-aware investment\ndecisions, ii) we evaluate 8 FinRL methods in 4 long-term real-world datasets\nof influential financial markets to demonstrate the usage of our\nPRUDEX-Compass, iii) PRUDEX-Compass together with 4 real-world datasets,\nstandard implementation of 8 FinRL methods and a portfolio management\nenvironment is released as public resources to facilitate the design and\ncomparison of new FinRL methods. We hope that PRUDEX-Compass can not only shed\nlight on future FinRL research to prevent untrustworthy results from stagnating\nFinRL into successful industry deployment but also provide a new challenging\nalgorithm evaluation scenario for the reinforcement learning (RL) community.\n",

As a result,\nwe introduce two novel multi-agent RL (MARL) methods, CPPI-MADDPG and\nTIPP-MADDPG, tailored for probing strategic trading within quantitative\nmarkets. To validate these innovations, we implemented them on a diverse\nselection of 100 real-market shares.

In this model, a\ncountry trade preference for one of the three currencies is determined by a\nmultiplicative factor based on trade flows between countries and their relative\nweights in the global international trade. The three currency seed groups are\nformed by 9 eurozone countries for the euro, 5 Anglo-Saxon countries for the US\ndollar and the 5 BRICS countries for the new proposed currency. The countries\nbelonging to these 3 currency seed groups trade only with their own associated\ncurrency whereas the other countries choose their preferred trade currency as a\nfunction of the trade relations with their commercial partners. The trade\ncurrency preferences of countries are determined on the basis of a Monte Carlo\nmodeling of Ising type interactions in magnetic spin systems commonly used to\nmodel opinion formation in social networks. We adapt here these models to the\nworld trade network analysis. The results obtained from our mathematical\nmodeling of the structure of the global trade network show that as early as\n2012 about 58 percent of countries would have preferred to trade with the BRICS\ncurrency, 23 percent with the euro and 19 percent with the US dollar.

Recently, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has been applied to optimized trade execution to learn smarter\npolicies from market data.

In\nthis paper, we provide an extensive study on the overfitting problem in\noptimized trade execution. First, we model the optimized trade execution as\noffline RL with dynamic context (ORDC), where the context represents market\nvariables that cannot be influenced by the trading policy and are collected in\nan offline manner. Under this framework, we derive the generalization bound and\nfind that the overfitting issue is caused by large context space and limited\ncontext samples in the offline setting. Accordingly, we propose to learn\ncompact representations for context to address the overfitting problem, either\nby leveraging prior knowledge or in an end-to-end manner. To evaluate our\nalgorithms, we also implement a carefully designed simulator based on\nhistorical limit order book (LOB) data to provide a high-fidelity benchmark for\ndifferent algorithms.

Five Machine Learning models are built, including Bidirectional\nLSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU, and a model built using LSTM\nand GRU algorithms. The models are evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error to\ndetermine their predictive accuracy. Additionally, the paper suggests\nincorporating human intelligence by identifying Superforecasters and tracking\ntheir predictions to anticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices\n. The predictions made by these users can further enhance the accuracy of stock\nprice predictions when combined with Machine Learning and Natural Language\nProcessing techniques. Predicting the price of any commodity can be a\nsignificant task but predicting the price of a stock in the stock market deals\nwith much more uncertainty. Recognising the limited knowledge and exposure to\nstocks among certain investors, this paper proposes price prediction models\nusing Machine Learning algorithms. In this work, five Machine learning models\nare built using Bidirectional LSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU\nand the last one is built using LSTM and GRU algorithms. Later these models are\nassessed using MAE scores to find which model is predicting with the highest\naccuracy. In addition to this, this paper also suggests the use of human\nintelligence to closely predict the shift in price patterns in the stock market\nThe main goal is to identify Superforecasters and track their predictions to\nanticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices. By leveraging the\ncombined power of Machine Learning and the Human Intelligence, predictive\naccuracy can be significantly increased.\n",

Our work attempts to solve this problem through\nlarge language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system\ncalled StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading\nbehaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to\nevaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to\nanalyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent\navoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation\nsystems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging\nprior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate\ndifferent LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment\nthat closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading,\nincluding trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research\nexplores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior\nknowledge related to market data.

Like Gode & Sunder's classic ZIC trader,\nPRZI generates quote-prices from a random distribution over some specified\ndomain of allowable quote-prices. Unlike ZIC, which uses a uniform distribution\nto generate prices, the probability distribution in a PRZI trader is\nparameterised in such a way that its probability mass function (PMF) is\ndetermined by a real-valued control variable s in the range [-1.0, +1.0] that\ndetermines the _strategy_ for that trader. When s=0, a PRZI trader is identical\nto ZIC, with a uniform PMF; but when |s|=~1 the PRZI trader's PMF becomes\nmaximally skewed to one extreme or the other of the price-range, thereby making\nits quote-prices more or less urgent, biasing the quote-price distribution\ntoward or away from the trader's limit-price. To explore the co-evolutionary\ndynamics of populations of PRZI traders that dynamically adapt their\nstrategies, I show results from long-term market experiments in which each\ntrader uses a simple stochastic hill-climber algorithm to repeatedly evaluate\nalternative s-values and choose the most profitable at any given time. In these\nexperiments the profitability of any particular s-value may be non-stationary\nbecause the profitability of one trader's strategy at any one time can depend\non the mix of strategies being played by the other traders at that time, which\nare each themselves continuously adapting. Results from these market\nexperiments demonstrate that the population of traders' strategies can exhibit\nrich dynamics, with periods of stability lasting over hundreds of thousands of\ntrader interactions interspersed by occasional periods of change.

An intriguing pattern of activity surge in 15-minute intervals,\nparticularly at full hours, was also noticed, implying the potential role of\nalgorithmic trading.
