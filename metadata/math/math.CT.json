The motivation for this study came\nfrom attempts to generalize the structure of the category of relations to\nhandle what might be called ``probabilistic relations''. The compact closed\nstructure associated with the category of relations does not generalize\ndirectly, instead one obtains nuclear ideals. We introduce the notion of\nnuclear ideal to analyze these classes of morphisms. In compact closed\ncategories, we see that all morphisms are nuclear, and in the category of\nHilbert spaces, the nuclear morphisms are the Hilbert-Schmidt maps.\n  We also introduce two new examples of tensored *-categories, in which\nintegration plays the role of composition. In the first, morphisms are a\nspecial class of distributions, which we call tame distributions. We also\nintroduce a category of probabilistic relations which was the original\nmotivating example.\n  Finally, we extend the recent work of Joyal, Street and Verity on traced\nmonoidal categories to this setting by introducing the notion of a trace ideal.\nFor a given symmetric monoidal category, it is not generally the case that\narbitrary endomorphisms can be assigned a trace. However, we can find ideals in\nthe category on which a trace can be defined satisfying equations analogous to\nthose of Joyal, Street and Verity. We establish a close correspondence between\nnuclear ideals and trace ideals in a tensored *-category, suggested by the\ncorrespondence between Hilbert-Schmidt operators and trace operators on a\nHilbert space.\n",

The one-sided cases and higher\ndimensions are considered.\n  Chapter Four relates rewrite systems, Groebner bases and automata. Automata\nwhich only accept irreducibles, and automata which output reduced forms are\ndiscussed for presentations of Kan extensions. Reduction machines for rewrite\nsystems are identified with standard output automata and the reduction machines\ndevised for algebras are expressed as Petri nets.\n  Chapter Five uses the completion of a group rewriting system to\nalgorithmically determine a contracting homotopy necessary in order to compute\nthe set of generators for the module of identities among relations using the\ncovering groupoid methods devised by Brown and Razak Salleh. Reducing the\nresulting set of submodule generators is identified as a Groebner basis\nproblem. Algorithms are implemented in GAP3.\n",

Our exposition focusses on the question when two\nsubcategories A and B induce the same regular closure operators, then\ninformation about (non)-cowellpoweredness of A may be gained from corresponding\nproperty of B, and vice versa.\n",

In the unpointed theories, these topoi classify,\nrespectively: 1. connected discrete groupoids, 2. connected (may be pointless)\nprodiscrete localic groupoids, and 3. connected groupoids with discrete space\nof objects and general localic spaces of hom-sets, when the topos has points\n(we do not know the class of localic groupoids that correspond to pointless\nconnected atomic topoi).\n  We comment and develop on Grothendieck's galois theory and its generalization\nby Joyal-Tierney, and work by other authors on these theories.\n",

A number of precise definitions of this notion have\nalready been explored, but a full treatment of their relationships is difficult\nto extract from the literature. Here we describe the relation between two of\nthe most important versions of this notion, which we call `weak' and `coherent'\n2-groups. A weak 2-group is a weak monoidal category in which every morphism\nhas an inverse and every object x has a `weak inverse': an object y such that x\ntensor y and y tensor x are isomorphic to 1. A coherent 2-group is a weak\n2-group in which every object x is equipped with a specified weak inverse x*\nand isomorphisms i_x: 1 -> x tensor x*, e_x: x* tensor x -> 1 forming an\nadjunction. We define 2-categories of weak and coherent 2-groups and construct\nan `improvement' 2-functor which turns weak 2-groups into coherent ones; using\nthis one can show that these 2-categories are biequivalent. We also internalize\nthe concept of a coherent 2-group. This gives a way of defining topological\n2-groups, Lie 2-groups, and the like.\n",

We make these\nconstructions into a functor on a category of chain complexes with additional\nstructure, which we call augmented directed complexes. This functor from\naugmented directed complexes to omega-categories has a left adjoint, and the\nadjunction restricts to an equivalence on a category of augmented directed\ncomplexes with good bases. The omega-categories equivalent to augmented\ndirected complexes with good bases include the omega-categories associated to\nglobes, simplexes and cubes; thus the morphisms between these omega-categories\nare determined by morphisms between chain complexes. It follows that the entire\ntheory of omega-categories can be expressed in terms of chain complexes; in\nparticular we describe the biclosed monoidal structure on omega-categories and\ncalculate some internal homomorphism objects.\n",

The first part of\nthis exposition is aimed at a broad mathematical readership and contains also a\nbrief introduction to simplicial viewpoints on higher categories in general. It\nis explained how the definition of fair $n$-category is almost forced upon us\nby three standard ideas.\n  The second part states some basic results about fair categories, and give\nexamples. The category of fair 2-categories is shown to be equivalent to the\ncategory of bicategories with strict composition law. Fair 3-categories\ncorrespond to tricategories with strict composition laws.

Next, it is shown that the unit compatibility\ncondition for a (strong) monoidal functor is precisely the condition for the\nfunctor to lift to the categories of units, and it is explained how the notion\nof Saavedra unit naturally leads to the equivalent non-algebraic notion of fair\nmonoidal category, where the contractible multitude of units is considered as a\nwhole instead of choosing one unit. To finish, the lax version of the unit\ncomparison is considered. The paper is self-contained. All arguments are\nelementary, some of them of a certain beauty.\n",

Restriction categories facilitate reasoning\nabout partial maps as they have a purely algebraic formulation.\n  In this paper we consider colimits and limits in restriction categories. As\nthe notion of restriction category is not self-dual, we should not expect\ncolimits and limits in restriction categories to behave in the same manner. The\nnotion of colimit in the restriction context is quite straightforward, but\nlimits are more delicate. The suitable notion of limit turns out to be a kind\nof lax limit, satisfying certain extra properties.\n  Of particular interest is the behaviour of the coproduct both by itself and\nwith respect to partial products. We explore various conditions under which the\ncoproducts are ``extensive'' in the sense that the total category (of the\nrelated partial map category) becomes an extensive category. When partial\nlimits are present, they become ordinary limits in the total category. Thus,\nwhen the coproducts are extensive we obtain as the total category a lextensive\ncategory.

The monads in this picture may be generalized to actions of monoidal\ncategories, and actions of PRO-s in particular. If C is a PRO as well, then in\nspecial cases one gets various distributive laws of a given classical type, for\nexample between a comonad and an endofunctor or between a monad and a comonad.\nThe usual pentagons are in general replaced by multigons, and there are also\n``mixed'' multigons involving two distinct distributive laws. Beck's bijection\nbetween the distributive laws and lifts of one monad to the Eilenberg-Moore\ncategory of another monad is here extended to an isomorphism of 2-categories.\nThe lifts of maps of above mentioned pairs are colax C-equivariant.

Categories naturally form a 2-category\n{\\bfseries Cat} so we take the full sub-2-category of this whose 0-cells are\nthe degenerate categories. Monoids naturally form a category, but we regard\nthis as a discrete 2-category to make the comparison. We show that this\nconstruction does not yield a biequivalence; to get an equivalence we ignore\nthe natural transformations and consider only the {\\it category} of degenerate\ncategories. A similar situation occurs for degenerate bicategories. The\ntricategory of such does not yield an equivalence with monoidal categories; we\nmust consider only the categories of such structures. For doubly degenerate\nbicategories the tricategory of such is not naturally triequivalent to the\ncategory of commutative monoids (regarded as a tricategory). However in this\ncase considering just the categories does not give an equivalence either; to\nget an equivalence we consider the {\\it bicategory} of doubly degenerate\nbicategories.

On the other hand, as is well known since 1980s, the heart of any\n$t$-structure is abelian. We unify these two construction by using the notion\nof a cotorsion pair. To any cotorsion pair in a triangulated category, we can\nnaturally associate an abelian category, which gives back each of the above two\nabelian categories, when the cotorsion pair comes from a cluster tilting\nsubcategory, or is a $t$-structure, respectively.\n",

We present the 'standard' such structures, the\nexponential fibrations of basic fibrations and three areas of applications.\nFirst area is related to the T-categories of A. Burroni. The monoids in the\nBurroni lax monoidal fibrations form the fibration of T-categories. The\nconstruction of the relative Burroni fibrations and free T-categories in this\ncontext, allow us to extend the definition of the set of opetopes given by T.\nLeinster to the category of opetopic sets (internally to any Grothendieck\ntopos, if needed). We also show that fibration of (1-level) multicategories,\nconsidered by Hermida-Makkai-Power, is equivalent to the fibration of\n(finitary, cartesian) polynomial monads. This equivalence is induced by the\nequivalence of lax monoidal fibrations of amalgamated signatures, polynomial\ndiagrams, and polynomial (finitary, endo) functors. Finally, we develop a\nsimilar theory for symmetric signatures, analytic diagrams (a notion introduced\nhere), and (finitary, multivariable) analytic (endo)functors. Among other\nthings we show that the fibrations of symmetric multicategories is equivalent\nto the fibration of analytic monads. We also give a characterization of such a\nfibration of analytic monads. An object of this fibration is a weakly cartesian\nmonad on a slice of Set whose functor parts is a finitary functors weakly\npreserving wide pullbacks.

        "summary": "  In the theory of coalgebras $C$ over a ring $R$, the rational functor relates\nthe category of modules over the algebra $C^*$ (with convolution product) with\nthe category of comodules over $C$. It is based on the pairing of the algebra\n$C^*$ with the coalgebra $C$ provided by the evaluation map $\\ev:C^*\\ot_R C\\to\nR$. We generalise this situation by defining a {\\em pairing} between\nendofunctors $T$ and $G$ on any category $\\A$ as a map, natural in $a,b\\in \\A$,\n$$\\beta_{a,b}:\\A(a, G(b)) \\to \\A(T(a),b),$$ and we call it {\\em rational} if\nthese all are injective. In case $\\bT=(T,m_T,e_T)$ is a monad and\n$\\bG=(G,\\delta_G,\\ve_G)$ is a comonad on $\\A$, additional compatibility\nconditions are imposed on a pairing between $\\bT$ and $\\bG$. If such a pairing\nis given and is rational, and $\\bT$ has a right adjoint monad $\\bT^\\di$, we\nconstruct a {\\em rational functor} as the functor-part of an idempotent comonad\non the $\\bT$-modules $\\A_{\\rT}$ which generalises the crucial properties of the\nrational functor for coalgebras. As a special case we consider pairings on\nmonoidal categories.\n",

Weak notions arise when one drops the uniqueness requirement\nand asks only for existence. The enriched versions of the usual notions involve\ncertain morphisms between hom-objects being invertible; here we introduce\nenriched versions of the weak notions by asking that the morphisms between\nhom-objects belong to a chosen class of \"surjections\". We study in particular\ninjectivity (weak orthogonality) in the enriched context, and illustrate how it\ncan be used to describe homotopy coherent structures.\n",

As shown by Brun, a Tambara functor plays a natural role in\nthe Witt-Burnside construction.\n  It will be a natural question if there exist sufficiently many examples of\nTambara functors, compared to the wide range of Mackey functors. In the first\npart of this article, we give a general construction of a Tambara functor from\nany Mackey functor, on an arbitrary group $G$. In fact, we construct a functor\nfrom the category of semi-Mackey functors to the category of Tambara functors.\nThis functor gives a left adjoint to the forgetful functor, and can be regarded\nas a $G$-bivariant analog of the monoid-ring functor.\n  In the latter part, when $G$ is finite, we invsetigate relations with other\nMackey-functorial constructions ---crossed Burnside ring, Elliott's ring of\n$G$-strings, Jacobson's $F$-Burnside ring--- all these lead to the study of the\nWitt-Burnside construction.\n",

The goal of this paper is\nto develop the theory of pseudogroups motivated by applications to group\ntheory, C*-algebras and aperiodic tilings. Our starting point is an adjunction\nbetween a category of pseudogroups and a category of etale groupoids from which\nwe are able to set up a duality between spatial pseudogroups and sober etale\ngroupoids. As a corollary to this duality, we deduce a non-commutative version\nof Stone duality involving what we call boolean inverse semigroups and boolean\netale groupoids, as well as a generalization of this duality to distributive\ninverse semigroups. Non-commutative Stone duality has important applications in\nthe theory of C*-algebras: it is the basis for the construction of Cuntz and\nCuntz-Krieger algbras and in the case of the Cuntz algebras it can also be used\nto construct the Thompson groups. We then define coverages on inverse\nsemigroups and the resulting presentations of pseudogroups.

In this paper we extend the\ntheory of Fujiwara about morphisms to the many-sorted algebras, by defining the\nconcept of polyderivor between many-sorted signatures, which assigns to basic\nsorts, words and to formal operations, families of derived terms, and under\nwhich the standard signature morphisms, the basic mapping-formulas of Fujiwara,\nand the derivors of Goguen-Thatcher-Wagner are subsumed. Then, by means of the\nhomomorphisms between B\\'enabou algebras, which are the algebraic counterpart\nof the finitary many-sorted algebraic theories of B\\'enabou, we define the\ncomposition of polyderivors from which we get a corresponding category,\nisomorphic to the category of Kleisli for a monad on the standard category of\nmany-sorted signatures. Next, by defining the notion of transformation between\npolyderivors, we endow the category of many-sorted signatures and polyderivors\nwith a structure of 2-category. From this we get a derived 2-category of\nmany-sorted specifications in which we prove the equivalence of the many-sorted\nspecifications of Hall and B\\'enabou, and deduce the equivalence of the\ncategories of Hall and B\\'enabou algebras. Besides, by defining corresponding\ncategories of generalized many-sorted terms, we prove that the realization of\nthese terms in the many-sorted algebras is invariant under polyderivors and\ncompatible with the transformations between polyderivors, and from this we get\nan example, among others, of the new concept of 2-institution, itself an strict\ngeneralization of that of institution by Goguen and Burstall.\n",

A von Neumann\ncategory is a premonoidal category with compatible dagger structure which\nembeds as a double commutant into a suitable premonoidal category of Hilbert\nspaces.\n  The notion was inspired by algebraic quantum field theory. In AQFT, one\nassigns to open regions in Minkowski space a C*-algebra, called the local\nalgebra. The local algebras are patched together to form a global algebra\nassociated to the AQFT. The key relativistic assumption is Einstein Causality,\nwhich says that the algebras associated to spacelike separated regions commute\nin the global algebra. Premonoidal categories provide a natural framework for\nlifting such structure from algebras to categories. Thus von Neumann categories\nserve as a basis for extending the abstract quantum mechanics of Abramsky and\nCoecke to include relativistic effects.\n  In this paper, we focus on the structure of von Neumann categories. After\ngiving the basic definitions and examples, we consider constructions typically\nassociated to von Neumann algebras, and examine their extensions to the\ncategory setting. In particular, we present a crossed product construction for\n*-premonoidal categories.\n",

It is know, due to Ringel, that a Hall algebra is\nisomorphic to a certain quantum group. It is our goal to describe a\ncategorification of Hall algebras as a way of doing so for their related\nquantum groups. To do this, we will take the following steps. First, we\ndescribe a new perspective on the structure theory of Hall algebras. This view\nsolves, in a unique way, the classic problem of the multiplication and\ncomultiplication not being compatible. Our solution is to switch to a different\nunderlying category $\\Vect^K$ of vector spaces graded by a group $K$ called the\nGrothendieck group. We equip this category with a nontrivial braiding which\ndepends on the $K$-grading. With this braiding and a given antipode, we find\nthat the Hall algebra does become a Hopf algebra object in $\\Vect^K$. Second,\nwe will describe a categorification process, call `groupoidification', which\nreplaces vector spaces with groupoids and linear operators with `spans' of\ngroupoids. We will use this process to construct a braided monoidal bicategory\nwhich categorifies $\\Vect^K$ via the groupoidification program. Specifically,\ngraded vector spaces will be replaced with groupoids `over' a fixed groupoid\nrelated to the Grothendieck group $K$. The braiding structure will come from an\ninteresting groupoid $\\EXT(M,N)$ which will behave like the Euler\ncharacteristic for the Grothendieck group $K$. We will finish with a\ndescription of our plan to, in future work, apply the same concept to the\nstructure maps of the Hall algebra, which will eventually give us a Hopf\n2-algebra object in our braided monoidal bicategory.\n",

In the second chapter we recall\ntwo ways of defining weighted colimits in equipments. Most important to us is\ntheir original definition, introduced by Wood, in equipments that are endowed\nwith a closed structure. The second notion, of what we call pointwise weighted\ncolimits, was introduced by Grandis and Par\\'e. It requires no extra structure\nand generalises Street's notion of pointwise left Kan extensions in\n2-categories. The main result of the second chapter gives a condition, on\nclosed equipments, under which these two notions coincide.\n  In the third chapter we consider monads on equipments. The main idea of this\nthesis, given in the fourth chapter, generalises the notions of lax and colax\nmorphisms, of algebras over a 2-monad, to notions of lax and colax\npromorphisms, of algebras over a monad on an equipment. One of these, that of\nright colax promorphisms, is well suited to the construction of weighted\ncolimits. In particular, given a monad T on an equipment K, we will show that\nT-algebras, colax T-morphisms and right colax T-promorphisms form a double\ncategory T-rcProm. Although weaker than equipments, double categories still\nallow definition of weighted colimits, and our main result states that the\nforgetful functor T-rcProm -> K lifts all weighted colimits whenever K is\nclosed, under some mild conditions on T.\n",

Our claim is that the structural (coherence)\nisomorphisms of these categorical models, although generally overlooked, have\ndecidedly non-trivial computational content. The theory of categorical\ncoherence is based around reversible structural operations (canonical\nisomorphisms) that allow for transformations between related, but distinct,\nmathematical structures. A number of coherence theorems are commonly used to\ntreat these transformations as though they are identity maps, from which point\nonwards they play no part in computational models. We simply wish to point out\nthat doing so overlooks some significant computational content.\n  We give a single example (taken from an uncountably infinite set of similar\nexamples, and based on structures used in models of reversible logic and\ncomputation) of a category whose structural isomorphisms manipulate modulo\nclasses of natural numbers. We demonstrate that the coherence properties that\nusually allow us to ignore these structural isomorphisms in fact correspond to\ncountably infinite families of non-trivial identities in modular arithmetic.\nFurther, proving the correctness of these equalities without recourse to the\ntheory of categorical coherence appears to be a hard task.\n",

If adjunctions are so important in\nmathematics, then perhaps they will isolate concepts of some importance in the\nempirical sciences. But the applications of adjunctions have been hampered by\nan overly restrictive formulation that avoids heteromorphisms or hets. By\nreformulating an adjunction using hets, it is split into two parts, a left and\na right semiadjunction (or half-adjunuction). Semiadjunctions (essentially a\nformulation of a universal mapping property using hets) turn out to be the\nappropriate concept for applications in the life sciences. The semiadjunctions\ncharacterize three principal schemes with applications: 1. determination\nthrough a receiving universal (e.g., natural selection, perception, language\nacquisition, recursion, and language understanding); 2. determination through a\nsending universal (e.g., intentional action, DNA mechanism to build amino\nacids, hierarchy of regulatory genes to build organs, stem cells, and language\nproduction), and 3. two-way determination with one universal as both receiving\nand sending (e.g., perception/action and language understanding/production).\n",

The constraints are given a specific orientation and satisfy Mac\nLane's five axioms. Whilst recent applications justify the use of skew-monoidal\nstructure, they do not give an intrinsic justification for the form the\nstructure takes (the orientation of the constraints and the axioms that they\nsatisfy). This paper provides a perspective on skew-monoidal structure which,\namongst other things, makes it quite apparent why this particular choice is a\nnatural one. To do this, we use the Catalan simplicial set C. It turns out to\nbe quite easy to describe: it is the nerve of the monoidal poset (2, v, 0) and\nhas a Catalan number of simplices at each dimension (hence the name). Our\nperspective is that C classifies skew-monoidal structures in the sense that\nsimplicial maps from C into a suitably-defined nerve of Cat are precisely\nskew-monoidal categories. More generally, skew monoidales in a monoidal\nbicategory K are classified by maps from C into the simplicial nerve of K.\n",

Subsequently Davide Maglia in unpublished work investigated exactly what\npart of the structure and properties of a group G are needed to permit the\nconstruction of a braided monoidal category with a tangle algebra and was able\nto distinguish blocked two-torsions from the identity.\n  In this paper we present a simplification of his answer, which turns out to\nbe related to the notion of rack. We show that if G is a rack then there is a\nbraided monoidal category TRel_G generalizing that of the above paper.

Iracks are in particular racks but have in addition\nto the operations abstracting group conjugation also a unary operation\nabstracting group inverse.

It is a contribution to categorical logic,\nin particular to the theory of realizability toposes.\n  While the tools of categorical logic have proven very successful in analyzing\nand organizing proof theoretic realizability interpretations, it was remarked\nby experts (notably Peter Johnstone) that the field of realizability toposes\nitself was not clearly delineated, and lacked a powerful theory analogous to\nthat of Grothendieck toposes.\n  The present work sets out to remedy this situation to a certain extent. We\nargue that realizability toposes are best understood using Grothendieck\nfibrations, and develop a framework of fibrational cocompletions, which allows\nto view certain constructions from realizability in precise analogy to\nconstructions of presheaf and sheaf toposes. Using these techniques, and a\nclass of posetal fibrations that we call uniform preorders, we are able to give\nan extensional characterization of partial combinatory algebras and of the\nrealizability toposes that are constructed from these algebras.\n  Striving to develop the analogy to Grothendieck toposes further, we outline\nhow to apply our techniques on arbitrary base toposes, and give a decomposition\ntheorem for constant objects functors induced by triposes, analogous to the\nknown decompositions of geometric morphisms. Finally, we sketch an approach of\nhow to find a unified framework for Grothendieck toposes and realizability\ntoposes, based on the observation that uniform preorders can be identified with\npreorders internal to a category of sheaves.\n",

        "summary": "  Cartesian differential categories were introduced to provide an abstract\naxiomatization of categories of differentiable functions. The fundamental\nexample is the category whose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose arrows are\nsmooth maps.\n  Tensor differential categories provide the framework for categorical models\nof differential linear logic. The coKleisli category of any tensor differential\ncategory is always a Cartesian differential category. Cartesian differential\ncategories, besides arising in this manner as coKleisli categories, occur in\nmany different and quite independent ways. Thus, it was not obvious how to pass\nfrom Cartesian differential categories back to tensor differential categories.\n  This paper provides natural conditions under which the linear maps of a\nCartesian differential category form a tensor differential category. This is a\nquestion of some practical importance as much of the machinery of modern\ndifferential geometry is based on models which implicitly allow such a passage,\nand thus the results and tools of the area tend to freely assume access to this\nstructure.\n  The purpose of this paper is to make precise the connection between the two\ntypes of differential categories. As a prelude to this, however, it is\nconvenient to have available a general theory which relates the behaviour of\n\"linear\" maps in Cartesian categories to the structure of Seely categories. The\nlatter were developed to provide the categorical semantics for (fragments of)\nlinear logic which use a \"storage\" modality. The general theory of storage,\nwhich underlies the results mentioned above, is developed in the opening\nsections of the paper and is then applied to the case of differential\ncategories.\n",

It has been widely\nobserved that each of these definitions is of one of two types: algebraic\ndefinitions, in which composites and coherence cells are explicitly specified,\nand non-algebraic definitions, in which a coherent choice of composites and\nconstraint cells is merely required to exist. Relatively few comparisons have\nbeen made between definitions, and most of those that have concern the\nrelationship between definitions of just one type. The aim of this thesis is to\nestablish more comparisons, including a comparison between an algebraic\ndefinition and a non-algebraic definition.\n  The thesis is divided into two parts. Part 1 concerns the relationships\nbetween three algebraic definitions of weak n-category: those of Penon and\nBatanin, and Leinster's variant of Batanin's definition. A correspondence\nbetween the structures used to define composition and coherence in the\ndefinitions of Batanin and Leinster has long been suspected; we make this\nprecise for the first time. We use this correspondence to prove several\ncoherence theorems that apply to all three definitions, and to take the first\nsteps towards describing the relationship between the weak n-categories of\nBatanin and Leinster.\n  In Part 2 we take the first step towards a comparison between Penon's\ndefinition of weak n-category and a non-algebraic definition, Simpson's variant\nof Tamsamani's definition, in the form of a nerve construction. As a prototype\nfor this nerve construction, we recall a nerve construction for bicategories\nproposed by Leinster, and prove that the nerve of a bicategory given by this\nconstruction is a Tamsamani--Simpson weak 2-category. We then define our nerve\nfunctor for Penon weak n-categories. We prove that the nerve of a Penon weak\n2-category is a Tamsamani--Simpson weak 2-category, and conjecture that this\nresult holds for higher n.\n",

For a small quantaloid Q and a\ndistributor between Q-categories, two adjunctions between the Q-categories of\ncontravariant and covariant presheaves are presented. These adjunctions\nrespectively extend the fundamental construction of Isbell adjunctions and Kan\nextensions in category theory, so, they will be called the Isbell adjunction\nand Kan adjunction, respectively. The functoriality of these constructions is\nthe central topic of this dissertation. In order to achieve this, infomorphisms\nbetween distributors are introduced to organize distributors (as objects) into\na category. Then we proceed as follows: first, the Isbell adjunction and Kan\nadjunction associated with each distributor between Q-categories give rise to\ntwo monads, which are respectively (covariant) functorial and contravariant\nfunctorial from the category of distributors and infomorphisms to the category\nof Q-closure spaces; second, it is shown that the assignments of a distributor\nto the fixed points of the two monads are respectively (covariant) functorial\nand contravariant functorial from the category of distributors and\ninfomorphisms to that of skeletal complete Q-categories and left adjoint\nfunctors. As consequences of the functoriality of the above processes, three\nfactorizations of the free cocompletion functor of Q-categories are presented.\nFinally, as applications, the theory of formal concept analysis and that of\nrough sets are extended to theories based on fuzzy relations between fuzzy\nsets.\n",

As preliminaries, we study Grothendieck\nconditions AB3-AB5 for $\\mathcal{H}$ in a very general setting. We then\nconcentrate on two familiar examples of smashing t-structures. First, we\nconsider that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{G})$ is the (unbounded) derived\ncategory of a Grothendieck category $\\mathcal{G}$ and that the t-structure is\nthe one associated to a torsion pair $\\mathbf{t}=(\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{F})$ in\n$\\mathcal{G}$, usually known as Happel-Reiten-Smal$\\emptyset$ t-structure. In\nthe second example studied, we assume that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{D}(R)$ is the\nderived category of a commutative Noetherian ring $R$ and that the t-structure\nis compactly generated. On what concern the Happel-Reiten-Smal$\\emptyset$\nexample, we show that if $\\mathcal{H}=\\mathcal{H}_\\mathbf{t}$ is AB5, then\n$\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under taking direct limits in $\\mathcal{G}$. Moreover,\nthe converse is true, even implying that $\\mathcal{H}_\\mathbf{t}$ is a\nGrothendieck category, for a wide class of torsion pairs in $\\mathcal{G}$ which\nincludes the hereditary, tilting and cotilting ones. When\n$\\mathcal{G}=R-\\text{Mod}$ is a module category, we are able to identify the\nhereditary torsion pairs $\\mathbf{t}$ in $R-\\text{Mod}$ for which\n$\\mathcal{H}_\\mathbf{t}$ is a module category. When $R$ is a commutative\nnoetherian ring, we show that all compactly generated t-structures in\n$\\mathcal{D}(R)$ whose associated filtration by supports is left bounded have a\nheart $\\mathcal{H}$ which is a Grothendieck category.

This is induced by the existence of the universal\nmeasuring comonoid, a notion originally defined by Sweedler in vector spaces.\nWe then consider the fibred category of modules over arbitrary monoids, and we\nestablish its enrichment in the opfibred category of comodules over arbitrary\ncomonoids. This is now exhibited via the existence of the universal measuring\ncomodule, introduced by Batchelor.\n  We then generalize these results to their `many-object' version. In the\nsetting of the bicategory of V-enriched matrices, we investigate an enrichment\nof V-categories in V-cocategories as well as of V-modules in V-comodules. This\npart constitutes the core of this treatment, and the theory of fibrations and\nadjunctions between them plays a central role in the development. The newly\nconstructed categories are described in detail, and they appropriately fit in a\npicture of duality, enrichment and fibrations as in the previous case.\n  Finally, we introduce the concept of an enriched fibration, aimed to provide\na formal description for the above examples. Related work in this direction,\nthough from a different perspective and with dissimilar outcomes, has been\nrealized by Shulman. We also discuss an abstraction of this picture in the\nenvironment of double categories, concerning categories of monoids and modules\ntherein.\n",

Tarski inverse monoids are therefore the algebraic counterparts of\nthe \\'etale groupoids studied by Matui and provide a natural setting for many\nof his calculations. Under this duality, we prove that natural properties of\nthe \\'etale groupoid correspond to natural algebraic properties of the Tarski\ninverse monoid: effective groupoids correspond to fundamental Tarski inverse\nmonoids and minimal groupoids correspond to $0$-simplifying Tarski inverse\nmonoids. Particularly interesting are the principal groupoids which correspond\nto Tarski inverse monoids where every element is a finite join of\ninfinitesimals and idempotents. Here an infinitesimal is simply a non-zero\nelement with square zero. Such inverse monoids are natural infinite\ngeneralizations of finite symmetric inverse monoids. The groups of units of\nfundamental Tarski inverse monoids generalize the finite symmetric groups and\ninclude amongst their number the Thompson groups $G_{n,1}$ as well as the\ngroups of units of what we term AF inverse monoids, Krieger's ample groups\nbeing examples. We characterize such groups as subgroups of particular kinds of\nthe group of homeomorphisms of the Cantor space.\n",

The resulting categories contain the\ncube category $\\square$, the cube category with connections $\\square^c$, the\nextended cubical category $\\square_\\Sigma$ introduced by Isaacson, and cube\ncategories $\\square_G$ symmetrized by more general group operads $G$.

A 2-category of `regular fibrations' is\nconstructed, as well as a 2-category of `regular proarrow equipments', and it\nis shown that the two are equivalent. A regular equipment is a `cartesian\nequipment' satisfying certain axioms, and a cartesian equipment is a slight\ngeneralization of a cartesian bicategory.\n  This is done by defining a tricategory Biprof whose objects are bicategories\nand whose morphisms are category-valued profunctors, and then defining an\nequipment to be a pseudo-monad in this tricategory. The resulting notion of\nequipment is compared to several existing ones. Most importantly, this involves\nshowing that every pseudo-monad in Biprof has a Kleisli object. A strict\n2-category of equipments, over locally discrete base bicategories, is\nidentified, and cartesian equipments are defined to be the cartesian objects in\nthis 2-category. Thus cartesian equipments themselves form a 2-category, and\nthis is shown to admit a 2-fully-faithful functor from the 2-category of\nregular fibrations. The cartesian equipments in the image of this functor are\ncharacterized as those satisfying certain axioms, and hence a 2-category of\n`regular equipments' is identified that is equivalent to that of regular\nfibrations.\n  It is then shown that a regular fibration admits comprehension for predicates\nif and only if its corresponding regular equipment admits tabulation for\nmorphisms, and further that the presence of tabulations for morphisms is\nequivalent to the existence of Eilenberg--Moore objects for co-monads.

A morphism from $m$\nto $n$ in a PROP can be visualized as a string diagram with $m$ input wires and\n$n$ output wires. For a field $k$, the PROP $\\mathrm{FinVect}_k$ where\nmorphisms are $k$-linear maps is used by Baez and Erbele to study signal-flow\ndiagrams. We aim to generalize their result characterizing this PROP in terms\nof generators and relations by looking at the PROP $\\mathrm{Mat}(R)$ of\nmatrices of values in $R$, where $R$ is a commutative rig (that is, a\ngeneralization of a ring where the condition that each element has an additive\ninverse is relaxed). To this end, we show that the category of symmetric\nmonoidal functors out of $\\mathrm{Mat}(R)$ is equivalent to the category of\nbicommutative bimonoids equipped with a certain map of rigs; such functors are\ncalled algebras. By choosing $R$ correctly, we will see that the algebras of\nthe PROP $\\mathrm{FinSpan}$ of finite sets and spans between them are\nbicommutative bimonoids, while the algebras of the PROP $\\mathrm{FinRel}$ of\nfinite sets and relations between them are special bicommuative bimonoids and\nthe algebras of $\\mathrm{Mat}(\\mathbb Z)$ are bicommutative Hopf monoids.\n",

In our previous paper, we defined second non-abelian cohomology\nH2(C;D) of a small category C with coefficients in a so-called centralised\nnatural system D. We proved that H2(C;D) classifies linear extensions of C by\nD, generalising the corresponding result for abelian natural systems. For an\nabelian natural system D, the third cohomology classifies certain abelian track\ncategories. A track category is a 2-category where all 2-morphisms are\nisomorphisms. A track category is called abelian if for every 1-morphism f, the\ngroup Aut(f) is abelian. In a similar fashion to the above, we want to\ngeneralise this result for non-abelian track categories. In this paper we solve\nthis problem for the following important case: Given categories K and C and a\nfunctor ? p: K -> C, which is identity on objects and surjective on morphisms,\nand G, a centralised natural system of groups on K, we describe the equivalence\nclasses of all track categories T for which K is the underlying category and C\nis the homotopy category and G_f = Aut(f).\n",

Category theory seems to be the correct mathematical\ntheory for clarifying conceptual possibilities in this respect. In this theory,\nobjects acquire their identity either by definition, when in defining category\nwe postulate the existence of objects, or formally by the existence of identity\nmorphisms. We show that it is perfectly possible to get rid of the identity of\nobjects by definition, but the formal identity of objects remains as an\nessential element of the theory. This can be achieved by defining category\nexclusively in terms of morphisms and identity morphisms (objectless, or object\nfree, category) and, analogously, by defining category theory entirely in terms\nof functors and identity functors (categoryless, or category free, category\ntheory). With objects and categories eliminated, we focus on the \"philosophy of\narrows\" and the roles various identities play in it (identities as such,\nidentities up to isomorphism, identities up to natural isomorphism...).

Such geometric morphisms are called\n(pre-)cohesive. We may also say that $\\mathcal{E}$ is pre-cohesive (over\n$\\mathcal{S}$). In this case, the topos $\\mathcal{E}$ determines an\n$\\mathcal{S}$-enriched `homotopy' category. The purpose of the present paper is\nto study certain aspects of this homotopy theory. We introduce weakly Kan\nobjects in a pre-cohesive topos, which are analogous to Kan complexes in the\ntopos of simplicial sets. Also, given a geometric morphism $g:\\mathcal{F}\n\\to\\mathcal{E}$ between pre-cohesive toposes $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{E}$\n(over the same base), we define what it means for $g$ to preserve pieces. We\nprove that if $g$ preserves pieces then it induces an adjunction between the\nhomotopy categories determined by $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{E}$, and that the\ndirect image $g_*:\\mathcal{F}\\to \\mathcal{E}$ preserves weakly Kan objects.\nThese and other results support the intuition that the inverse image of $g$ is\n`geometric realization'. In particular, since Kan complexes are weakly Kan in\nthe pre-cohesive topos of simplicial sets, the result relating $g$ and weakly\nKan objects is analogous to the fact that the singular complex of a space is a\nKan complex.\n",

This normal\nform consists of four parts, one part based on the Jordan canonical form, one\npart made of nilpotent matrices, and two other dual parts, which we call the\nobservation and control part. The goal of this paper is to show that large\nportions of that decomposition are still valid for pairs of morphisms of\nmodules or abelian groups, and more generally in any abelian category. % This\ngives a new perspective even in the vector space case, as we have to use\nradically new proof techniques to work on abelian categories. In the vector\nspace case, we recover the full Kronecker decomposition theorem. The main\ntechnique is that of reduction, which extends readily to the abelian category\ncase. Reductions naturally arise in two flavours, which are dual to each other.\nThere are a number of properties of those reductions which extend remarkably\nfrom the vector space case to abelian categories. First, both types of\nreduction commute. Second, at each step of the reduction, one can compute three\nsequences of invariant spaces (objects in the category), which generalize the\nKronecker decomposition into nilpotent, observation and control blocks. These\nsequences indicate whether the system is reduced in one direction or the other.\nIn the category of modules, there is also a relation between these sequences\nand the resolvent set of the pair of morphisms, which generalizes the regular\npencil theorem. We also indicate how this allows to define invariant subspaces\nin the vector space case, and study the notion of strangeness as an example.\n",

The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is\nthat of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov\nprocesses, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key\nfeature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with\nmultiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that\nmay then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network.\nThe components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in\nthis language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by\nintroducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic\nlanguages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic\ninterpretation gives a hypergraph functor.\n  The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories.\nIn particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations.\nDecorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories\nfrom diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are\nmodelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components\nthemselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through\ndecorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that\npermits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors.\nThese are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic\nlanguages and functors from diagrams to the semantics. To illustrate these\nprinciples, the second part of this thesis details applications to linear\ntime-invariant dynamical systems and passive linear networks.\n",

Further utilizing the\nexisting notion of transformation double category $(\\mathcal{X}_{1}\n\\rtimes_{\\mathbf{F_{1}}} \\mathbf{B}_{1}) /\\!\\!/ \\mathbf{2G}$, we demonstrate\nthat a hierarchy of bases naturally leads one from 2-groups to n-category\ntheory.

In particular, a presentation of a monoid by a finite\nconvergent rewriting system gives an algorithm to decide the word problem for\nthis monoid. Squier proved that there exists a finitely presented monoid whose\nword problem was decidable but which did not admit a finite convergent\npresentation. To do so, Squier constructed, for any convergent presentation\n$(G,R)$ of a monoid $M$, a set of syzygies $S$ corresponding to relations\nbetween the relations. This construction was later extended into the\nconstruction of a polygraphic resolution $\\Sigma$ of $M$, whose first\ndimensions coincide with Squier's construction $(G,R,S)$.\n  However, the construction of the polygraphic resolution has proved to be too\ncomplicated to be effectively computed on non-trivial examples. Cubical\ncategories appear to be a promising framework where Squier's theorem and the\nconstruction of the polygraphic resolution would be more straightforward.\n  This paper is the first step towards this goal. We start by defining the\nnotion of $(2,k)$-cubical categories. We then adapt some classical notions of\nword rewriting to this cubical setting.

These concepts allow us to prove a\nlimit lifting theorem which unifies and generalizes three different previously\nknown results of $2$-dimensional monad theory. Explicitly, by considering the\nthree choices of $\\Omega$ above our theorem has as corollaries the lifting of\noplax (resp. $\\sigma$, which generalizes lax and pseudo, resp. strict) limits\nto the $2$-categories of lax (resp. pseudo, resp. strict) morphisms of\n$T$-algebras.\n",

Bubenik et al. subsequently extended\nthe definition to categories of functors on a poset, the objects in these\ncategories being regarded as `generalized persistence modules'. These metrics\ntypically depend on the choice of a lax semigroup of endomorphisms of the\nposet. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a more general framework\nfor the notion of interleaving distance using the theory of `actegories'.\nSpecifically, we extend the notion of interleaving distance to arbitrary\ncategories equipped with a flow, i.e. a lax monoidal action by the monoid\n$[0,\\infty)$. In this way, the class of objects in such a category acquires the\nstructure of a Lawvere metric space. Functors that are colax\n$[0,\\infty)$-equivariant yield maps that are $1$-Lipschitz. This leads to\nconcise proofs of various known stability results from TDA, by considering\nappropriate colax $[0,\\infty)$-equivariant functors. Along the way, we show\nthat several common metrics, including the Hausdorff distance and the\n$L^{\\infty}$-norm, can be realized as interleaving distances in this general\nperspective.\n",

The established\nnotion of a univalent category (Ahrens, Kapulkin, Shulman) solves this by\nconsidering only truncated types, roughly corresponding to an ordinary\ncategory. This fails to capture many naturally occurring structures, stemming\nfrom the fact that the naturally occurring structures in homotopy type theory\nare not ordinary, but rather higher categories.\n  Out of the large variety of approaches to higher category theory that\nmathematicians have proposed, we believe that, for type theory, the simplicial\nstrategy is best suited. Work by Lurie and Harpaz motivates the following\ndefinition. Given the first (n+3) levels of a semisimplicial type S, we can\nequip S with three properties: first, contractibility of the types of certain\nhorn fillers; second, a completeness property; and third, a truncation\ncondition. We call this a complete semi-Segal n-type. This is very similar to\nan earlier suggestion by Schreiber.\n  The definition of a univalent (1-) category can easily be extended or\nrestricted to the definition of a univalent n-category (more precisely,\n(n,1)-category) for n in {0,1,2}, and we show that the type of complete\nsemi-Segal n-types is equivalent to the type of univalent $n$-categories in\nthese cases. Thus, we believe that the notion of a complete semi-Segal n-type\ncan be taken as the definition of a univalent n-category.\n  We provide a formalisation in the proof assistant Agda using a completely\nexplicit representation of semi-simplicial types for levels up to 4.\n",

This paper presents the parallel\ndevelopment for integration by axiomatizing an integral transformation, $s_A:\n!A \\to !A \\otimes A$, in a symmetric monoidal category with a coalgebra\nmodality. When integration is combined with differentiation, the two\nfundamental theorems of calculus are expected to hold (in a suitable sense): a\ndifferential category with integration which satisfies these two theorem is\ncalled a {\\em calculus category\\/}.\n  Modifying an approach to antiderivatives by T. Ehrhard, we define having\nantiderivatives as the demand that a certain natural transformation, $K: !A \\to\n!A$, is invertible. We observe that a differential category having\nantiderivatives, in this sense, is always a calculus category.\n  When the coalgebra modality is monoidal, it is natural to demand an extra\ncoherence between integration and the coalgebra modality. In the presence of\nthis extra coherence we show that a calculus category with a monoidal coalgebra\nmodality has its integral transformation given by antiderivatives and, thus,\nthat the integral structure is uniquely determined by the differential\nstructure.\n  The paper finishes by providing a suite of separating examples. Examples of\ndifferential categories, integral categories, and calculus categories based on\nboth monoidal and (mere) coalgebra modalities are presented.

The first central notion of this\nthesis is a common generalisation of these, which we call a proto-theory. In\norder to define models of a proto-theory in a category, we need a way of\nrelating the arities of the proto-theory with the objects of the category. This\nleads to our second central notion, that of an interpretation of arities, or\naritation for short. We show that every aritation gives rise to a semantics\nfunctor sending proto-theories to models. In fact this functor always has an\nadjoint, giving a structure-semantics adjunction. Furthermore, we show that the\nsemantics of proto-theories generalises the classical semantics of many\nexisting notions of algebraic theory.\n  Another aim of this thesis is to find a convenient category of monads in the\nfollowing sense. Every right adjoint gives rise to a monad on its codomain, and\nmore generally so does any functor that admits a codensity monad. However, not\nall functors have codensity monads. This means that the semantics functor for\nmonads on a category, viewed as a functor into the category of all functors\ninto the base category, does not have a left adjoint. We seek a generalisation\nof monads with a semantics functor that does have a left adjoint.\n  This can be accomplished with proto-theories, but at a cost. The classical\nsemantics functor for monads is full and faithful; this is a kind of\ncompleteness theorem, and is highly desirable in a notion of algebraic theory.\nHowever, the semantics functor for general proto-theories is not full and\nfaithful. Thus we seek a generalisation of monads and their semantics for which\nthe semantics functor is both full and faithful and has a left adjoint. We show\nthat such a generalisation is given, for suitable base categories, by a certain\nkind of topological proto-theory.\n",

In a poly-bicategory, the\nexistence of enough 2-cells satisfying certain universal properties\n(representability) induces coherent algebraic structure on the 2-graph of\nsingle-input, single-output 2-cells. A special case of this theory was used by\nHermida to produce a proof of strictification for bicategories. No full\nstrictification is possible for higher-dimensional categories, seemingly due to\nproblems with 2-cells that have degenerate boundaries; it was conjectured by C.\nSimpson that semi-strictification excluding units may be possible.\n  We study poly-bicategories where 2-cells with degenerate boundaries are\nbarred, and show that we can recover the structure of a bicategory through a\ndifferent construction of weak units. We prove that the existence of these\nunits is equivalent to the existence of 1-cells satisfying lower-dimensional\nuniversal properties, and study the relation between preservation of units and\nuniversal cells.\n  Then, we introduce merge-bicategories, a variant of poly-bicategories with\nmore composition operations, which admits a natural monoidal closed structure,\ngiving access to higher morphisms. We derive equivalences between morphisms,\ntransformations, and modifications of representable merge-bicategories and the\ncorresponding notions for bicategories. Finally, we prove a\nsemi-strictification theorem for representable merge-bicategories with a choice\nof composites and units.\n",

Roughly, these invariants\nare sets of subcategories in a given category and their quotients. The\nnon-commutative curve-counting invariants are obtained by restricting the\nsubcategories to be equivalent to $D^b(K(l))$. The general definition defines\nmuch larger class of invariants and many of them behave properly with respect\nto fully faithful functors. Here, after recalling the definition, we focus on\nexamples and extend our studies beyond counting. We enrich our invariants with\nstructures: the inclusion of subcategories makes them partially ordered sets,\nand considering semi-orthogonal pairs of subcategories as edges amount to\ndirected graphs. In addition to computing the non-commutative curve-counting\ninvariants in $D^b(Q)$ for two affine quivers, for $ A_n$ and $D_4$ we derive\nformulas for counting of the subcategories of type $D^b(A_k)$ in $D^b(A_n)$,\nwhereas for the two affine quivers and for $D_4$ we determine and count all\ngenerated by an exceptional collection subcategories. Estimating the numbers\ncounting non-commutative curves in $D^b({\\mathbb P}^2)$ modulo group action we\nprove finiteness and that an exact determining of these numbers leads to\nproving (or disproving) of Markov conjecture. Regarding the mentioned structure\nof a partially ordered set we initiate intersection theory of non-commutative\ncurves. Via the structure of a directed graph we build an analogue to the\nclassical curve complex used in Teichmueller and Thurston theory. The paper\ncontains many pictures of graphs and presents an approach to Markov Conjecture\nvia counting of subgraphs in a graph associated with $D^b(P^2)$.

A prop is a strict symmetric monoidal category where\nthe objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by\naddition. In this approach, electrical circuits make up the morphisms in a\nprop, as do signal-flow diagrams, and bond graphs. A network, such as an\nelectrical circuit, with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to\n$n$, while putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them\nside by side is tensoring. Here we work out the details of this approach for\nvarious kinds of electrical circuits, then signal-flow diagrams, and then bond\ngraphs. Each kind of network corresponds to a mathematically natural prop. We\nalso describe the \"behavior\" of electrical circuits, bond graphs, and\nsignal-flow diagrams using morphisms between props. To assign a behavior to a\nnetwork we \"black box\" the network, which forgets its inner workings and\nrecords only the relation it imposes between inputs and outputs. The process of\nblack-boxing a network then corresponds to a morphism between props.\nInterestingly, there are two different behaviors for any bond graph, related by\na natural transformation. To achieve all of this we first prove some\nfoundational results about props. These results let us describe any prop in\nterms of generators and equations, and also define morphisms of props by naming\nwhere the generators go and checking that relevant equations hold. Technically,\nthe key tools are the Rosebrugh--Sabadini--Walters result relating circuits to\nspecial commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and\nsignatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are\nequivalent to props.\n",

Comparing with the\nmonoidal structure on the category of interval sets discussed in the author's\nprevious work, we obtain a monoidal functor connecting these two categories. It\nwill be shown that this actually induces a fully faithful functor on monoid\nobjects and does not change the underlying sets, so we obtain a required\nembedding. The conditions for crossed interval groups to belong to the\nessential image will be proposed; namely in terms of commutativity of certain\nelements. As a result, it will turn out that the group operads form a\nreflective subcategory of the category of crossed interval groups.

Here we revisit the formalism and, in\nparticular, examine the two different approaches to defining differentiation\nwhich were introduced. The basic approach used a deriving transformation, while\na more refined approach, in the presence of a bialgebra modality, used a\ncodereliction. The latter approach is particularly relevant to linear logic\nsettings, where the coalgebra modality is monoidal and the Seely isomorphisms\ngive rise to a bialgebra modality. Here, we prove that these apparently\ndistinct notions of differentiation, in the presence of a monoidal coalgebra\nmodality, are completely equivalent. Thus, for linear logic settings, there is\nonly one notion of differentiation.\n  This paper also presents a number of separating examples for coalgebra\nmodalities including examples which are and are not monoidal, as well as\nexamples which do and do not support differential structure. Of particular\ninterest is the observation that -- somewhat counter-intuitively --\ndifferential algebras never induce a differential category although they\nprovide a monoidal coalgebra modality. On the other hand, Rota-Baxter algebras\n-- which are usually associated with integration -- provide an example of a\ndifferential category which has a non-monoidal coalgebra modality.\n",

A\nsignificant portion of quantum physics, however, involves reasoning about\ninfinite dimensional processes, and it is well-known that the category of all\nHilbert spaces is not compact closed. Thus, a limitation of using dagger\ncompact closed categories is that one cannot directly accommodate reasoning\nabout infinite dimensional processes.\n  A natural categorical generalization of compact closed categories, in which\ninfinite dimensional spaces can be modelled, is *-autonomous categories and,\nmore generally, linearly distributive categories. This article starts the\ndevelopment of this direction of generalizing categorical quantum mechanics. An\nimportant first step is to establish the behaviour of the dagger in these more\ngeneral settings. Thus, these notes simultaneously develop the categorical\nsemantics of multiplicative dagger linear logic.\n  The notes end with the definition of a mixed unitary category. It is this\nstructure which is subsequently used to extend the key features of categorical\nquantum mechanics.\n",

While $q$\nones of the pseudomonoid structures of $A^t$ are lifted along the `forgetful'\n1-cell $A^t \\to A$, the other $p$ ones are lifted along its left adjoint. In\nthe particular example when $\\mathcal M$ is an appropriate 2-subcategory of\n$\\mathsf{Cat}$, this yields a conceptually different proof of some recent\nresults due to Aguiar, Haim and L\\'opez Franco.\n",

Such a theory has the potential to serve as\nan attractive foundation for a computer proof assistant for higher category\ntheory, since it allows composites to be uniquely described, and relieves\nproofs from the bureaucracy of associators, unitors and their coherence.\nHowever, this basic theory lacks a high-level way to construct homotopies,\nwhich would be intractable to build directly in complex situations; it is not\ntherefore immediately amenable to implementation.\n  We tackle this problem by describing a contraction operation, which\nalgorithmically constructs complex homotopies that reduce the lengths of\ncomposite terms. This contraction procedure allows building of nontrivial\nproofs by repeatedly contracting subterms, and also allows the contraction of\nthose proofs themselves, yielding in some cases single-step witnesses for\ncomplex homotopies. We prove correctness of this procedure by showing that it\nlifts connected colimits from a base category to a category of zigzags, a\nprocedure which is then iterated to yield a contraction mechanism in any\ndimension. We also present homotopy.io, an online proof assistant that\nimplements the theory of associative $n$-categories, and use it to construct a\nrange of examples that illustrate this new contraction mechanism.\n",

The ubiquity of\nalgebraic structures in mathematics and related fields has given rise to\nseveral variants of universal algebra, such as symmetric operads, non-symmetric\noperads, generalised operads, and monads. These variants of universal algebra\nare called notions of algebraic theory. In the first part of this thesis, we\ndevelop a unified framework for notions of algebraic theory which includes all\nof the above examples. Our key observation is that each notion of algebraic\ntheory can be identified with a monoidal category, in such a way that theories\ncorrespond to monoid objects therein. We introduce a categorical structure\ncalled metamodel, which underlies the definition of models of theories. We also\nconsider morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal\nversion of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint\npair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform way to establish isomorphisms\nbetween categories of models in different notions of algebraic theory. A\ngeneral structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical\nuniversal property of categories of models are also shown.\n  In the second part of this thesis, we shift from the general study of\nalgebraic structures, and focus on a particular algebraic structure: higher\ndimensional categories. Among several existing definitions of higher\ndimensional categories, we choose to look at the one proposed by Batanin and\nlater refined by Leinster. We show that the notion of extensive category plays\na central role in Batanin and Leinster's definition.

Secondly, one constructs the exact hull\n$\\mathcal{E}{/\\mkern-6mu/} \\mathcal{A}$ of $\\mathcal{E}[S_\\mathcal{A}^{-1}]$\nand shows that this satisfies the 2-universal property of a quotient amongst\nexact categories.\n  In this paper, we show that this quotient $\\mathcal{E} \\to \\mathcal{E}\n{/\\mkern-6mu/} \\mathcal{A}$ induces a Verdier localization\n$\\mathbf{D}^b(\\mathcal{E}) \\to \\mathbf{D}^b(\\mathcal{E} {/\\mkern-6mu/}\n\\mathcal{A})$ of bounded derived categories. Specifically, (i) we study the\nderived category of a one-sided exact category, (ii) we show that the\nlocalization $\\mathcal{E} \\to \\mathcal{E}[S_\\mathcal{A}^{-1}]$ induces a\nVerdier quotient $\\mathbf{D}^b(\\mathcal{E}) \\to\n\\mathbf{D}^b(\\mathcal{E}[S^{-1}_\\mathcal{A}])$, and (iii) we show that the\nnatural embedding of a one-sided exact category $\\mathcal{F}$ into its exact\nhull $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}$ lifts to a derived equivalence\n$\\mathbf{D}^b(\\mathcal{F}) \\to \\mathbf{D}^b(\\overline{\\mathcal{F}})$.\n  We furthermore show that the Verdier localization is compatible with several\nenhancements of the bounded derived category, so that the above Verdier\nlocalization can be used in the study of localizing invariants, such as\nnon-connective $K$-theory.\n",

In this\nthesis we study the dagger in its own right and show how basic category theory\nadapts to dagger categories.\n  We develop a notion of a dagger limit that we show is suitable in the\nfollowing ways: it subsumes special cases known from the literature; dagger\nlimits are unique up to unitary isomorphism; a wide class of dagger limits can\nbe built from a small selection of them; dagger limits of a fixed shape can be\nphrased as dagger adjoints to a diagonal functor; dagger limits can be built\nfrom ordinary limits in the presence of polar decomposition; dagger limits\ncommute with dagger colimits in many cases.\n  Using cofree dagger categories, the theory of dagger limits can be leveraged\nto provide an enrichment-free understanding of limit-colimit coincidences in\nordinary category theory. We formalize the concept of an ambilimit, and show\nthat it captures known cases. As a special case, we show how to define\nbiproducts up to isomorphism in an arbitrary category without assuming any\nenrichment. Moreover, the limit-colimit coincidence from domain theory can be\ngeneralized to the unenriched setting and we show that, under suitable\nassumptions, a wide class of endofunctors has canonical fixed points.\n  The theory of monads on dagger categories works best when all structure\nrespects the dagger: the monad and adjunctions should preserve the dagger, and\nthe monad and its algebras should satisfy the so-called Frobenius law. Then any\nmonad resolves as an adjunction, with extremal solutions given by the\ncategories of Kleisli and Frobenius-Eilenberg-Moore algebras, which again have\na dagger.\n",

It has\nbeen previously observed that $\\mathbb{S}$ is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the\ncoalgebra obtained by completing the initial algebra, where the latter was\nobserved to be final when morphisms are restricted to short maps. This raised\nthe question \"Is $\\mathbb{S}$ the final coalgebra in the Lipschitz setting?\".\nThe results of this paper show that the natural setup is to consider all\ncontinuous functions. The description of the final coalgebra as the Cauchy\ncompletion of the initial algebra has been explicitly used to determine the\nmediating morphism from a given coalgebra to the the final coalgebra. This has\nbeen used to show that if the structure map of a coalgebra is continuous, then\nso is the mediating morphism. The description of $\\mathbb{S}$ given here not\nonly generalizes previous observations, but also unifies classical descriptions\nof $\\mathbb{S}$. We also show, by means of an example, that $\\mathbb{S}$ is not\nthe final coalgebra if we consider only Lipschitz maps.\n",

To assume the role of the powerset\nfunctor we consider \"powerset-like\" functors based on the Hausdorff\n$\\mathsf{V}$-category structure.

Further, these measurings between Lie algebras satisfy nice\nadjoint like properties with respect to universal enveloping algebras.\n  More generally, we introduce and undertake a detailed study of the notion of\ncoalgebra measuring between algebras over any operad $\\mathcal O$.

The corresponding class of\ncategories of assemblies is closed both under taking small products and under\nslicing, which is to be contrasted with the situation for ordinary PCAs. We\ndescribe these two constructions explicitly at the level of PCAs, allowing us\nto compute a number of examples of products and slices of PCAs.

This category has small products,\nwhich correspond to the small products of categories of assemblies, and it has\nfinite coproducts in a weak sense.

A differential exponential map is an\nendomorphism which is compatible with the differential combinator in such a way\nthat generalizations of $e^0 = 1$, $e^{x+y} = e^x e^y$, and $\\frac{\\partial\ne^x}{\\partial x} = e^x$ all hold. Every differential exponential map induces a\ncommutative rig, which we call a differential exponential rig, and conversely,\nevery differential exponential rig induces a differential exponential map. In\nparticular, differential exponential maps can be defined without the need of\nlimits, converging power series, or unique solutions of certain differential\nequations -- which most Cartesian differential categories do not necessarily\nhave. That said, we do explain how every differential exponential map does\nprovide solutions to certain differential equations, and conversely how in the\npresence of unique solutions, one can derivative a differential exponential\nmap. Examples of differential exponential maps in the Cartesian differential\ncategory of real smooth functions include the exponential function, the complex\nexponential function, the split complex exponential function, and the dual\nnumbers exponential function. As another source of interesting examples, we\nalso study differential exponential maps in the coKleisli category of a\ndifferential category.\n",

These are operad-like structures that admit a contraction operation as\nwell as an operadic multiplication. Their combinatorics are governed by graphs\nthat admit cycles, and are known for their complexity. In 2011, Joyal and Kock\nintroduced a powerful graphical formalism for modular operads. This paper\nextends that work. A monad for modular operads is constructed and a\ncorresponding nerve theorem is proved, using Weber's abstract nerve theory, in\nthe terms originally stated by Joyal and Kock. This is achieved using a\ndistributive law that sheds new light on the combinatorics of modular operads.\n",

However, the tensor product on\nthis category is not the usual one, but rather a warping of it by a certain\nmonoidal comonad $Q$. Thus the enrichment base is not a monoidal category in\nthe usual sense, but rather a skew monoidal category in the sense of\nSzlach\\'anyi. Our first main result is that cartesian differential categories\nare the same as categories with finite products enriched over this skew\nmonoidal base.\n  The comonad $Q$ involved is, in fact, an example of a differential modality.\nDifferential modalities are a kind of comonad on a symmetric monoidal\n$k$-linear category with the characteristic feature that their co-Kleisli\ncategories are cartesian differential categories. Using our first main result,\nwe are able to prove our second one: that every small cartesian differential\ncategory admits a full, structure-preserving embedding into the cartesian\ndifferential category induced by a differential modality (in fact, a monoidal\ndifferential modality on a monoidal closed category -- thus, a model of\nintuitionistic differential linear logic).

These characterisations mimic\nanalogous well-known results from the model theory of modules. The proof\ninvolves two approaches. In the first approach we adapt arguments from the\nmodule-theoretic setting. Here the one-sorted language of modules over a fixed\nring is replaced with a canonical multi-sorted language, whose sorts are given\nby compact objects. Throughout we use a variation of the Yoneda embedding,\ncalled the resticted Yoneda functor, which associates a multi-sorted structure\nto each object. The second approach is to translate statements using this\nfunctor. In particular, results about $\\Sigma$-pure-injectives in triangulated\ncategories are deduced from results about $\\Sigma$-injective objects in\nGrothendieck categories. Combining the two approaches highlights a connection\nbetween sorted pp-definable subgroups and annihilator subobjects of generators\nin the functor category. Our characterisation motivates the introduction of\nwhat we call endoperfect objects, which generalise endofinite objects.\n",

The purpose of this work is to show how to construct a\nsimilar monad which will allow us to formulate weak $\\omega$-categorifications\nof any equational algebraic theory. We first review the classical theory of\noperads and PROs. We then present how Leinster's globular operads can be\nextended to a theory of globular PROs via categorical enrichment over the\ncategory of collections. It is then shown how a process called globularization\nallows us to construct from a classical PRO P a globular PRO whose algebras are\nthose algebras for P which are internal to the category of strict\n$\\omega$-categories and strict $\\omega$-functors. Leinster's notion of a\ncontraction structure on a globular operad is then extended to this setting of\nglobular PROs in order to build a monad whose algebras are weakenings of the\nglobularization of the classica PRO P. Among these weakenings is the initial\nweakining whose algebras are by construction the fully weakened\n$\\omega$-categorifications of the algebraic theory encoded by P.\n",

Within the framework of\nGrothendieck's fibrational category theory, we present a web of fundamental\n2-adjunctions surrounding the formation of the category of all small diagrams\nin a given category and the formation of the Grothendieck category of a functor\ninto the category of small categories. We demonstrate the utility of these\nadjunctions, in part by deriving three formulae for (co-)limits: a `twisted'\ngeneralization of the well-known Fubini formula, as first established by\nChach\\'{o}lski and Scherer; a new `general colimit decomposition formula'; and\na special case of the general formula, which actually initiated this work, and\nwhich was proved independently by Batanin and Berger. We give three proofs for\nthis colimit decomposition formula, using methods that provide quite distinct\ninsights.\n  The `base' of our web of 2-adjunctions extends earlier work of the Ehresmann\nschool and Guitart and promises to be of independent interest. It involves\nforming the diagram category of an arbitrary functor, seen as an object of the\narrow category of the category of locally small categories, rather than that of\na mere category. The left adjoint of the emerging generalized Guitart\n2-adjunction factors through the 2-equivalence of split Grothendieck\n(co-)fibrations and strictly (co-)indexed categories, which we present here\nmost generally by allowing 2-dimensional variation in the base categories.\n",

Many ad hoc solutions to this\nremarkable shortcoming have been found, but a general theory of\ncompositionality was missing until Petric, in 2003, introduced the concept of\ng-dinatural transformations, that is, dinatural transformations together with\nan appropriate graph: he showed how acyclicity of the composite graph of two\narbitrary dinatural transformations is a sufficient and essentially necessary\ncondition for the composite transformation to be in turn dinatural. Here we\npropose an alternative, semantic rather than syntactic, proof of Petric's\ntheorem, which the authors independently rediscovered with no knowledge of its\nprior existence; we then use it to define a generalised functor category, whose\nobjects are functors of mixed variance in many variables, and whose morphisms\nare transformations that happen to be dinatural only in some of their\nvariables. We also define a notion of horizontal composition for dinatural\ntransformations, extending the well known version for natural transformations,\nand prove it is associative and unitary. Horizontal composition embodies\nsubstitution of functors into transformations and vice-versa, and is\nintuitively reflected from the string-diagram point of view by substitution of\ngraphs into graphs.\n",

Much work has already\nbeen done in this direction, but there is a problem: the notion of isomorphism\nbetween decorated cospans is often too restrictive. Here we introduce and\ncompare two ways around this problem: structured cospans, and a new version of\ndecorated cospans. Structured cospans are very simple: given a functor $L\n\\colon \\mathsf{A} \\to \\mathsf{X}$, a `structured cospan' is a diagram in\n$\\mathsf{X}$ of the form $L(a) \\rightarrow x \\leftarrow L(b)$. If $\\mathsf{A}$\nand $\\mathsf{X}$ have finite colimits and $L$ is a left adjoint, there is a\nsymmetric monoidal category whose objects are those of $\\mathsf{A}$ and whose\nmorphisms are isomorphism classes of structured cospans. However, this category\narises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal double category.\nUnder certain conditions this symmetric monoidal double category is equivalent\nto one built using our new version of decorated cospans.

We define some properties we expect to hold in any\nreasonable definition of a weak $\\omega$-category. With these properties we\ndefine three notions of invertibility inspired by homotopy type theory. These\nare quasi-invertibility, where a two sided inverse is required,\nbi-invertibility, where a separate left and right inverse is given, and\nhalf-adjoint inverse, which is a quasi-inverse with an extra coherence\ncondition. These definitions take the form of coinductive data structures.\nUsing coinductive proofs we are able to show that these three notions are all\nequivalent in that given any one of these invertibility structures, the others\ncan be obtained. The methods used to do this are generic and it is expected\nthat the results should be applicable to any reasonable model of higher\ncategory theory.

Given a 2-category\n$\\mathcal{C}$, we define the 2-category $2$-$\\mathcal{P}ro(\\mathcal{C})$ whose\nobjects we call 2-pro-objects. We prove that\n$2\\hbox{-}\\mathcal{P}ro(\\mathcal{C})$ has all the expected basic properties\nadequately relativized to the 2-categorical setting, including the\ncorresponding universal property. We give an adecuate definition of closed\n2-model 2-category and demonstrations of its basic properties. We leave for a\nfuture work the construction of its homotopy 2-category. Finally, we prove that\nour 2-category $2\\hbox{-}\\mathcal{P}ro(\\mathcal{C})$ has a closed 2-model\n2-category structure provided that $\\mathcal{C}$ has one.\n  Part of the motivation of this work was to develop a conceptual framework to\nhandle the $\\check{C}$ech nerve in homotopy theory, in particular in strong\nshape theory. The $\\check{C}$ech nerve is indexed by the categories of covers\nand of hypercovers, with cover refinements as morphisms, which are not filtered\ncategories, but determine 2-filtered 2-categories on which the $\\check{C}$ech\nnerve is also defined, sends 2-cells into homotopies, and determines a\n2-pro-object of simplicial sets. Usually, the $\\check{C}$ech nerve has to be\nconsidered as a pro-object in the homotopy category, loosing the information\nencoded in the explicit homotopies.\n",

Secondly, in \\cite{Gabi} the question was\nraised: which would be an alternative notion to intercategories of Grandis and\nPar\\'e, so that monoids in B\\\"ohm's monoidal category $(Dbl,\\ot)$ of strict\ndouble categories and strict double functors with a Gray type monoidal product\nbe an example of it? We obtain and prove that precisely the monoidal structure\nof $(Dbl,\\ot)$ resolves the first question. On the other hand, resolving the\nsecond question, we upgrade the category $Dbl$ to a tricategory $\\DblPs$ and\npropose %an alternative definition of intercategories as to consider internal\ncategories in this tricategory. %, enabling monoids in $(Dbl,\\ot)$ to be\nexamples of this gadget. Apart from monoids in $(Dbl,\\ot)$ - more importanlty,\nweak pseudomonoids in a tricategory containing $(Dbl,\\ot)$ as a sub 1-category\n- most of the examples of intercategories are also examples of this gadget, the\nones that escape are those that rely on laxness of the product on the pullback,\nas duoidal categories. For the latter purpose we define categories internal to\ntricategories (of the type of $\\DblPs$), which simultaneously serves our third\nmotive. Namely, inspired by the tricategory and $(1\\times 2)$-category of\ntensor categories, we prove under mild conditions that categories enriched over\ncertain type of tricategories may be made into categories internal in them. We\nillustrate this occurrence for tensor categories with respect to the ambient\ntricategory $2\\x\\Cat_{wk}$ of 2-categories, pseudofunctors, pseudonatural\ntransformations and modifications.\n",

We make\nthis intuition precise by means of the \"partial evaluations\" sitting in the\nso-called bar construction of monads. The (pseudo)monads of interest for\nforming colimits are the monad of diagrams and the monad of small presheaves,\nboth on the (huge) category CAT of locally small categories. Throughout,\nparticular care is taken to handle size issues, which are notoriously delicate\nin the context of free cocompletion.\n  We spell out, with all 2-dimensional details, the structure maps of these\npseudomonads. Then, based on a detailed general proof of how the\n\"restriction-of-scalars\" construction of monads extends to the case of\npseudoalgebras over pseudomonads, we define a morphism of monads between them,\nwhich we call \"image\". This morphism allows us in particular to generalize the\nidea of \"confinal functors\" i.e. of functors which leave colimits invariant in\nan absolute way. This generalization includes the concept of absolute colimit\nas a special case.\n  The main result of this paper spells out how a pointwise left Kan extension\nof a diagram corresponds precisely to a partial evaluation of its colimit. This\ncategorical result is analogous to what happens in the case of probability\nmonads, where a conditional expectation of a random variable corresponds to a\npartial evaluation of its center of mass.\n",

However, the composition of symmetric lenses does not preserve the\nproperty that the lenses can be represented by cospans -- two such symmetric\nlenses may (and frequently do) compose to form a symmetric lens which cannot be\nrepresented as a cospan of asymmetric lenses. Thus preserving the factorisation\nto show how cospans of asymmetric lenses might be used in implementations\nbecomes important. In 2018, the first work on multilenses was begun.\nMultilenses can be represented as multi-spans of asymmetric lenses (often\ncalled 'wide spans', these are spans with an arbitrary finite number of legs).\nIn this paper we analyse a small but realistic example of a supply chain in\nwhich the cospan representations would be 'composed away' by ordinary symmetric\nlens composition, and introduce a new kind of composition which we call\n'fusion' in which two ordinary symmetric lenses (spans with two legs) fuse to\nform a multilens with three legs preserving the cospan representations, and\nmore generally, two symmetric multilenses, spans with say m and n legs, fuse to\nform a symmetric multilens with m+n-1 legs, again preserving cospan\nrepresentations.\n",

The aim of the present paper is to suggest another method that\nis free from the mentioned restriction. This method is based on two main\ntheorems. Let C be a category supplied with a faithful representative functor\nto the category of sets. Theorem 1 gives a general description of automorphisms\nof C, using a new notion of a quasi-inner automorphism.

The analysis extends directly to other\nSet-based concrete categories (groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.).

The partial orders (inclusion and\nrefinement) in the lattices for the dual logics define the canonical morphisms\n(where `canonical' is always relative to the given data, not an absolute\nproperty of a morphism).

Building on recent work in applied category theory, we show how\ndeterministic dynamical systems, discrete and continuous, can be composed in a\nhierarchical style. In mathematical terms, we reformulate some existing operads\nof wiring diagrams and introduce new ones, using the general formalism of\nC-sets (copresheaves). We then establish dynamical systems as algebras of these\noperads. In a computational vein, we show that Euler's method is functorial for\nundirected systems, extending a previous result for directed systems. All of\nthe ideas in this paper are implemented as practical software using Catlab and\nthe AlgebraicJulia ecosystem, written in the Julia programming language for\nscientific computing.\n",

        "summary": "  This thesis aims to develop a compositional theory for the operational\nsemantics of networks. The networks considered are described by either internal\nor enriched graphs. In the internal case we focus on $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets, a\ngeneralization of Petri nets based on a Lawvere theory $\\mathsf{Q}$.\n$\\mathsf{Q}$-nets include many known variants of Petri nets including pre-nets,\ninteger nets, elementary net systems, and bounded nets. In the enriched case we\nfocus on graphs enriched in a quantale $R$ regarded as matrices with entries in\n$R$. These $R$-matrices represent distance networks, Markov processes, capacity\nnetworks, non-deterministic finite automata, simple graphs, and more. The\noperational semantics of $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets is constructed as an adjunction\nbetween $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets and categories internal to the category of models of\n$\\mathsf{Q}$. Similarly, the operational semantics of $R$-matrices is\nconstructed as an adjunction between $R$-matrices and categories enriched in\n$R$. The left adjoint of this adjunction sends an $R$-matrix $M$ to the\n$R$-category $F_R(M)$ whose hom-objects are solutions of the algebraic path\nproblem: a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs weighted in\n$R$. For both $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets and $R$-matrices we use the theory of\nstructured cospans to study the compositionality of the above operational\nsemantics. For each type of network we construct a double category whose\nmorphisms are \"open networks\", i.e. networks with certain vertices designated\nas input or output. We introduce the black-boxing of an open network, a\nprofunctor describing the externally observable behavior of an open network. We\nintroduce a class of open networks called \"functional open networks\" for which\nblack-boxing preserves composition.\n",

Bishop introduced the category of complemented subsets of a\nset, in order to overcome the problems generated by the use of negation in\nconstructive measure theory. Shulman mentions that Bishop's complemented\nsubsets correspond roughly to the Chu construction. In this paper we explain\nthis correspondence by showing that there is a Chu representation (a full\nembedding) of the category of complemented subsets of a set X into Chu(Set, X x\nX). A Chu representation of the category of Bishop spaces into Chu(Set, R) is\nshown, as the constructive analogue to the standard Chu representation of the\ncategory of topological spaces into Chu(Set, 2). In order to represent the\ncategory of predicates (with objects pairs (X, A), where A is a subset of X,\nand the category of complemented predicates (with objects pairs (X, A), where A\nis a complemented subset of X, we generalise the Chu construction by defining\nthe Chu category over a cartesian closed category C and an endofunctor on C.\nFinally, we introduce the antiparallel Grothendieck construction over a product\ncategory and a contra-variant Set-valued functor on it of which the Chu\nconstruction is a special case, in case C is a locally small, cartesian closed\ncategory.\n",

In this paper we find such a construction by using\nthe theory of effect algebras. We show that the real unit interval is the\nunique non-initial, non-final irreducible algebra of a particular monad on the\ncategory of bounded posets. The algebras of this monad carry an order,\nmultiplication, addition and complement, and as such model much of the\noperations we need to do on probabilities.

        "summary": "  Commuting pairs of algebraic structures on a set have been studied by several\nauthors and may be described equivalently as algebras for the tensor product of\nLawvere theories, or more basically as certain bifunctors that here we call\nbifold algebras. The much less studied notion of commutant for Lawvere theories\nwas first introduced by Wraith and generalizes the notion of centralizer clone\nin universal algebra. Working in the general setting of enriched algebraic\ntheories for a system of arities, we study the interaction of the concepts of\nbifold algebra and commutant. We show that the notion of commutant arises via a\nuniversal construction in a two-sided fibration of bifold algebras over various\ntheories. On this basis, we study special classes of bifold algebras that are\nrelated to commutants, introducing the notions of commutant bifold algebra and\nbalanced bifold algebra. We establish several adjunctions and equivalences\namong these categories of bifold algebras and related categories of algebras\nover various theories, including commutative, contracommutative, saturated, and\nbalanced algebras. We also survey and develop examples of commutant bifold\nalgebras, including examples that employ Pontryagin duality and a theorem of\nEhrenfeucht and {\\L}o\\'s on reflexive abelian groups. Along the way, we develop\na functorial treatment of fundamental aspects of bifold algebras and\ncommutants, including tensor products of theories and the equivalence of bifold\nalgebras and commuting pairs of algebras. Because we work relative to a\n(possibly large) system of arities in a closed category $\\mathcal{V}$, our main\nresults are applicable to arbitrary $\\mathcal{V}$-monads on a finitely complete\n$\\mathcal{V}$, the enriched theories of Borceux and Day, the enriched Lawvere\ntheories of Power relative to a regular cardinal, and other notions of\nalgebraic theory.\n",

We characterise dependently typed algebraic theories as\nfinitary monads on certain presheaf categories, generalising a well-known\nresult due to Lawvere, B\\'enabou and Linton for ordinary multisorted algebraic\ntheories. We use this to recognise dependently typed algebraic theories for a\nnumber of classes of algebraic structures, such as small categories,\nn-categories, strict and weak omega-categories, planar coloured operads and\nopetopic sets. We then show that every locally finitely presentable category is\nthe category of models of some dependently typed algebraic theory. Thus, with\nrespect to their Set-models, these theories are just as expressive as GATs,\nessentially algebraic theories and finite limit sketches. However, dependently\ntyped algebraic theories admit a good definition of homotopy-models in spaces,\nvia a left Bousfield localisation of a global model structure on simplicial\npresheaves. Some cases, such as certain \"idempotent opetopic theories\", have a\nrigidification theorem relating homotopy-models and (strict) simplicial models.\n  The second part of this dissertation concerns localisations of presentable\n$(\\infty,1)$-categories. We give a definition of \"pre-modulator\", and show that\nevery accessible orthogonal factorisation system on a presentable\n$(\\infty,1)$-category can be generated from a pre-modulator by iterating a\nplus-construction resembling that of sheafification. We give definitions of\n\"modulator\" and \"left-exact modulator\", and prove that they correspond to those\nfactorisation systems that are modalities and left-exact modalities\nrespectively. Thus every left-exact localisation of an $\\infty$-topos is\nobtained by iterating the plus-construction associated to a left-exact\nmodulator.\n",

This\nis illustrated first in the setting of copresheaf toposes. It is also seen\nthere that safety can be viewed as a modal statement. For these\ninterpretations, some extensions and adaptations of results in the literature\non modal operators in toposes are presented.

This has caused a split in the applied category\ntheory literature between those using optics and those using dependent lenses.\nThe goal of this paper is to unify optics with dependent lenses, by finding a\ndefinition of fibre optics admitting both as special cases.\n",

We characterise\nextensional reflexivity in compact closed categories, and consider how this may\nbe `strictified' to give monoidally equivalent categories where the\nisomorphisms exhibiting reflexivity are identity arrows.\n  This results in two-object compact closed categories consisting of a unit\nobject, and a non-unit extensionally reflexive object.\n  We study the endomorphism monoids of such `strictly extensionally reflexive'\nobjects from an algebraic viewpoint. They necessarily contain an interesting\nmonoid that may be thought of as Richard Thompson's iconic group F together\nwith the equally iconic bicyclic monoid of semigroup theory, with non-trivial\ninteractions between the two derived from the Frobenius algebra identity. We\nclaim this as a significant example of the (unitless) Frobenius algebras of\nAbramsky and Heunen.\n  We then give concrete examples, based on the algebra and category theory\nbehind the Geometry of Interaction program.

In the nerve of a small category, the dimension of the things\nwhich compose (maps) is n=1. Compositions are 2-simplices (commutative\ntriangles) in which the position of the composite is the 1-simplex opposite\nvertex i=1. These conditions generalize to all n>1 and i in {0 , ... , n+1}. We\ncall such a simplicial set an (n,i)-composer. This paper explores two aspects\nof composers: models and the algebra of such generalized composition.\n  Models: we develop a family of set-based models for composers analogous to\nsets-and-functions models for ordinary categories. The key to obtaining\nset-based models of (n,i)-composers is to observe that in the nerve of a\ncategory of sets-and-functions, a 1-simplex is a binary relation with certain\nproperties on its two faces, that is, its codomain and domain. In a model of an\n(n,i)-composer, each k-simplex is a (k+1)-ary relation on its faces having\ncertain properties, with special attention to k=n (things which compose) and\nk=n+1 (a composition of things). The development of these models is guided by\nrequiring: (i) the usual sets-and-functions model, i.e. when n=1 and i=1,\nbelongs to the family; (ii) the things which compose have properties which\nresemble and generalize properties possessed by ordinary functions.\n  Algebra: we explore some notions which are inspired by the algebra of\nordinary composition. These include \"comma-composers\" generalizing comma\ncategories, a composer structure for function complexes, representables, and a\ngeneralization of universal map.

In this\nchapter I will show an attempt to reconstruct that (imaginary) language for\nmissing diagrams: we will see an extensible diagrammatic language, called DL,\nthat follows the conventions of the diagrams in the literature of CT whenever\npossible and that seems to be adequate for drawing \"missing diagrams\" for\nCategory Theory. Our examples include the \"missing diagrams\" for adjunctions,\nfor the Yoneda Lemma, for Kan extensions, and for geometric morphisms, and how\nto formalize them in Agda.\n",

They've\nbeen defined by Tambara in the context of representation theory, but quickly\nfound their way in applications when it was understood Tambara modules provide\na useful encoding of modular data accessors known as mixed optics. To suit the\nneeds of these applications, Tambara theory has been extended to profunctors\nbetween categories receiving an action of a monoidal category. Motivated by the\ngeneralization of optics to dependently-typed contexts, we sketch a further\nextension of the theory of Tambara modules in the setting of actions of double\ncategories (thus doubly indexed categories), by defining them as horizontal\nnatural transformations. The theorems and constructions in Pastro-Street theory\nrelevant to profunctor representation theorem for mixed optics are reobtained\nin this context. This reproduces the definition of dependent optics recently\nput forward by Vertechi and Milewski, and hinted at by previous work of the\nauthor and his collaborators.\n",

For instance, the structure of augmented\nvirtual double categories naturally allows us to isolate conditions that ensure\nsmall cocompleteness of formal presheaf objects $\\hat A$.\n  Given a monoidal augmented virtual double category $\\mathcal K$ with a Yoneda\nembedding $\\text y_I \\colon I \\to \\hat I$ for its monoidal unit $I$ we prove\nthat, for any 'unital' object $A$ in $\\mathcal K$ that has a 'horizontal dual'\n$A^\\circ$, the Yoneda embedding $\\text y_A \\colon A \\to \\hat A$ exists if and\nonly if the 'inner hom' $[A^\\circ, \\hat I]$ exists.

We\nargue that, while theoretically elegant and structurally fundamental, such\npresentations of enriched monads can be inconvenient to construct directly in\npractice, as they do not directly match the definitional procedures used in\nconstructing many categories of enriched algebraic structures via operations\nand equations.\n  Retaining the above approach to presentations as a key technical\nunderpinning, we establish a flexible formalism for directly describing\nenriched algebraic structure borne by an object of a $V$-category $C$ in terms\nof parametrized $J$-ary operations and diagrammatic equations for a suitable\nsubcategory of arities $J \\hookrightarrow C$. On this basis we introduce the\nnotions of diagrammatic $J$-presentation and $J$-ary variety, and we show that\nthe category of $J$-ary varieties is dually equivalent to the category of\n$J$-ary $V$-monads. We establish several examples of diagrammatic\n$J$-presentations and $J$-ary varieties relevant in both mathematics and\ntheoretical computer science, and we define the sum and tensor product of\ndiagrammatic $J$-presentations. We show that both $J$-relative monads and\n$J$-pretheories give rise to diagrammatic $J$-presentations that directly\ndescribe their algebras. Using diagrammatic $J$-presentations as a method of\nproof, we generalize the pretheories-monads adjunction of Bourke and Garner\nbeyond the locally presentable setting. Lastly, we generalize Birkhoff's Galois\nconnection between classes of algebras and sets of equations to the above\nsetting.\n",

Linear\nbicategories are the bicategorical version of linearly distributive categories.\nEssentially, a linear bicategory has two forms of composition, each determining\nthe structure of a bicategory, and the two compositions are related by a linear\ndistribution.\n  While it is standard in the field of monoidal topology that the category of\nquantale-valued relations is a bicategory, we begin by showing that if the\nquantale is a Girard quantale, we obtain a linear bicategory. We further show\nthat the category $QRel$ for $Q$ a unital quantale is a Girard quantaloid if\nand only if $Q$ is a Girard quantale. The tropical and arctic semiring\nstructures fit together into a Girard quantale, so this construction is likely\nto have multiple applications. More generally, we define LD-quantales, which\nare sup-lattices with two quantale structures related by a linear distribution,\nand show that $QRel$ is a linear bicategory if $Q$ is an LD-quantale.\n  We then consider several standard constructions from bicategory theory, and\nshow that these lift to the linear bicategory setting and produce new examples\nof linear bicategories. In particular, we consider quantaloids. We first define\nthe notion of a linear quantaloid ${\\cal Q}$ and then consider linear ${\\cal\nQ}$-categories and linear monads in ${\\cal Q}$, where ${\\cal Q}$ is a linear\nquantaloid. Every linear quantaloid is a linear bicategory.\n  We also consider the bicategory whose objects are locales, 1-cells are\nbimodules and two-cells are bimodule homomorphisms. This bicategory turns out\nto be what we call a Girard bicategory, which are in essence a closed version\nof linear bicategories.\n",

In this\npaper, we provide characterisations of cofree Cartesian differential categories\nwithout specifying a base category. The key to these characterisations is,\nsurprisingly, maps whose derivatives are zero, which we call differential\nconstants. One characterisation is in terms of the homsets being complete\nultrametric spaces, where the ultrametric is induced by differential constants,\nwhich is similar to the metric for power series. Another characterisation is as\nalgebras of a monad. In either characterisation, the base category is the\ncategory of differential constants.

The forgetful functor from the category of lenses to the category of\nfunctors is already known to reflect monos and epis and preserve epis; we show\nthat it preserves monos, and give a simpler proof that it preserves epis.\nTogether this gives a complete characterisation of the monic and epic lenses in\nterms of elementary properties of their get functors.\n  Next, we initiate the study of coequalisers of lenses. We observe that not\nall parallel pairs of lenses have coequalisers, and that the forgetful functor\nfrom the category of lenses to the category of functors neither preserves nor\nreflects all coequalisers. However, some coequalisers are reflected; we study\nwhen this occurs, and then use what we learned to show that every epic lens is\nregular, and that discrete opfibrations have pushouts along monic lenses.\nCorollaries include that every monic lens is effective, every monic epic lens\nis an isomorphism, and the class of all epic lenses and the class of all monic\nlenses form an orthogonal factorisation system.\n",

The main result of this paper is that both the category of algebras of\nan operad and its opposite category are tangent categories. The tangent bundle\nfor the category of algebras is given by the semi-direct product, while the\ntangent bundle for the opposite category of algebras is constructed using the\nmodule of K\\\"ahler differentials, and these tangent bundles are in fact\nadjoints of one another. To prove these results, we first prove that the\ncategory of algebras of a coCartesian differential monad is a tangent category.\nWe then show that the monad associated to any operad is a coCartesian\ndifferential monad. This also implies that we can construct Cartesian\ndifferential categories from operads. Therefore, operads provide a bountiful\nsource of examples of tangent categories and Cartesian differential categories,\nwhich both recaptures previously known examples and also yield new interesting\nexamples.

For this, we find the need\nto reduce weighted 2-colimits to cartesian-marked oplax conical ones, and as a\nconsequence the need to consider lax slices. We prove results of preservation,\nreflection and lifting of 2-colimits for the domain 2-functor from a lax slice.\nWe thus generalize to dimension 2 the whole fruitful calculus of colimits in\n1-dimensional slices. We achieve this within the framework of enhanced (or\nF-)category theory. The preservation result assumes products in the base\n2-category and uses an original general theorem which states that a lax left\nadjoint preserves appropriate 2-colimits if the adjunction is strict on one\nside and suitably F-categorical. Finally, we apply the same general theorem of\npreservation of 2-colimits to the 2-functor of change of base along a split\nGrothendieck opfibration between lax slices. We prove that this change of base\n2-functor is indeed a left adjoint of the kind described above by laxifying the\nproof that Conduch\\'{e} functors are exponentiable. We conclude extending the\nresult of preservation of 2-colimits for the change of base 2-functor to any\nfinitely complete 2-category with a dense generator.\n",

A cartesian double theory is defined to be a small double\ncategory with finite products and a model of a cartesian double theory to be a\nfinite product-preserving lax functor out of it. Many familiar categorical\nstructures are models of cartesian double theories, including categories,\npresheaves, monoidal categories, braided and symmetric monoidal categories,\n2-groups, multicategories, and cartesian and cocartesian categories. We show\nthat every cartesian double theory has a unital virtual double category of\nmodels, with lax maps between models given by cartesian lax natural\ntransformations, bimodules between models given by cartesian modules, and\nmulticells given by multimodulations. In many cases, the virtual double\ncategory of models is representable, hence is a genuine double category.\nMoreover, when restricted to pseudo maps, every cartesian double theory has a\nvirtual equipment of models, hence an equipment of models in the representable\ncase. Compared with 2-monads, double theories have the advantage of being\nstraightforwardly presentable by generators and relations, as we illustrate\nthrough a large number of examples.\n",

Underpinning these\ngeneralisations is the structure of an involutive identity-on-objects\ncontravariant endofunctor, which encodes adjoints of morphisms. The R*-category\naxioms are otherwise inspired by those for abelian categories, comprising a few\nsimple properties of products and kernels. Additivity is not assumed, but\nnevertheless follows. In fact, the similarity with abelian categories runs\ndeeper: R*-categories are quasi-abelian and thus homological. Examples include\nthe category of unitary representations of a group, the category of\nfinite-dimensional inner product modules over a partially ordered division\nring, and the category of self-dual Hilbert modules over a W*-algebra.\n",

After the usual Yoneda's Lemma, Lemma 3.1, we show that the Yoneda\nfunctor $\\cc{C} \\mr{h} \\Eop{C}$ classifies functors $\\cc{C} \\mr{} \\cc{Z}$ into\nany cocomplete category $\\cc{Z}$, via a cocontinuos extension $\\Eop{C} \\mr{}\n\\cc{Z}$, Lemma 5.2. Then we reach Lemma 9.4 by an step by step enrichment of\n5.2. All we use is Yoneda's Lemma, over and over again, and the Yoga of natural\ntransformations. In Lemma 10.1 we show the equivalence between \\emph{flatness}\nand \\emph{left exactness} for functors from finitely complete categories into\nany topos. Our proof is elementary, we show how basic exactness properties of\nsets prove the result for set valued functors, then we generalize to functors\nvalued in any topos utilizing results of the previous sections and the Yoga of\nnatural transformations. Besides the thread we follow,nothing here is new,\nalthough we haven't seen 10.1 proved this way before.\n",

We\ndevelop the basic theory and examples of such products and, by duality, of\ncoproducts in double categories.

Such weights induce a metric on objects in the triangulated\ncategory, which we call a path metric. Our exact weights generalize the rank\nfunctions of J.\\ Chuang and A.\\ Lazarev and are analogous to the exact weights\nfor an exact category given by the first author and J.\\ Scott and D.\\ Stanley.\nWe show that cohomological functors from a triangulated category to an abelian\ncategory with an additive weight induce an exact weight on the triangulated\ncategory. We prove that triangle equivalences induce an isometry for the path\nmetrics induced by cohomological functors. In the perfectly generated or\ncompactly generated case, we use Brown representability to express the exact\nweight on the triangulated category. We give three characterizations of\nexactness for a weight on a triangulated category and show that they are\nequivalent. We also define Wasserstein distances for triangulated categories.\nFinally, we apply our work to derived categories of persistence modules and to\nrepresentations of continuous quivers of type $\\mathbb{A}$.\n",

It has influenced areas of computer science such as automata\ntheory, functional programming, and semantics. Certain objects naturally\nexhibit two classes of morphisms, leading to the concept of a double category,\nwhich has found applications in computing science (e.g., ornaments, profunctor\noptics, denotational semantics).\n  The emergence of diverse categorical structures motivated a unified framework\nfor category theory. However, unlike other mathematical objects, classification\nof categorical structures faces challenges due to various relevant\nequivalences. This poses significant challenges when pursuing the formalization\nof categories and restricts the applicability of powerful techniques, such as\ntransport along equivalences. This work contends that univalent foundations\noffers a suitable framework for classifying different categorical structures\nbased on desired notions of equivalences, and remedy the challenges when\nformalizing categories. The richer notion of equality in univalent foundations\nmakes the equivalence of a categorical structure an inherent part of its\nstructure.\n  We concretely apply this analysis to double categorical structures. We\ncharacterize and formalize various definitions in Coq UniMath, including\n(pseudo) double categories and double bicategories, up to chosen equivalences.\nWe also establish univalence principles, making chosen equivalences part of the\ndouble categorical structure, analyzing strict double setcategories (invariant\nunder isomorphisms), pseudo double setcategories (invariant under\nisomorphisms), univalent pseudo double categories (invariant under vertical\nequivalences) and univalent double bicategories (invariant under gregarious\nequivalences).\n",

Here we provide a survey of the theory of\nDrazin inverses from a categorical perspective. We introduce Drazin categories,\nin which every endomorphism has a Drazin inverse, and provide various examples\nincluding the category of matrices over a field, the category of finite length\nmodules over a ring, and finite set enriched categories. We also introduce the\nnotion of expressive rank and prove that a category with expressive rank is\nDrazin. Moreover, we study Drazin inverses in mere categories, in additive\ncategories, and in dagger categories. In an arbitrary category, we show how a\nDrazin inverse corresponds to an isomorphism in the idempotent splitting, as\nwell as explain how Drazin inverses relate to Leinster's notion of eventual\nimage duality. In additive categories, we consider core-nilpotent\ndecompositions, image-kernel decompositions, and Fitting decompositions. We\nalso develop the notion of Drazin inverses for pairs of opposing maps,\ngeneralizing the usual notion of Drazin inverse for endomorphisms.

In this thesis we show that every monoidal bicategory,\nwhich is closed both monoidally and compositionally, can be enriched over the\nmonoidal 2-category of scalar-enriched categories. This enrichment provides a\nnumber of key insights into the relationship between linear algebra and\ncategory theory.\n  The enrichment replaces every set of 2-cells with a scalar, and we show that\nthis replacement can be given in terms of the cotrace, first defined by Day and\nStreet in the context of profunctors. This is analogous to the construction of\nthe Frobenius inner product between linear maps, which is constructed in terms\nof the trace of linear maps. In linear algebra it is also possible to define\nthe trace in terms of the Frobenius inner product. We show that the cotrace can\nbe defined in terms of the enrichment, and in doing so we prove that the\ncotrace is an enriched version of the `categorical trace' studied by Ganter and\nKapranov, and Bartlett. Thus, we unify the concept of a categorical trace with\nthe concept of a cotrace.\n  Finally, we study the relationship between the trace and the cotrace for\ncompact closed bicategories. We show that the trace and cotrace have a\nstructured relationship and share many of the properties of the linear trace\nincluding -- but not limited to -- dual invariance and linearity. Motivating\nexamples are given throughout. We also introduce a decorated string diagram\nlanguage to simplify some of the proofs.\n",

Complex algebraic\nstructures - otherwise represented by a forest of symbols - can be encoded into\ndiagrams with intuitive graphical rules. The prevailing paradigm for\ndiagrammatic category theory are monoidal string diagrams whose specification\nreflects the axioms of monoidal categories. However, such diagrams struggle in\naccurately portraying crucial categorical constructs such as functors or\nnatural transformations, obscuring central concepts such as the Yoneda lemma or\nthe simultaneous consideration of hom-functors and products. In this work, we\nintroduce functor string diagrams, a systematic approach for the development of\ncategorical diagrams which allows functors, natural transformations, and\nproducts to be clearly represented. We validate their practicality in multiple\ndimensions. We show their usefulness for theoretical manipulations by proving\nthe Yoneda lemma, show that they encompass monoidal string diagrams and hence\ntheir helpful properties, and end by showing their exceptional applied utility\nby leveraging them to underpin neural circuit diagrams, a method which, at\nlast, allows deep learning architectures to be comprehensively and rigorously\nexpressed.\n",

Although the Cartesian\nclosure of $\\textbf{Cat}$ means these two perspectives can be used\ninterchangeably at the semantic level, a surprising amount of subtlety is\nrevealed when looking through the lens of syntax. Indeed, we prove that finite\nuncurried presentations are strictly more expressive than finite curried\npresentations, hence the two notions do not induce the same class of finitely\npresentable profunctors. Moreover, an explicit construction for the composite\nof two curried presentations shows that the class of finitely curried\npresentable profunctors is closed under composition, in contrast with the\nlarger class of finitely uncurried presentable profunctors, which is not. This\nshows that curried profunctor presentations are more appropriate for\ncomputational tasks that use profunctor composition. We package our results on\ncurried profunctor presentations into a double equivalence from a syntactic\ndouble category into the double category of profunctors. Finally, we study the\nrelationship between curried and uncurried presentations, leading to the\nintroduction of curryable presentations. These constitute a subcategory of\nuncurried presentations which is equivalent to the category of curried\npresentations, therefore acting as a bridge between the two syntactic choices.\n",

However,\ntraditional nategories abandon core categorical constructs and rely on\nextensive mathematical development. This creates a divide between the\nconsideration of positive and negative information composition. In this work,\nwe show that negative information can be considered in a natural categorical\nmanner. This is aided by functor string diagrams, a novel flexible diagrammatic\napproach that can intuitively show the operation of hom-functors and natural\ntransformations in expressions.

We contribute to this research thread\nby noticing that Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient descent depend crucially on\na consistent choice of transformation -- which we call a reaction structure --\nfrom the cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle. We then construct a\ncompositional theory of reaction structures. Reaction-based systems offer a\ndifferent perspective on composition in physics than port-Hamiltonian systems\nor open classical mechanics, in that reaction-based composition does not create\nany new constraints that must be solved for algebraically.\n  The technical contributions of this paper are the development of symmetric\nmonoidal categories of open energy-driven systems and open differential\nequations, and a functor between them, functioning as a \"functorial semantics\"\nfor reaction structures. This approach echoes what has previously been done for\nopen games and open gradient-based learners, and in fact subsumes the latter.\nWe then illustrate our theory by constructing an $n$-fold pendulum as a\ncomposite of $n$-many pendula.\n",

This is a generalization\nbecause for distributive lattices we are in the context of coherent spaces,\nwhereas frames represent arbitrary spaces. We introduce Raney extensions of\nframes, pairs $(L,C)$ where $C$ is a coframe, $L\\subseteq C$ is a frame that\nmeet-generates it, and the inclusion $L\\subseteq C$ preserves the frame\noperations as well as the strongly exact meets. We think of these as being\nalgebraic versions of the embedding $\\Omega(X)\\subseteq \\mathcal{U}(X)$ of a\nframe of opens into a lattice of saturated sets (upper sets in the\nspecialization order). We show that a frame may have several Raney extensions,\nand all satisfy a generalization of the properties of density and compactness\nfrom the theory of canonical extensions. We show that every frame $L$ has the\nlargest and the smallest Raney extension, and that these are, respectively, the\ncoframe of fitted sublocales $\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathfrak{o}}(L)$ and the opposite of\nthe frame $\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathfrak{c}}(L)$ of joins of closed sublocales. We thus\nshow that these structures have universal properties which are dual of one\nanother. For Raney extensions $(L,C)$ and $(M,D)$, we characterize the frame\nmorphisms $f:L\\to M$ which can be extended to a morphism of Raney extensions.\nWe apply this result to obtain a characterization of morphisms of frames\n$f:L\\to M$ which can be lifted to frame morphisms\n$\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathfrak{c}}(L)\\to \\mathsf{S}_{\\mathfrak{c}}(M)$. We also show\nthat the canonical extension of a locally compact frame is the free Raney\nextension over it such that it is algebraic (generated by its compact\nelements).

These ideas are expanded upon through\nthe guiding example of the category of monoids. Specifically, when a monoid is\nviewed as a one-object category, its 2-cell structures resemble semibimodules.\n",

This is an isomix LDC which is neither $*$-autonomous nor fully\nsymmetric.

To that end, we characterize the\nlinearly dual objects in $\\mathsf{Poly}$: every linear polynomial has a right\ndual which is a representable. It turns out that the linear and representable\npolynomials also form the left and right cores of $\\mathsf{Poly}$.

The second part presents a set of\nconditions on an ambient category and an internal category with an object of\nweak-equivalences that allows an internal description of the axioms for a\ncategory of (right) fractions and a definition of the internal category of\n(right) fractions when all the conditions and axioms are satisfied. These are\ncombined to present a suitable context for computing the pseudocolimit of a\nsmall filtered diagram of internal categories.\n",

We study how the difference operator interacts with limits\nand colimits as categorical versions of the usual product and sum rules. The\nfirst main result is a lax chain rule which has no counterpart for mere\nfunctions. We also show that many important classes of functors (polynomials,\nanalytic functors, reduced powers, ...) are taut, and calculate explicit\nformulas for their differences. Covariant Dirichlet series are introduced and\nstudied. The second main result is a Newton summation formula expressed as an\nadjoint to the difference operator.\n",

In recent studies of \"metric domain theory\" and Stone-type\ndualities, the more general notion of a (separated) metric compact Hausdorff\nspace emerged as a metric counterpart of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces.\nRoughly speaking, a metric compact Hausdorff space is a metric space equipped\nwith a \\emph{compatible} compact Hausdorff topology (which does not need to be\nthe induced topology). These spaces maintain many important features of compact\nmetric spaces, and, notably, the resulting category is much better behaved.\nMoreover, one can use inspiration from the theory of Nachbin's compact ordered\nspaces to solve problems for metric structures.\n  In this paper we continue this line of research: in the category of separated\nmetric compact Hausdorff spaces we characterise the regular monomorphisms as\nthe embeddings and the epimorphisms as the surjective morphisms. Moreover, we\nshow that epimorphisms out of an object $X$ can be encoded internally on $X$ by\ntheir kernel metrics, which are characterised as the continuous metrics below\nthe metric on $X$; this gives a convenient way to represent quotient objects.\nFinally, as the main result, we prove that its dual category has an algebraic\nflavour: it is Barr-exact. While we show that it cannot be a variety of\nfinitary algebras, it remains open whether it is an infinitary variety.\n",

A 2-rig is a kind of categorified \"ring\nwithout negatives\", such as a category of vector bundles with $\\oplus$ as\naddition and $\\otimes$ as multiplication. Technically, we define a 2-rig to be\na Cauchy complete $k$-linear symmetric monoidal category where $k$ has\ncharacteristic zero.

We prove this\nconjecture for the free 2-rig on one object, namely the category of Schur\nfunctors, whose Grothendieck ring is the free $\\lambda$-ring on one generator,\nalso known as the ring of symmetric functions.

Essentially, an\neffective descent morphism enables bundles over its codomain to be fully\ndescribed as bundles over its domain endowed with additional algebraic\nstructure, called descent data. Like the study of epimorphisms, studying\neffective descent morphisms is interesting in its own right, providing deeper\ninsights into the category under consideration. Moreover, studying these\nmorphisms is part of the foundations of several applications of descent theory,\nnotably including Janelidze-Galois theory, also known as categorical Galois\ntheory.\n  Traditionally, the study of effective descent morphisms has focused on\ninvestigating and exploiting the reflection properties of certain functors. In\ncontrast, we introduce a novel approach by establishing general results on the\npreservation of effective descent morphisms. We demonstrate that these\npreservation results enhance the toolkit for studying such morphisms, by\nobserving that all Grothendieck (op)fibrations satisfying mild conditions fit\nour framework. To illustrate these findings, we provide several examples of\nGrothendieck (op)fibrations that preserve effective descent morphisms,\nincluding topological functors and other forgetful functors of significant\ninterest in the literature.\n",

These characterisations are achieved through Sol\\`er's theorem, a\nresult which shows that certain orthomodularity conditions on a Hermitian space\nover an involutive division ring result in a Hilbert space with the division\nring being either the reals, complexes or quaternions. The characterisation by\nHeunen and Kornell makes use of a monoidal structure, which in turn excludes\nthe category of quaternionic Hilbert spaces. We provide an alternative\ncharacterisation without the assumption of monoidal structure on the category.\nThis new approach not only gives a new characterisation of the categories of\nreal and of complex Hilbert spaces, but also the category of quaternionic\nHilbert spaces.\n",

From the perspective\nhere afforded, many coherence results become simple statements about the\nquasi-Yoneda lemma and 2-theory-morphisms. Given two 2-theories and a\n2-theory-morphism between them, we explore the induced relationship between the\ncorresponding 2-categories of algebras. The strength of the induced\nquasi-adjoints are classified by the strength of the 2-theory-morphism. These\nquasi-adjoints reflect the extent to which one structure can be replaced by\nanother. A two-dimensional analogue of the Kronecker product is defined and\nconstructed. This operation allows one to generate new coherence laws from old\nones.\n",

The complexity is ultimately based on the\ncomplexity of finding a strategy in a formula which is, for polarized additive\nformulas, in the worst case linear in their size. Having a proof of a sequent\nis equivalent to having a strategy for the internal-hom object. In order to\nshow that the internal-hom object can have size exponentially larger than the\nformulas of the original sequent we develop techniques for calculating the size\nof the multiplicative formulas.\n  The structure of the internal hom object can be exploited and, using dynamic\nprogramming techniques, one can reduce the cost of finding a strategy in such a\nformula to the order of the product of the sizes of the original formulas. The\nuse of dynamic techniques motivates the consideration of games as acyclic\ngraphs and we show how to calculate the size of these graph games for the\nmultiplicative and additive fragment and, thus, the cost of determining their\nprovability using this dynamic programming approach.\n  The final section of the paper points out that, despite the apparent\ncomplexity of the formulas, there is, for the initial polarized logic with all\nthe connectives (additives, multiplicatives, and exponentials) a way of\ndetermining provability which is \\emph{linear} in the size of the formulas.\n",

We\nobtain a bijective correspondence between localic etale groupoids and their\nquantales, which are given a rather simple characterization and are here called\ninverse quantal frames. We show that the category of inverse quantal frames is\nequivalent to the category of complete and infinitely distributive inverse\nmonoids, and as a consequence we obtain a correspondence between these and\nlocalic etale groupoids that generalizes more classical results concerning\ninverse semigroups and topological etale groupoids. This generalization is\nentirely algebraic and it is valid in an arbitrary topos. As a consequence of\nthese results we see that a localic groupoid is etale if and only if its\nsublocale of units is open and its multiplication map is semiopen, and an\nanalogue of this holds for topological groupoids. In practice we are provided\nwith new tools for constructing localic and topological etale groupoids, as\nwell as inverse semigroups, for instance via presentations of quantales by\ngenerators and relations. The characterization of inverse quantal frames is to\na large extent based on a new quantale operation, here called a support, whose\nproperties are thoroughly investigated, and which may be of independent\ninterest.\n",

Since a 2D topological quantum field\ntheory is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra, this result also shows\nthat every 2D TQFT is obtained from an ambijunction in some 2-category. Our\ntheorem is proved by extending the theory of adjoint monads to the context of\nan arbitrary 2-category and utilizing the free completion under Eilenberg-Moore\nobjects. We then categorify this theorem by replacing the monoidal category M\nwith a semistrict monoidal 2-category M, and replacing the 2-category D into\nwhich it embeds by a semistrict 3-category. To state this more powerful result,\nwe must first define the notion of a `Frobenius pseudomonoid', which\ncategorifies that of a Frobenius object. We then define the notion of a `pseudo\nambijunction', categorifying that of an ambijunction. In each case, the idea is\nthat all the usual axioms now hold only up to coherent isomorphism.

Category theory organizes mathematics\nusing morphisms that transmit structure and determination. Structures of\nmathematical interest are usually characterized by some universal mapping\nproperty so the general thesis is that category theory is about determination\nthrough universals. In recent decades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved\nto center-stage as category theory's primary tool to characterize what is\nimportant and universal in mathematics. Hence our focus here is to present a\ntheory of adjoint functors, a theory which shows that all adjunctions arise\nfrom the birepresentations of \"chimeras\" or \"heteromorphisms\" between the\nobjects of different categories. Since representations provide universal\nmapping properties, this theory places adjoints within the framework of\ndetermination through universals. The conclusion considers some unreasonably\neffective analogies between these mathematical concepts and some central\nphilosophical themes.\n",

This paper presents a\nsystematical investigation of many-valued complete distributivity, including\nthe topics: (1) subalgebras and quotient algebras of many-valued completely\ndistributive lattices; (2) categories of (left adjoint) functors; and (3) the\nrelationship between many-valued complete distributivity and properties of the\nquantale of truth values.

For many years, a similar categorical framework\nhas been lacking for non-abelian (co)homology, the subject of which includes\nthe categories of non-abelian groups, of rings, Lie algebras, etc. The notion\nof semi-abelian category due to Janelidze, Marki and Tholen allows a unified\nstudy of many important homological properties of such categories. For\ninstance, in any semi-abelian category, the classical diagram lemmas (the Short\nFive Lemma, the 3x3 Lemma, the Snake Lemma, Noether's Isomorphism Theorems)\nhold. The point of this thesis is, that the semi-abelian framework is indeed\nperfectly suited for the study of non-abelian (co)homology and the\ncorresponding homotopy theory. It describes the foundations for a categorical\nhomology theory that unifies many basic aspects of the classical (co)homology\ntheories of e.g., groups, Lie algebras and crossed modules. Starting from\nhomology of (proper) chain complexes and of simplicial objects, a semi-abelian\nversion of Barr-Beck cotriple homology is introduced. A systematic study of the\ntheory of Baer invariants in this context yields categorical versions of Hopf's\nformula (describing the second homology object in terms of commutators) and the\nStallings-Stammbach sequence. We obtain a Universal Coefficient Theorem, a\nversion of the Hochschild-Serre sequence, and an interpretation of the second\ncohomology group in terms of isomorphism classes of central extensions. Also,\nQuillen model category structures for homotopy of simplicial objects and\ninternal categories are studied, and are shown to be compatible with the\nrespective semi-abelian notions of homology.\n",

We study the existence of the\ninternalisation of this notion, called the Hopf module construction, by\nextending the completion under Eilenberg-Moore objects of a 2-category to a\nendo-homomorphism of tricategories on $\\mathbf{Bicat}$.\n  Our main result is the equivalence between the existence of a left\ndualization for $A$ ({\\em i.e.}, $A$ is left autonomous) and the validity of an\nanalogue of the structure theorem of Hopf modules. In this case the Hopf module\nconstruction for $A$ always exists.\n  We use these results to study the lax centre of a left autonomous map\npseudomonoid. We show that the lax centre is the Eilenberg-Moore construction\nfor a certain monad on $A$ (one existing if the other does). If $A$ is also\nright autonomous, then the lax centre equals the centre.

In particular, it has recently been shown that there is a\n(non-functorial) equivalence between localic \\'etale groupoids, on one hand,\nand complete and infinitely distributive inverse semigroups (abstract complete\npseudogroups), on the other. This correspondence is mediated by a class of\nquantales, known as inverse quantal frames, that are obtained from the inverse\nsemigroups by a simple join completion that yields an equivalence of\ncategories. Hence, we can regard abstract complete pseudogroups as being\nessentially ``the same'' as inverse quantal frames, and in this paper we\nexploit this fact in order to find a suitable replacement for inverse\nsemigroups in the context of open groupoids that are not necessarily \\'etale.\nThe interest of such a generalization lies in the importance and ubiquity of\nopen groupoids in areas such as operator algebras, differential geometry and\ntopos theory, and we achieve it by means of a class of quantales, called open\nquantal frames, which generalize inverse quantal frames and whose properties we\nstudy in detail. The resulting correspondence between quantales and open\ngroupoids is not a straightforward generalization of the previous results\nconcerning \\'etale groupoids, and it depends heavily on the existence of\ninverse semigroups of local bisections of the quantales involved.\n",

The\npaper presents by generators and equations the category SplPre, whose arrows\nare the split preorders on the disjoint union of two finite ordinals. The same\nis done for the subcategory Gen of SplPre, whose arrows are equivalence\nrelations, and for the category Rel, whose arrows are the binary relations\nbetween finite ordinals, and which has an isomorphic image within SplPre by a\nmap that preserves composition, but not identity arrows. It was shown\npreviously that SplPre and Gen have an isomorphic representation in Rel in the\nstyle of Brauer. The syntactical presentation of Gen and Rel in this paper\nexhibits the particular Frobenius algebra structure of Gen and the particular\nbialgebraic structure of Rel, the latter structure being built upon the former\nstructure in SplPre. This points towards algebraic modelling of various\ncategories motivated by logic, and related categories, for which one can\nestablish coherence with respect Rel and Gen. It also sheds light on the\nrelationship between the notions of Frobenius algebra and bialgebra. The\ncompleteness of the syntactical presentations is proved via normal forms, with\nthe normal form for SplPre and Gen being in some sense orthogonal to the\ncomposition-free, i.e. cut-free, normal form for Rel. The paper ends by showing\nthat the assumptions for the algebraic structures of SplPre, Gen and Rel cannot\nbe extended with new equations without falling into triviality.\n",

In particular some aspects related to \"internal\"\n(co)limits and to Cauchy completeness are considered. In the second part, we\nmaintain that also some aspects of topology can be effectively synthesized in a\n(weak) balanced factorization category T, whose objects should be considered as\npossibly \"infinitesimal\" and suitably \"regular\" topological spaces. While in C\nthe classes M and M' play the role of discrete fibrations and opfibrations, in\nT they play the role of local homeomorphisms and perfect maps, so that X\\to 1\nis in M (resp.

This notion and its\nstudy are based on a preliminary investigation of cross-effects of functors in\na general categorical context. These also allow us to define higher categorical\ncommutators. We show that any proper subobject of an object $E$ (i.e., a kernel\nof some map on $E$ in $\\mathbb C$) admits a \"conjugation\" action of $E$,\ngeneralizing the conjugation action of $E$ on itself defined by Bourn and\nJanelidze.

        "summary": "  String diagrams are a powerful tool for reasoning about physical processes,\nlogic circuits, tensor networks, and many other compositional structures. The\ndistinguishing feature of these diagrams is that edges need not be connected to\nvertices at both ends, and these unconnected ends can be interpreted as the\ninputs and outputs of a diagram. In this paper, we give a concrete construction\nfor string diagrams using a special kind of typed graph called an open-graph.\nWhile the category of open-graphs is not itself adhesive, we introduce the\nnotion of a selective adhesive functor, and show that such a functor embeds the\ncategory of open-graphs into the ambient adhesive category of typed graphs.\nUsing this functor, the category of open-graphs inherits \"enough adhesivity\"\nfrom the category of typed graphs to perform double-pushout (DPO) graph\nrewriting. A salient feature of our theory is that it ensures rewrite systems\nare \"type-safe\" in the sense that rewriting respects the inputs and outputs.\nThis formalism lets us safely encode the interesting structure of a\ncomputational model, such as evaluation dynamics, with succinct, explicit\nrewrite rules, while the graphical representation absorbs many of the tedious\ndetails. Although topological formalisms exist for string diagrams, our\nconstruction is discreet, finitary, and enjoys decidable algorithms for\ncomposition and rewriting. We also show how open-graphs can be parametrised by\ngraphical signatures, similar to the monoidal signatures of Joyal and Street,\nwhich define types for vertices in the diagrammatic language and constraints on\nhow they can be connected. Using typed open-graphs, we can construct free\nsymmetric monoidal categories, PROPs, and more general monoidal theories. Thus\nopen-graphs give us a handle for mechanised reasoning in monoidal categories.\n",

The\nappropriate exotic derived category of coherent matrix factorizations is then\nidentified with the triangulated category of relative singularities, while the\nsimilar exotic derived category of locally free matrix factorizations is its\nfull subcategory. The latter category is identified with the kernel of the\ndirect image functor corresponding to the closed embedding of the zero locus\nand acting between the conventional (absolute) triangulated categories of\nsingularities.

That is, for any\n2-category K and for any non-negative integer n, we introduce 2-categories\nWdl^{(n)}(K), of (n+1)-tuples of monads in K pairwise related by weak\ndistributive laws obeying the Yang-Baxter equation. The first instance\nWdl^{(0)}(K) coincides with Mnd(K), the usual 2-category of monads in K, and\nfor other values of n, Wdl^{(n)}(K) contains Mnd^{n+1}(K) as a full\n2-subcategory. For the local idempotent closure K^ of K, extending the\nmultiplication of the 2-monad Mnd, we equip these 2-categories with n possible\n`weak wreath product' 2-functors Wdl^{(n)}(K^) --> Wdl^{(n-1)}(K^), such that\nall of their possible n-fold composites Wdl^{(n)}(K^) --> Wdl^{(0)}(K^) are\nequal; i.e. such that the weak wreath product is `associative'. Whenever\nidempotent 2-cells in K split, this leads to pseudofunctors Wdl^{(n)}(K) -->\nWdl^{(n-1)}(K) obeying the associativity property up-to isomorphism. We present\na practically important occurrence of an iterated weak wreath product: the\nalgebra of observable quantities in an Ising type quantum spin chain where the\nspins take their values in a dual pair of finite weak Hopf algebras. We also\nconstruct a fully faithful embedding of Wdl^{(n)}(K^) into the 2-category of\ncommutative n+1 dimensional cubes in Mnd(K^) (hence into the 2-category of\ncommutative n+1 dimensional cubes in K whenever K has Eilenberg-Moore objects\nand its idempotent 2-cells split). Finally we give a sufficient and necessary\ncondition on a monad in K^ to be isomorphic to an n-ary weak wreath product.\n",

Thus,\ngiven a data measurement $\\mu: 1 \\rightarrow D$, a posterior probability\n$\\widehat{P_H}= I \\circ \\mu$ can be computed. This procedure is iterative: with\neach updated probability $P_H$, we obtain a new joint distribution which in\nturn yields a new inference map $I$ and the process repeats with each\nadditional measurement. The main result uses an existence theorem for regular\nconditional probabilities by Faden, which holds in more generality than the\nsetting of Polish spaces. This less stringent setting then allows for\nnon-trivial decision rules (Eilenberg--Moore algebras) on finite (as well as\nnon finite) spaces, and also provides for a common framework for decision\ntheory and Bayesian probability.\n",

We introduce a new type of circuit\nbased instead on determinants, with seemingly different expressive power.

Applications of these circuits include proofs of theorems from algebraic\ngraph theory including the Chung-Langlands formula for the number of rooted\nspanning forests of a graph and computing Tutte Polynomials of certain\nmatroids. They also give a strategy for simulating quantum circuits with closed\ntimelike curves. Monoidal category theory provides a useful language for\ndiscussing such counting problems, turning combinatorial restrictions into\ncategorical properties. We introduce the counting problem in monoidal\ncategories and count-preserving functors as a way to study FP subclasses of\nproblems in settings which are generally #P-hard.

Classical conditional\nprobabilities are expressed as a certain \"triangle-fill-in\" condition,\nconnecting marginal and joint probabilities, in the Kleisli category of the\ndistribution monad. The conditional probabilities are induced by a map together\nwith a predicate (the condition). The latter is a predicate in the logic of\neffect modules on this Kleisli category.\n  This same approach can be transferred to the category of C*-algebras (with\npositive unital maps), whose predicate logic is also expressed in terms of\neffect modules. Conditional probabilities can again be expressed via a\ntriangle-fill-in property. In the literature, there are several proposals for\nwhat quantum conditional probability should be, and also there are extra\ndifficulties not present in the classical case.

Here we\nintroduce Azumaya monads on any category $\\A$ by considering a monad $\\bF$ on\n$\\A$ endowed with a distributive law $\\lambda: FF\\to FF$ satisfying the\nYang-Baxter equation (BD-law). This allows to introduce an {\\em opposite monad}\n$\\bF^\\la$ and a monad structure on $FF^\\la$. For an {\\em Azumaya monad} we\nimpose the condition that the canonical comparison functor induces an\nequivalence between the category $\\A$ and the category of $\\bF\\bF^\\la$-modules.\nProperties and characterisations of these monads are studied, in particular for\nthe case when $F$ allows for a right adjoint functor. Dual to Azumaya monads we\ndefine {\\em Azumaya comonads} and investigate the interplay between these\nnotions.\n  In braided categories $(\\V,\\ot,I,\\tau)$, for any $\\V$-algebra $A$, the\nbraiding induces a BD-law $\\tau_{A,A}:A\\ot A\\to A\\ot A$ and $A$ is called left\n(right) Azumaya, provided the monad $A\\ot-$ (resp. $-\\ot A$) is Azumaya. If\n$\\tau$ is a symmetry, or if the category $\\V$ admits equalisers and\ncoequalisers, the notions of left and right Azumaya algebras coincide. The\ngeneral theory provides the definition of coalgebras in $\\V$. Given a\ncocommutative $\\V$-coalgebra $\\bD$, coalgebras $\\bC$ over $\\bD$ are defined as\ncoalgebras in the monoidal category of $\\bD$-comodules and we describe when\nthese have the Azumaya property.

In good cases, this\nconvolution product does restrict into a well defined convolution product on a\nsubset of the set of continuous functions and defines a convolution C* algebra\nattached to the quantale. In the last part of this article we investigate in\ndetails these attached C* algebras in the special case of an atomic topos. In\nthis situation the related Grothendieck quantale corresponds to a\nhypergroupoid. Relatively simple finiteness conditions on this hypergroupoid\nappear in order to obtain an interesting C* algebra. This algebra corresponds\nto a hypergroupoid algebra which comes endowed with an arithmetic sub-algebra\nand a time evolution. We conclude by showing that the existence of a\nhypergroupoid satisfying all the requirements attached to a specified atomic\ntopos is equivalent to the fact that the topos is locally decidable and locally\nseparated. Also in this situation the time evolution only depends on the topos\nand is described by a (canonical) principal Q+* bundle on the topos.

To this end, this paper introduces the notion of second-order\nalgebraic theory and develops its basic theory. A crucial role in the\ndefinition is played by the second-order theory of equality $\\M$, representing\nthe most elementary operators and equations present in every second-order\nlanguage. The category $\\M$ can be described abstractly via the universal\nproperty of being the free cartesian category on an exponentiable object.\nThereby, in the tradition of categorical algebra, a second-order algebraic\ntheory consists of a cartesian category $\\Mlaw$ and a strict cartesian\nidentity-on-objects functor $\\M \\to \\Mlaw$ that preserves the universal\nexponentiable object of $\\Mlaw$. Lawvere's functorial semantics for algebraic\ntheories can then be generalised to the second-order setting. To verify the\ncorrectness of our theory, two categorical equivalences are established: at the\nsyntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order\nalgebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and\nsecond-order functorial models.\n",

The scheme has many merits, but sacrifices useful type\ninformation in the move to an equational style of reasoning. By contrast,\ntraditional proofs by diagram pasting retain the vital type information, but\npoorly express the reasoning and development of categorical proofs. In order to\ncombine the strengths of these two perspectives, we propose the use of string\ndiagrams, common folklore in the category theory community, allowing us to\nretain the type information whilst pursuing a calculational form of proof.\nThese graphical representations provide a topological perspective on\ncategorical proofs, and silently handle functoriality and naturality conditions\nthat require awkward bookkeeping in more traditional notation.\n  Our approach is to proceed primarily by example, systematically applying\ngraphical techniques to many aspects of category theory. We develop string\ndiagrammatic formulations of many common notions, including adjunctions,\nmonads, Kan extensions, limits and colimits. We describe representable functors\ngraphically, and exploit these as a uniform source of graphical calculation\nrules for many category theoretic concepts. These graphical tools are then used\nto explicitly prove many standard results in our proposed diagrammatic style.\n",

This offers a new approach to bialgebroids and\nHopf algebroids. Little is known about skew monoidal structures on general\ncategories. In the present paper we study the one-object case: skew monoidal\nmonoids (SMM). We show that they possess a dual pair of bialgebroids describing\nthe symmetries of the (co)module categories of the SMM. These bialgebroids are\nsubmonoids of their own base and are rank 1 free over the base on the source\nside. We give various equivalent definitions of SMM, study the structure of\ntheir (co)module categories and discuss the possible closed and Hopf structures\non a SMM.\n",

In this paper we show how it arises in the context of category\ntheory using categories enriched over the extended real numbers $\\overline{\n\\mathbb{R}}:=[-\\infty,+\\infty]$. A key ingredient is Pavlovic's 'nucleus of a\nprofunctor' construction. The pairing between a vector space and its dual can\nbe viewed as an $\\overline {\\mathbb{R}}$-profunctor; the construction of the\nnucleus of this profunctor is the construction of a lot of the theory of the\nLegendre-Fenchel transform. For a relation between sets viewed as a\n$\\{\\mathrm{true},\\mathrm{false}\\}$-valued profunctor, the construction of the\nnucleus is the construction of the Galois connection associated to the\nrelation.\n  One insight given by this approach is that the relevant structure on the\nfunction spaces involved in the Legendre-Fenchel transform is something like a\nmetric but is asymmetric and can take negative values. This '$\\overline\n{\\mathbb{R}}$-structure' is a considerable refinement of the usual partial\norder on real-valued function space and it allows a natural interpretation of\nToland-Singer duality and of the two tropical module structures on the set of\nconvex functions.\n",

For example, the operad of wiring\ndiagrams has 8 generators and 28 generating relations, while the operad of\nundirected wiring diagrams has 6 generators and 17 generating relations. Our\nsecond main objective is to prove a corresponding finite presentation theorem\nfor algebras over each operad of wiring diagrams. As applications we provide\nfinite presentations for the propagator algebra, the algebra of discrete\nsystems, the algebra of open dynamical systems, and the (typed) relational\nalgebra. We also provide a partial verification of Spivak's conjecture\nregarding the quotient-freeness of the relational algebra.

We prove a topos theoretic Green-Julg\ntheorem: The category of Hilbert spaces over a topos which is locally\ndecidable, separated and whose localic reflection is locally compact and\ncompletely regular is a category of Hilbert modules over a C*-algebras attached\nto the topos. All the results in this paper are proved constructively and hence\ncan be applied themselves internally to a topos. Moreover we give constructive\nproof of some known classical results about C*-algebras and Hilbert modules.\n",

Technically, this paper\nintroduces and studies the class of semi-galois categories, which extend galois\ncategories and are dual to profinite monoids in the same way as galois\ncategories are dual to profinite groups; the study on this class of categories\nis aimed at providing an axiomatic reformulation of Eilenberg's theory of\nvarieties of regular languages--- a branch in formal language theory that has\nbeen developed since the mid 1960's and particularly concerns systematic\nclassification of regular languages, finite monoids, and deterministic finite\nautomata. In this paper, detailed proofs of our central results announced at\nLICS'16 are presented, together with topos-theoretic considerations. The main\nresults include (I) a proof of the duality theorem between profinite monoids\nand semi-galois categories, extending the duality theorem between profinite\ngroups and galois categories; based on this results on semi-galois categories,\nwe then discuss (II) a reinterpretation of Eilenberg's theory from a viewpoint\nof duality theorem; in relation with this reinterpretation of the theory, (III)\nwe also give a purely topos-theoretic characterization of classifying topoi BM\nof profinite monoids M among general coherent topoi, which is a topos-theoretic\napplication of (I). This characterization states that a topos E is equivalent\nto the classifying topos BM of some profinite monoid M if and only if E is (i)\ncoherent, (ii) noetherian, and (iii) has a surjective coherent point. This\ntopos-theoretic consideration is related to the logical and geometric problems\nconcerning Eilenberg's theory that we addressed at LICS'16, which remain open\nin this paper.\n",

We propose that such systems are modeled as\ncoalgebras with a finitely generated carrier for an endofunctor on a locally\nfinitely presentable category. Their behaviour gives rise to a new fixpoint of\nthe coalgebraic type functor called locally finite fixpoint (LFF). We prove\nthat if the given endofunctor preserves monomorphisms then the LFF always\nexists and is a subcoalgebra of the final coalgebra (unlike the rational\nfixpoint previously studied by Ad\\'amek, Milius and Velebil). Moreover, we show\nthat the LFF is characterized by two universal properties: 1. as the final\nlocally finitely generated coalgebra, and 2. as the initial fg-iterative\nalgebra. As instances of the LFF we first obtain the known instances of the\nrational fixpoint, e.g. regular languages, rational streams and formal\npower-series, regular trees etc. And we obtain a number of new examples, e.g.\n(realtime deterministic resp. non-deterministic) context-free languages,\nconstructively S-algebraic formal power-series (and any other instance of the\ngeneralized powerset construction by Silva, Bonchi, Bonsangue, and Rutten) and\nthe monad of Courcelle's algebraic trees.\n",

In this thesis we approach affine and\nprojective planes from a constructive point of view and we base our geometry on\nlocal rings instead of fields. We start by constructing projective and affine\nplanes over local rings and establishing forms of Desargues' Theorem and\nPappus' Theorem which hold for these. From this analysis we derive coherent\ntheories of projective and affine planes. The great Greek mathematicians of the\nclassical period used geometry as the basis for their theory of quantities. The\nmodern version of this idea is the reconstruction of algebra from geometry. We\nshow how we can construct a local ring whenever we are given an affine or a\nprojective plane. This enables us to describe the classifying toposes of our\ntheories of affine and projective planes as extensions of the Zariski topos by\ncertain group actions. Through these descriptions of the classifying toposes,\nthe links between the theories of local rings, affine and projective planes\nbecome clear. In particular, the geometric morphisms between these classifying\ntoposes are all induced by group homomorphisms even though they demonstrate\ncomplicated constructions in geometry. In this thesis, we also prove results in\ntopos theory which are applied to these geometric morphisms to give Morita\nequivalences between some further theories.\n",

They provide an\nabstract setting for differential geometry by axiomatizing key aspects of the\nsubject which allow the basic theory of these geometric settings to be\ncaptured. Importantly, they have models not only in classical differential\ngeometry and its extensions, but also in algebraic geometry, combinatorics,\ncomputer science, and physics.\n  This paper develops the theory of \"differential bundles\" for such categories,\nconsiders their relation to \"differential objects\", and develops the theory of\nfibrations of tangent categories. Differential bundles generalize the notion of\nsmooth vector bundles in classical differential geometry. However, the\ndefinition departs from the standard one in several significant ways: in\ngeneral, there is no scalar multiplication in the fibres of these bundles, and\nin general these bundles need not be locally trivial.\n  To understand how these differential bundles relate to differential objects,\nwhich are the generalization of vector spaces in smooth manifolds, requires\nsome careful handling of the behaviour of pullbacks with respect to the tangent\nfunctor. This is captured by \"transverse\" and \"display\" systems for tangent\ncategories, which leads one into the fibrational theory of tangent categories.\nA key example of a tangent fibration is provided by the \"display\" differential\nbundles of a tangent category with a display system. Strikingly, in such\nexamples the fibres are Cartesian differential categories demonstrating a --\nnot unexpected -- tight connection between the theory of these categories and\nthat of tangent categories.\n",

Taking Lawvere's quantale of extended\npositive real numbers as base quantale, $\\Q$-categories are generalised metric\nspaces, and $\\D(\\Q)$-categories are generalised partial metric spaces, i.e.\\\nmetric spaces in which self-distance need not be zero and with a suitably\nmodified triangular inequality.

Control processes are also described by controllability and\nobservability---whether the input can drive the process to any state, and\nwhether any state can be determined from later outputs. For any field k we give\na presentation of FinRel_k in terms of generators of the free PROP of\nsignal-flow diagrams together with the equations that give FinRel_k its\nstructure. The `cap' and `cup' generators, missing when the morphisms are\nlinear maps, make it possible to model feedback. The relations say, among other\nthings, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative\ndagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either\none and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a\nbimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum,\nis familiar from the `ZX-calculus' obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space\nwith two mutually unbiased bases. In order to address controllability and\nobservability, we construct the PROP Stateful_k and relate it back to the PROP\nof signal-flow diagrams.

We present constructions of computads, all with clear\nanalogues in standard topology, that capture in great generality such notions\nas homomorphisms and actions, and the interactions of monoids and comonoids\nthat lead to the theory of Frobenius algebras and of bialgebras.

Moreover, we show that the idempotents of the join of maps are\nprecisely the embeddings, and we prove the `join connectivity theorem', which\nstates that the connectivity of the join of maps equals the join of the\nconnectivities of the individual maps.\n  We define the image of a map $f:A\\to X$ in $U$ via the join construction, as\nthe colimit of the finite join powers of $f$. The join powers therefore provide\napproximations of the image inclusion, and the join connectivity theorem\nimplies that the approximating maps into the image increase in connectivity.\n  A modified version of the join construction can be used to show that for any\nmap $f:A\\to X$ in which $X$ is only assumed to be locally small, the image is a\nsmall type. We use the modified join construction to give an alternative\nconstruction of set-quotients, the Rezk completion of a precategory, and we\ndefine the $n$-truncation for any $n:\\mathbb{N}$.

This encapsulates a common way\nof building categories in practice, by starting with an existing category and\nadding extra data/properties to the objects and morphisms.\n  The interest of this seemingly trivial reformulation is that various\nproperties of functors are more naturally defined as properties of the\ncorresponding displayed categories. Grothendieck fibrations, for example, when\ndefined as certain functors, use equality on objects in their definition. When\ndefined instead as certain displayed categories, no reference to equality on\nobjects is required. Moreover, almost all examples of fibrations in nature are,\nin fact, categories whose standard construction can be seen as going via\ndisplayed categories.\n  We therefore propose displayed categories as a basis for the development of\nfibrations in the type-theoretic setting, and similarly for various other\nnotions whose classical definitions involve equality on objects.\n  Besides giving a conceptual clarification of such issues, displayed\ncategories also provide a powerful tool in computer formalisation, unifying and\nabstracting common constructions and proof techniques of category theory, and\nenabling modular reasoning about categories of multi-component structures. As\nsuch, most of the material of this article has been formalised in Coq over the\nUniMath library, with the aim of providing a practical library for use in\nfurther developments.\n",

We define\nRezk types, in which the categorical isomorphisms are additionally equivalent\nto the type-theoretic identities - a \"local univalence\" condition. And we\ndefine covariant fibrations, which are type families varying functorially over\na Segal type, and prove a \"dependent Yoneda lemma\" that can be viewed as a\ndirected form of the usual elimination rule for identity types. We conclude by\nstudying homotopically correct adjunctions between Segal types, and showing\nthat for a functor between Rezk types to have an adjoint is a mere proposition.\n  To make the bookkeeping in such proofs manageable, we use a three-layered\ntype theory with shapes, whose contexts are extended by polytopes within\ndirected cubes, which can be abstracted over using \"extension types\" that\ngeneralize the path-types of cubical type theory. In an appendix, we describe\nthe motivating semantics in the Reedy model structure on bisimplicial sets, in\nwhich our Segal and Rezk types correspond to Segal spaces and complete Segal\nspaces.\n",

The relationship between such functors is \"indeterminate natural\ntransformation\", the central notion in TINT, which models the creation of\nmeanings in a precise manner.

A\nquantum category is an opmonoidal monad on an enveloping monoidale\n$R^\\circ\\otimes R$ in a monoidal bicategory. In a previous paper, we\ncharacterised opmonoidal arrows on enveloping monoidales as a simpler structure\ncalled oplax action.\n  This is the second paper based on the author's PhD thesis.

To do so, we arrange oplax actions as the\n1-simplices of a simplicial object in $\\mathsf{Cat}$. In nice cases this\nsimplicial object is ought to be thought as a bicategory whose arrows are oplax\nactions, that is to say, it is weakly equivalent to a nerve of a bicategory.

Indeed, a hypergraph category is,\nroughly speaking, a \"symmetric monoidal category in which each object is\nequipped with the structure of a special commutative Frobenius monoid,\nsatisfying certain coherence conditions\".\n  Fortunately, this description can be simplified a great deal: a hypergraph\ncategory is simply a \"cospan-algebra\".

First is a coherence theorem for hypergraph categories, which says\nthat every hypergraph category is equivalent to an objectwise-free hypergraph\ncategory.

For us an \"open\" Petri net is one with certain places designated as\ninputs and outputs via a cospan of sets. We can compose open Petri nets by\ngluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Open Petri nets can be\ntreated as morphisms of a category $\\mathsf{Open}(\\mathsf{Petri})$, which\nbecomes symmetric monoidal under disjoint union. However, since the composite\nof open Petri nets is defined only up to isomorphism, it is better to treat\nthem as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal double category\n$\\mathbb{O}\\mathbf{pen}(\\mathsf{Petri})$. We describe two forms of semantics\nfor open Petri nets using symmetric monoidal double functors out of\n$\\mathbb{O}\\mathbf{pen}(\\mathsf{Petri})$.

Extending the classical observation\nthat computational effects can be modeled by monads, these computational\neffects with parameters are modeled by various mathematical structures\nincluding graded monads and indexed monads, which are two different\ngeneralizations of ordinary monads. The former has been employed in the\nsemantics of effect systems, whereas the latter in the study of the\nrelationship between the local state monads and the global state monads, each\nexemplifying the two situations mentioned above.

The key notion is that of a curve\nobject which is, for differential geometry, the structural analogue of a\nnatural number object. A curve object is a preinitial object for dynamical\nsystems; dynamical systems may, in turn, be viewed as determining systems of\ndifferential equations. The unique map from the curve object to a dynamical\nsystem is a solution of the system, and a dynamical system is said to be\ncomplete when for all initial conditions there is a solution. A subtle issue\nconcerns the question of when a dynamical system is complete, and the paper\nprovides abstract conditions for this.\n  This abstract formulation also allows new perspectives on topics such as\ncommutative vector fields and flows. In addition, the stronger notion of a\ndifferential curve object, which is the centrepiece of the last section of the\npaper, has exponential maps and forms a differential exponential rig. This rig\nthen, somewhat surprisingly, has an action on every differential object and\nbundle in the setting. In this manner, in a very strong sense, such a curve\nobject plays the role of the real numbers in standard differential geometry.\n",

In this framework, dealing with\ndeterministic and increasing operators, a dilation (respectively an erosion) is\nan operation which is distributive over supremum (respectively infimum). From\nthis simple definition of dilation and erosion, we cannot say much about the\nproperties of them. However, when they form an adjunction, many important\nproperties can be derived such as monotonicity, idempotence, and extensivity or\nanti-extensivity of their composition, preservation of infimum and supremum,\netc. Mathematical morphology has been first developed in the setting of sets,\nand then extended to other algebraic structures such as graphs, hypergraphs or\nsimplicial complexes. For all these algebraic structures, erosion and dilation\nare usually based on structuring elements. The goal is then to match these\nstructuring elements on given objects either to dilate or erode them. One of\nthe advantages of defining erosion and dilation based on structuring elements\nis that these operations are adjoint. Based on this observation, this paper\nproposes to define, at the abstract level of category theory, erosion and\ndilation based on structuring elements. We then define the notion of\nmorpho-category on which erosion and dilation are defined. We then show that\ntopos and more precisely topos of presheaves are good candidates to generate\nmorpho-categories. However, topos do not allow taking into account the notion\nof inclusion between substructures but rather are defined by monics up to\ndomain isomorphism. Therefore we define the notion of morpholizable category\nwhich allows generating morpho-categories where substructures are defined along\ninclusion morphisms. {A direct application of this framework is to generalize\nmodal morpho-logic to other algebraic structures than simple sets.\n",

This notion was called \"mode dependence\", and while the framework was\ncompositional (forming an operad of re-wiring diagrams and algebra of\nmode-dependent dynamical systems on it), the formulation itself was more\n\"creative\" than it was natural.\n  In this paper we show that the theory of mode-dependent dynamical systems can\nbe more naturally recast within the category Poly of polynomial functors. This\ncategory is almost superlatively abundant in its structure: for example, it has\n\\emph{four} interacting monoidal structures $(+,\\times,\\otimes,\\circ)$, two of\nwhich ($\\times,\\otimes$) are monoidal closed, and the comonoids for $\\circ$ are\nprecisely categories in the usual sense. We discuss how the various structures\nin Poly show up in the theory of dynamical systems. We also show that the usual\ncoalgebraic formalism for dynamical systems takes place within Poly.

But many changing\nsituations in the world cannot be meaningfully isolated from their environment\n- a cell will die if it is removed from everything beyond its walls. To study\nsystems that interact with their environment, and to design such systems in a\nmodular way, we need a robust theory of open dynamical systems.\n  In this extended abstract, we put forward a general definition of open\ndynamical system. We define two general sorts of morphisms between these\nsystems: covariant morphisms which include trajectories, steady states, and\nperiodic orbits; and contravariant morphisms which allow for plugging variables\nof some systems into parameters of other systems. We define an indexed double\ncategory of open dynamical systems indexed by their interface and use a double\nGrothendieck construction to construct a double category of open dynamical\nsystems.\n  In our main theorem, we construct covariantly representable indexed double\nfunctors from the indexed double category of dynamical systems to an indexed\ndouble category of spans.

Cartesian closed\nbicategories---2-categories `up to isomorphism' equipped with similarly weak\nproducts and exponentials---arise in logic, categorical algebra, and game\nsemantics. I show that there is at most one 2-cell between any parallel pair of\n1-cells in the free cartesian closed bicategory on a set and hence---in terms\nof the difficulty of calculating---bring the data of cartesian closed\nbicategories down to the familiar level of cartesian closed categories.\n  In fact, I prove this result in two ways. The first argument is closely\nrelated to Power's coherence theorem for bicategories with flexible bilimits.\nFor the second, which is the central preoccupation of this thesis, the proof\nstrategy has two parts: the construction of a type theory, and the proof that\nit satisfies a form of normalisation I call \"local coherence\". I synthesise the\ntype theory from algebraic principles using a novel generalisation of the\n(multisorted) abstract clones of universal algebra, called \"biclones\". Using a\nbicategorical treatment of M. Fiore's categorical analysis of\nnormalisation-by-evaluation, I then prove a normalisation result which entails\nthe coherence theorem for cartesian closed bicategories. In contrast to\nprevious coherence results for bicategories, the argument does not rely on the\ntheory of rewriting or strictify using the Yoneda embedding. Along the way I\nprove bicategorical generalisations of a series of well-established\ncategory-theoretic results, present a notion of glueing of bicategories, and\nbicategorify the folklore result providing sufficient conditions for a glueing\ncategory to be cartesian closed.\n",

The original interpretation in an individual lcc category can then be\nrecovered by slicing. As in the original interpretation, we face the issue of\ncoherence: Categorical structure is usually preserved by functors only up to\nisomorphism, whereas syntactic substitution commutes strictly with all type\ntheoretic structure. Our solution involves a suitable presentation of the\nhigher category of lcc categories as model category. To that end, we construct\na model category of lcc sketches, from which we obtain by the formalism of\nalgebraically (co)fibrant objects model categories of strict lcc categories and\nthen algebraically cofibrant strict lcc categories.

In [PS], we constructed a closed model structure on the category of\nweakly unital dg categories, imposing a technical condition on the weakly\nunital dg categories, saying that $\\mathrm{id}_x\\cdot\n\\mathrm{id}_x=\\mathrm{id}_x$ for any object $x$. Although this condition led us\nto a great simplification, it was redundant and had to be dropped.\n  Here we get rid of this condition, and provide a closed model structure in\nfull generality. The new closed model category is as well cofibrantly\ngenerated, and it is proven to be Quillen equivalent to the closed model\ncategory $\\mathrm{Cat}_\\mathrm{dg}(\\Bbbk)$ of (strictly unital) dg categories\nover $\\Bbbk$, given by Tabuada [Tab1]. Dropping the condition\n$\\mathrm{id}_x^2=\\mathrm{id}_x$ makes the construction of the closed model\nstructure more distant from loc.cit., and requires new constructions. One of\nthem is a pre-triangulated hull of a wu dg category, which in turn is shown to\nbe a wu dg category as well.\n  One example of a weakly unital dg category which naturally appears is the\nbar-cobar resolution of a dg category. We supply this paper with a refinement\nof the classical bar-cobar resolution of a unital dg category which is strictly\nunital (appendix B). A similar construction can be applied to constructing a\ncofibrant resolution in $\\mathrm{Cat}_\\mathrm{dgwu}(\\Bbbk)$.\n",

However, in the aforementioned work the authors used\ntechniques from Goodwillie's functor calculus to establish a linearization\nprocess from which they then derived a differential combinator. This raised the\nquestion of what the precise relationship between linearization and having a\ndifferential combinator might be.\n  In this paper, we introduce the notion of a linearizing combinator which\nabstracts linearization in the Abelian functor calculus. We then use it to\nprovide an alternative axiomatization of a Cartesian differential category.\nEvery Cartesian differential category comes equipped with a canonical\nlinearizing combinator obtained by differentiation at zero. Conversely, a\ndifferential combinator can be constructed \\`a la BJORT when one has a system\nof partial linearizing combinators in each context. Thus, while linearizing\ncombinators do provide an alternative axiomatization of Cartesian differential\ncategories, an explicit notion of partial linearization is required. This is in\ncontrast to the situation for differential combinators where partial\ndifferentiation is automatic in the presence of total differentiation.

We show that, when there are enough projectives or enough\ninjectives, thus defined extensions agree with the ones defined earlier via\nprojective or injective resolutions. For categories with enough projective or\nenough injective morphisms, we prove that these are right derived functors of\nthe $\\operatorname{Hom}$-bifunctor in either argument.\n  Since $\\operatorname{Hom}$ is only half-exact in each argument, it is natural\nto expect \"negative extensions\", i.e. its left derived functors, to exist and\nnot necessarily vanish. We define negative extensions with respect to the first\nand to the second argument and show that they give rise to universal\n$\\delta$-functors, when there are enough projective or injective morphisms,\nrespectively. In general, they are not balanced. However, for topological\nextriangulated categories, the existence of a balanced version of negative\nextensions follows from combining the work of Klemenc on exact\n$\\infty$-categories with results of the second and third authors. We discuss\nvarious criteria under which one has the balance of the above bifunctors on the\nfunctorial or on the numerical levels. This happens, in particular, in the\ncases of exact or triangulated categories, and also in the case of the category\nof $n$-term complexes with projective components over a finite-dimensional\nalgebra.\n  Given a connected sequence of functors on an extriangulated category\n$(\\mathcal{C},\\mathbb{E},\\mathfrak{s})$, we determine the maximal relative\nextriangulated structure, with respect to which the sequence is a\n$\\delta$-functor. We also find several equivalent criteria for the existence of\nenough projective or injective morphisms in a given extriangulated category.\n",

Following our previous work on G\\\"odel fibrations, we\npresent a (hyper)doctrine characterisation of the Dialectica which corresponds\nexactly to the logical description of the interpretation. To show that we\nderive in the category theory the soundness of the interpretation of the\nimplication connective, as expounded on by Spector and Troelstra. This requires\nextra logical principles, going beyond intuitionistic logic, Markov's Principle\n(MP) and the Independence of Premise (IP) principle, as well as some choice. We\nshow how these principles are satisfied in the categorical setting,\nestablishing a tight (internal language) correspondence between the logical\nsystem and the categorical framework. This tight correspondence should come\nhandy not only when discussing the applications of the Dialectica already\nknown, like its use to extract computational content from (some) classical\ntheorems (proof mining), its use to help to model specific abstract machines,\netc. but also to help devise new applications.\n",

After providing a characterization of\ngeneralized existential completions, we observe that both the subobjects\ndoctrine $\\mathrm{Sub}_{C}$ and the weak subobjects doctrine\n$\\Psi_{\\mathcal{C}}$ of a category $\\mathcal{C}$ with finite limits are\ngeneralized existential completions of the constant true doctrine, the first\nalong the class of all the monomorphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$ while the latter\nalong all the morphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$. We then name full existential\ncompletion a generalized completion of a conjunctive doctrine along the class\nof all the morphisms of its base. From this we immediately deduce that both the\nregular and the exact completion of a finite limit category are regular and\nexact completions of full existential doctrines since it is known that both the\nregular completion $(\\mathcal{D})_{ reg / lex}$ and the exact completion\n$(\\mathcal{D})_{ex / lex}$ of a finite limit category $\\mathcal{D}$ are\nrespectively the regular completion $\\mathrm{Reg}(\\Psi_{\\mathcal{D}})$ and the\nexact completion $\\mathcal{T}_{\\Psi_{\\mathcal{D}}}$ (as an instance of the\ntripos-to-topos construction) of the weak subobjects doctrine\n$\\Psi_{\\mathcal{D}}$ of $\\mathcal{D}$. Here we prove that the condition of\nbeing a generic full existential completion is also sufficient to produce a\nregular/exact completion equivalent to a regular/exact completion of a finite\nlimit category. Then, we show more specialized characterizations from which we\nderive known results as well as remarkable examples of exact completions of\nfull existential completions, including all realizability toposes and\nsupercoherent localic toposes.\n",

There is growing interest\nin generic approaches to behavioural distances.

Coalgebraic behavioural distances have been\nbased either on liftings of SET-functors to categories of metric spaces, or on\nlax extensions of SET-functors to categories of quantitative relations. Every\nlax extension induces a functor lifting but not every lifting comes from a lax\nextension. It was shown recently that every lax extension is Kantorovich, i.e.\ninduced by a suitable choice of monotone predicate liftings, implying via a\nquantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorem that behavioural distances\ninduced by lax extensions can be characterized by quantitative modal logics.\nHere, we essentially show the same in the more general setting of behavioural\ndistances induced by functor liftings. In particular, we show that every\nfunctor lifting, and indeed every functor on (quantale-valued) metric spaces,\nthat preserves isometries is Kantorovich, so that the induced behavioural\ndistance (on systems of suitably restricted branching degree) can be\ncharacterized by a quantitative modal logic.\n",

The focal point of the enrichment\ntheory shifts, in the oplax case, from the notion of $V$-category (given by\ncollections of objects and hom-objects together with composition and unit maps)\nto the one of categories enriched over $V$ (genuine categories equipped with\nadditional structures). One of the merits of the notion of categories enriched\nover $V$ is that it becomes straightforward to define enriched functors and\nnatural transformations. We show moreover that the resulting 2-category\n$\\mathsf{Cat}_V$ can be put in correspondence (via the theory of distributors)\nwith the 2-category of modules over $V$. We give an example of such an enriched\ncategory in the framework of operads: every cocomplete symmetric monoidal\ncategory $C$ is enriched over the category of sequences in $C$ endowed with an\noplax monoidal structure stemming from the usual operadic composition product,\nwhose monoids are still the operads.

However, the Yoneda embedding does not preserve coproducts. It is\nperhaps less well-known that if we restrict the codomain of the Yoneda\nembedding to the full subcategory of limit-preserving functors, then this\nembedding preserves colimits, while still enjoying most of the other useful\nproperties of the Yoneda embedding. We call this modified embedding the Lambek\nembedding. The category of limit-preserving functors is known to be a\nreflective subcategory of the category of all functors, i.e., there is a left\nadjoint for the inclusion functor. In the literature, the existence of this\nleft adjoint is often proved non-constructively, e.g., by an application of\nFreyd's adjoint functor theorem. In this paper, we provide an alternative, more\nconstructive proof of this fact. We first explain the Lambek embedding and why\nit preserves coproducts. Then we review some concepts from multi-sorted\nalgebras and observe that there is a one-to-one correspondence between\nproduct-preserving presheaves and certain multi-sorted term algebras. We\nprovide a construction that freely turns any presheaf functor into a\nproduct-preserving one, hence giving an explicit definition of the left adjoint\nfunctor of the inclusion.

In recent years, several proof-theoretic\ntransformations, based on G\\\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, have been used\nsystematically to extract new content from classical proofs, following a\nsuggestion of Kreisel. Thus, the interpretation has found new relevant\napplications in several areas of mathematics and computer science. Several\nauthors have explained the Dialectica interpretation in categorical terms. In\nour previous work, we introduced an intrinsic categorical presentation of the\nDialectica construction via a generalisation of Hofstra's work, using the\nnotion of G\\\"odel fibration and its proof-irrelevant version, a G\\\"odel\ndoctrine. The key idea is that G\\\"odel fibrations can be thought of as\nfibrations generated by some basic elements playing the role of quantifier-free\nelements. This categorification of quantifier-free elements is crucial not only\nto show that our notion of G\\\"odel fibration is equivalent to Hofstra's\nDialectica fibration in the appropriate way, but also to show how G\\\"odel\ndoctrines embody the main logical features of the Dialectica Interpretation. To\nshow that, we derive the soundness of the interpretation of the implication\nconnective, as expounded by Troelstra, in the categorical model. This requires\nextra logical principles, going beyond intuitionistic logic, namely Markov\nPrinciple and the Independence of Premise principle, as well as some choice. We\nshow how these principles are satisfied in the categorical setting,\nestablishing a tight correspondence between the logical system and the\ncategorical framework. Finally, to complete our analysis, we characterise\ncategories obtained as results of the tripos-to-topos of Hyland, Johnstone and\nPitts applied to G\\\"odel doctrines.\n",

In this\npaper, we show that value improvement, one of the main steps of dynamic\nprogramming, can be naturally seen as composition in a category of optics, and\nintuitively, the optimal value function is the limit of a chain of optic\ncompositions. We illustrate this with three classic examples: the gridworld,\nthe inverted pendulum and the savings problem.

Promonoidal categories generalise monoidal categories by\nreplacing the functors normally used to form joint systems with profunctors.\nIntuitively, this allows the formation of joint systems which may not always\ngive a system again, but instead a generalised system given by a presheaf. This\nextra freedom gives a new, richer notion of joint systems that can be applied\nto categorical formulations of spacetime. Whereas previous formulations have\nrelied on partial monoidal structure that is only defined on pairs of\nindependent (i.e. spacelike separated) systems, here we give a concrete\nformulation of spacetime where the notion of a joint system is defined for any\npair of systems as a presheaf. The representable presheaves correspond\nprecisely to those actual systems that arise from combining spacelike systems,\nwhereas more general presheaves correspond to virtual systems which inherit\nsome of the logical/compositional properties of their ``actual'' counterparts.\nWe show that there are two ways of doing this, corresponding roughly to\nrelativistic versions of conjunction and disjunction. The former endows the\ncategory of spacetime slices in a Lorentzian manifold with a promonoidal\nstructure, whereas the latter augments this structure with an (even more)\ngeneralised way to combine systems that fails the interchange law.\n",

We identify operational differences between denotationally\nisomorphic categories of cartesian optics and lenses: their different\ncomposition rule and corresponding space-time tradeoffs, positioning them at\ntwo opposite ends of a spectrum. With these motivations we lift the existing\ncategorical constructions and their relationships to the 2-categorical level,\nshowing that the relevant operational concerns become visible.

We show that many standard properties of CFGs can be formulated\nwithin this framework, and that usual closure properties of CF languages\ngeneralize to CF languages of arrows. We also discuss a dual fibrational\nperspective on the functor $p$ via the notion of \"displayed\" operad,\ncorresponding to a lax functor of operads $W[C] \\to Span(Set)$.\n  We then turn to the Chomsky-Sch\\\"utzenberger Representation Theorem. We\ndescribe how a non-deterministic finite state automaton can be seen as a\ncategory $Q$ equipped with a pair of objects denoting initial and accepting\nstates and a functor of categories $Q \\to C$ satisfying the unique lifting of\nfactorizations property and the finite fiber property. Then, we explain how to\nextend this notion of automaton to functors of operads, which generalize tree\nautomata, allowing us to lift an automaton over a category to an automaton over\nits operad of spliced arrows. We show that every CFG over a category can be\npulled back along a ND finite state automaton over the same category, and hence\nthat CF languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. The\nlast important ingredient is the identification of a left adjoint $C[-] :\nOperad \\to Cat$ to the operad of spliced arrows functor, building the \"contour\ncategory\" of an operad. Using this, we generalize the C-S representation\ntheorem, proving that any context-free language of arrows over a category $C$\nis the functorial image of the intersection of a $C$-chromatic tree contour\nlanguage and a regular language.\n",

The existing frameworks of CQM are\ncategorical proof theories of compact dagger linear logic, and are motivated by\nthe interpretation of quantum systems in the category of finite dimensional\nHilbert spaces. This thesis describes a new non-compact framework called Mixed\nUnitary Categories which can accommodate infinite dimensional systems, and\ndevelops models for the framework. To this end, it builds on linearly\ndistributive categories, and $*$-autonomous categories which are categorical\nproof theories of (non-compact) multiplicative linear logic. The proof theory\nof non-compact dagger-linear logic is obtained from the basic setting of an LDC\nby adding a dagger functor satisfying appropriate coherences to give a\ndagger-LDC. From every (isomix) dagger-LDC one can extract a canonical \"unitary\ncore\" which up to equivalence is the traditional CQM framework of\ndagger-monoidal categories. This leads to the framework of Mixed Unitary\nCategories (MUCs): every MUC contains a (compact) unitary core which is\nextended by a (non-compact) isomix dagger-LDC. Various models of MUCs based on\nFiniteness Spaces, Chu spaces, Hopf modules, etc., are developed in this\nthesis. This thesis also generalizes the key algebraic structures of CQM, such\nas observables, measurement, and complementarity, to MUC framework.\nFurthermore, using the MUC framework, this thesis establishes a connection\nbetween the complementary observables of quantum mechanics and the exponential\nmodalities of linear logic.\n",

Thus the definition of stability\n``each type is definable'' says that {a first order theory is stable iff its\nspace of types is simplicially contractible}, in the precise sense that the\nsimplicial type space functor $\\mathbb{S}^T_\\bullet(B):\\Delta^{op}\\to {\\rm\nTop}$, $n\\longmapsto \\mathbb{S}_{n+1}(B)$ fits into a certain well-known\nsimplicial diagram in the category of simplicial topological spaces which does\ndefine contractibility for fibrant simplicial sets. In this note we spell out\nthis and similar diagrams representing notions in model theory such as a\nparameter set and a type, a type being invariant, definable, and product of\ninvariant types, and give pointers to the same diagrams in homotopy theory.\n",

We study the suitability of a fibred generalisation of\nthe ideal completion of a preorder to act as a completion for doctrines to the\nsyntax of geometric logic. In contrast to other completions of doctrines\nconsidered in the literature, our completion takes a Grothendieck topology as a\nsecond argument. As a result, the geometric completion is idempotent, as well\nas being `semantically invariant' for any doctrine whose models can be\nexpressed as a category of continuous flat functors, encompassing a wide class\nof the most commonly considered doctrines.\n  We also relate the geometric completion to other completions of doctrines\nconsidered in the literature: first, by studying the behaviour of the geometric\ncompletion when the second argument is omitted, and then by studying the\ninteraction with those completions of doctrines that complete to a fragment of\ngeometric logic. Throughout, we reference how these completions of doctrines\nyield completions of categories via the syntactic category construction.

We show how\nto use this theory to lift models of logic to more refined ones. In particular,\nwe illustrate it by lifting the compact closed structure of the category of\nfinite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps to the (non-compact)\n$\\ast$-autonomous structure of the category of finite dimensional Banach spaces\nand contractive maps by passing to their respective polycategories. We also\ngive an operational reading of this example, where polylinear maps correspond\nto operations between systems that can act on their inputs and whose outputs\ncan be measured/probed and where norms correspond to properties of the systems\nthat are preserved by the operations.\n  Finally, we recall the B\\'enabou-Grothendieck correspondence linking\nfibrations to indexed categories.

E.g., the categories $Vec$ and $sVec$ of (super)vector spaces are\nincompressible. Moreover, by Deligne's theorem, if char$(k)=0$ then any tensor\ncategory of moderate growth uniquely fibres over $sVec$, so $Vec$ and $sVec$\nare the only incompressible categories in this class.\n  Similarly, in characteristic $p>0$, we have the incompressible Verlinde\ncategory $Ver_p$, and any Frobenius exact category of moderate growth uniquely\nfibres over $Ver_p$. More generally, the Verlinde categories $Ver_{p^n}$,\n$Ver_{p^n}^+$ are incompressible, and a key conjecture is that every tensor\ncategory of moderate growth uniquely fibres over $Ver_{p^\\infty}$. This would\nmake the above the only incompressible categories in this class.\n  We prove a part of this conjecture, showing that every tensor category of\nmoderate growth fibres over an incompressible one. So it remains to understand\nincompressible categories. We say that $\\mathcal D$ is subterminal if it every\ntensor category admits at most one fibre functor to it, and a Bezrukavnikov\ncategory if the class of tensor categories that fibre over $\\mathcal D$ is\nclosed under quotients. Clearly, a subterminal Bezrukavnikov category is\nincompressible, and we conjecture the converse. We prove that $Ver_p$ is\nBezrukavnikov, generalizing the result of Bezrukavnikov for $Vec$.\n  We also find intrinsic sufficient conditions for incompressibility and\nsubterminality. Namely, $\\mathcal D$ is maximally nilpotent if the growth rates\nof symmetric powers are minimal. We show that a finite maximally nilpotent\ncategory is incompressible, and also subterminal if it satisfies an additional\ngeometric reductivity condition. Then we verify these conditions for\n$Ver_{2^n}$.\n",

An octonionic para-linear map f is in general not octonionic linear\nsince it subjects to the rule Re (f (px)-pf (x))= 0. The composition should be\nmodified so that it preserves the octonionic para-linearity. In this\nnon-associative category, we introduce the Hom and Tensor functors which\nconstitute an adjoint pair. We establish the Yoneda lemma in terms of the new\nnotion of weak functor. To define the exactness in a non-associative category,\nwe introduce the notion of the enveloping category via a universal property.\nThis allows us to establish the exactness of the Hom functor and Tensor\nfunctor.\n",

Double categories are a natural\ngeneralization of categories which incorporate the data of two separate classes\nof morphisms, allowing a more nuanced representation of relationships and\ninteractions between objects.

By focusing on the role played by\ncategories of elements in such a context, we reformulate previous definitions\nof transformational networks in a $\\mathbf{Cat}$-based diagrammatical\nperspective, and present a new definition of transformational networks (called\nCT-Nets) in general musical categories. We show incidently how such an approach\nprovides a bridge between algebraic, geometrical and graph-theoretical\napproaches in transformational music analysis. We end with a discussion on the\nnew perspectives opened by such a formalization of transformational theory, in\nparticular with respect to $\\mathbf{Rel}$-based transformational networks which\noccur in well-known music-theoretical constructions such as Douthett's and\nSteinbach's Cube Dance.\n",

This simplicial structure is represented inside the\ntheory by a primitive notion of display or dependency, guarded by modalities,\nyielding a partially-internal form of unary parametricity.\n  Using the display primitive, we then give a coinductive definition, at the\nsimplicial mode, of a type $\\mathsf{SST}$ of semi-simplicial types. Roughly\nspeaking, a semi-simplicial type $X$ consists of a type $X_0$ together with,\nfor each $x:X_0$, a displayed semi-simplicial type over $X$. This mimics how\nsimplices can be generated geometrically through repeated cones, and is made\npossible by the display primitive at the simplicial mode. The discrete part of\n$\\mathsf{SST}$ then yields the usual infinite indexed definition of\nsemi-simplicial types, both semantically and syntactically.

Narratives are sheaves\non posets of intervals of time which specify snapshots of a temporal object as\nwell as relationships between snapshots over the course of any given interval\nof time. This approach offers two significant advantages. First, when\nrestricted to the base category of graphs, the theory is consistent with the\nwell-established theory of temporal graphs, enabling the reproduction of\nresults in this field. Second, the theory is general enough to extend results\nto a wide range of categories used in data analysis, such as groups,\ntopological spaces, databases, Petri nets, simplicial complexes and many more.\nThe approach overcomes the challenge of relating narratives of different types\nto each other and preserves the structure over time in a compositional sense.\nFurthermore our approach allows for the systematic relation of different kinds\nof narratives. In summary, this theory provides a consistent and general\nframework for analyzing dynamic systems, offering an essential tool for\nmathematicians and data scientists alike.\n",

The enrichment we use is\nin topological spaces, with their canonical closed monoidal structure, which\nencodes a version of pointwise convergence.\n  We work in a topologically enriched dagger category of probability spaces and\nMarkov kernels up to almost sure equality. In this category we can describe\nconditional expectations exactly as dagger-split idempotent morphisms, and\nfiltrations can be encoded as directed nets of split idempotents, with their\ncanonical partial order structure. As we show, every increasing (or decreasing)\nnet of idempotents tends topologically to its supremum (or infimum).\n  Random variables on a probability space form contravariant functors into\ncategories of Hilbert and Banach spaces, which we can enrich topologically\nusing the L^p norms. Martingales and backward martingales can be defined in\nterms of these functors. Since enriched functors preserve convergence of nets,\nwe obtain convergence in the L^p norms. The convergence result for backward\nmartingales indexed by an arbitrary net, in particular, seems to be new.\n  By changing the functor, one can describe more general notions of conditional\nexpectations and martingales, and if the functor is enriched, one automatically\nobtains a convergence result. For instance, one can recover the Bochner-based\nnotion of vector-valued conditional expectation, and the convergence of\nmartingales with values in an arbitrary Banach space.\n  This work seems to be the first application of topologically enriched\ncategories to analysis and probability in the literature. We hope that this\nenrichment, so often overlooked in the past, will be used in the future to\nobtain further convergence results categorically.\n",

To this end, we introduce the notions of natural display\ntopos and natural Cartesian display comonad, and show that the natural model of\ncoalgebras for a natural Cartesian display comonad on a natural display topos\nis again a natural display topos. As an application, this result extends the\napproach to universes of Hofmann and Streicher (1997) from presheaf toposes to\nsheaf toposes with enough points.\n  Whereas natural display toposes provide a categorical semantics for a form of\nextensional Martin-L\\\"of type theory, we also prove our main result in the more\ngeneral setting of natural typoses, which encompasses models of intensional\nMartin-L\\\"of type theory.\n  A natural Cartesian display comonad on a natural typos may also be used as a\nmodel for dependent type theory with an S4 box operator, or comonadic modality,\nas introduced by Nanevski et al.

We sketch an interpretation within this approach.\n  As part of the framework in which the above takes place, we introduce a\nrefinement of the notion of natural model (see Awodey, 2018), which is\n(strictly 2-)equivalent to the notion of full, split comprehension category\n(see Jacobs, 1993), rather than the notion of category with attributes\n(Cartmell 1978).\n",

We also consider when the fixpoint operator is a Conway\noperator, or when the underlying category is closed. As an application, we show\nhow this framework is a suitable setting to formalize the Newton-Raphson\noptimization for fast approximation of fixpoints and extend it to higher order\nlanguages.\n",

Referring to the duality of, say, points and lines in projective\ngeometry, he named the binary relations as polarities.\n  Researchers since then have used polarities (also known as formal contexts)\nas a convenient technical way to build complete lattices from ``found'' data.\nAnd so, various proposals for suitable morphisms between polarities have tended\nto have a particular application in mind.\n  In this work, we develop the structure of a category of polarities and\ncompatible relations, adopting Birkhoff's original simple idea that the\nstructure of a polarity is its the Galois connection. Hence, morphisms must be\nrelations that, in a reasonable sense, preserve Galois connections. In\nparticular, the dual equivalence of the category to the category of complete\nmeet semilattices, completeness of the category, characterization of\nepimorphisms and monomorphisms, an epi/mono factorization system, as well as\nthe star-autonomous structure of the category, all arise by extending\nBirkhoff's original observation to morphisms.\n",

Such defects have been realized physically by\nhalf-space gauging in theories with 1-form symmetries $A[1]$ for an abelian\ngroup $A$, and have found applications in the continuum and the lattice. These\nfusion 3-categories will be called (generalized) Tambara-Yamagami fusion\n3-categories $(\\mathbf{3TY})$. We consider the Brauer-Picard and Picard\n4-groupoids to construct these categories using a 3-categorical version of the\nextension theory introduced by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. These two\n4-groupoids correspond to the construction of duality defects either directly\nin 4d, or from the 5d Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). The Witt\ngroup of non-degenerate braided fusion 1-categories naturally appears in the\naforementioned 4-groupoids and represents enrichments of standard duality\ndefects by (2+1)d TFTs. Our main objective is to study graded extensions of the\nfusion 3-category $\\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$. Firstly, we use invertible bimodule\n3-categories and the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid. Secondly, we use that the\nBrauer-Picard 4-groupoid of $\\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$ can be identified with the\nPicard 4-groupoid of its Drinfeld center. Moreover, the Drinfeld center of\n$\\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$, which represents topological defects of the SymTFT, is\ncompletely described by a sylleptic strongly fusion 2-category formed by\ntopological surface defects of the SymTFT.

This paper develops an Alexandrov topological semantics of\nintuitionistic propositional modal logic internally in any elementary topos.\nThis is done by constructing interior and closure operators on the power-object\nassociated to a given relation in the ambient topos. When the relation is an\norder, these operators model intuitionistic S4; when the relation is an\nequivalence relation, they also model the characteristic (B) axiom of classical\nS5. The running example of interest arises from the Branching space-time of\nNuel Belnap, which is shown to induce a histories presheaf upon which can be\ndefined an equivalence relation of being obviously undivided at a given point\nevent. These results have some philosophical implications. For example, we\nstudy the branching space-time example in light of the indistinguishability\ninterpretation of epistemic modal logic. We will also study several famous\nfirst-order formulas in presheaf topos semantics such as the so-called Barcan\nformula. We shall see, however, that one of the Barcan converses is invalidated\nby a simple example of non-trivial space-time branching.

An\ninfinite game is defined as a play consisting of a fixed number of players\nwhose sequence of moves is repeated, or iterated ad infinitum. Each sequence\ncorresponds to a single iteration of the play, where there are an infinite\namount of iterations. There are two distinct concepts within this broad\ndefinition which encompass all infinite games: the strong infinite game and the\nweak infinite game. Both differ in terms of imputations. The strong infinite\ngame has a uniqueness qualification in that all moves must differ to the extent\nthat no imputation (these occur at the end of any given iteration) may ever be\nthe same. Conversely, there is no such qualification in a weak infinite game,\nany payout may equal another.\n  Another property shared by strong and weak infinite games (apart from their\nfulfilling the criterion of an infinite game) is the fact that both consist of\na countably infinite amount of moves. Therefore all infinite games have a\ncountably infinite number of turns; the set of all infinite games is composed\nof each strong and weak infinite game. This result has a very important\nconsequence: the ordinality of turns. That is, the moves of an infinite game\nhave an order or structure which they adhere to. It is this structure which\nprovides any future development or game theoretical analysis of these sorts of\ngames with the necessary foundation.\n",

We prove that the full subcategories K(A)^{w\n< n}, K(A)^{w > n}, K(A)^- and K(A)^+ (of objects isomorphic to suitably\nbounded complexes) of the homotopy category K(A) of an additive category A are\nidempotent complete, which confirms that (K(A)^{w <= 0}, K(A)^{w >= 0}) is a\nweight structure on K(A). We discuss weight complex functors and provide full\ndetails of an argument sketched by M. Bondarko, which shows that if w is a\nbounded weight structure on a triangulated category T that has a filtered\ntriangulated enhancement T' then there exists a strong weight complex functor T\n-> K(heart(w))^{anti}. Surprisingly, in order to carry out the proof, we need\nto impose an additional axiom on the filtered triangulated category T' which\nseems to be new.\n",

This result is analogous to the correspondence\nbetween measures and integrals. So, for example, we can speak of integration\nagainst an ultrafilter. Using this language, we show that the codensity monad\nof the inclusion of (finite-dimensional vector spaces) into (vector spaces) is\ndouble dualization. From this it follows that compact Hausdorff spaces have a\nlinear analogue: linearly compact vector spaces.

The second mode is dynamic: a network is a\npattern constructed by gluing functions of entities constituting the network.\nIn this paper, first we discuss that these two modes can be associated with the\ncategory theoretic duality (adjunction) and derive a natural network structure\n(a path notion) for each mode by appealing to the category theoretic\nuniversality. The path notion corresponding to the static mode is just the\nusual directed path. The path notion for the dynamic mode is called lateral\npath which is the alternating path considered on the set of arcs. Their general\nfunctionalities in a network are transport and coherence, respectively. Second,\nwe introduce a betweenness centrality of arcs for each mode and see how the two\nmodes are embedded in various real biological network data. We find that there\nis a trade-off relationship between the two centralities: if the value of one\nis large then the value of the other is small. This can be seen as a kind of\ndivision of labor in a network into transport on the network and coherence of\nthe network. Finally, we propose an optimization model of networks based on a\nquality function involving intensities of the two modes in order to see how\nnetworks with the above trade-off relationship can emerge through evolution. We\nshow that the trade-off relationship can be observed in the evolved networks\nonly when the dynamic mode is dominant in the quality function by numerical\nsimulations.

Differential categories were introduced as the\ncategorical framework for modelling differential linear logic. The deriving\ntransform of a differential category, which models the differentiation\ninference rule, is a derivation in the dual category. We here explore that\nderivation's universality.\n  One of the key structures associated to a codifferential category is an\nalgebra modality. This is a monad $T$ such that each object of the form $TC$ is\ncanonically an associative, commutative algebra. Consequently, every\n$T$-algebra has a canonical commutative algebra structure, and we show that\nuniversal derivations for these algebras can be constructed quite generally.\n  It is a standard result that there is a bijection between derivations from an\nassociative algebra $A$ to an $A$-module $M$ and algebra homomorphisms over $A$\nfrom $A$ to $A\\oplus M$, with $A\\oplus M$ being considered as an infinitesimal\nextension of $A$.

We can\nformalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric monoidal\ncategories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of\nobjects given by addition. In this approach, each kind of network corresponds\nto a prop, and each network of this kind is a morphism in that prop. A network\nwith $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to $n$, putting networks\ntogether in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring.\nHere we work out the details of this approach for various kinds of electrical\ncircuits, starting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive\nwires, then circuits with passive linear components, and then circuits that\nalso have voltage and current sources. Each kind of circuit corresponds to a\nmathematically natural prop. We describe the \"behavior\" of these circuits using\nmorphisms between props. In particular, we give a new proof of the black-boxing\ntheorem proved by Fong and the first author; unlike the original proof, this\nnew one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear components. We also use a\nmorphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and the\nsignal-flow diagrams in control theory. Technically, the key tools are the\nRosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters result relating circuits to special commutative\nFrobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and signatures, and a\nresult saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to props.\n",

Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of\ntopological spaces are used as the foundation of a compositional universal\nalgebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor products of polygraphs. We\nreconstruct several higher algebraic theories in this framework.\n  In this regard, the standard formalism of polygraphs has some technical\nproblems. We propose a notion of regular polygraph, barring cell boundaries\nthat are not homeomorphic to a disk of the appropriate dimension. We define a\ncategory of non-degenerate shapes, and show how to calculate their tensor\nproducts. Then, we introduce a notion of weak unit to recover weakly degenerate\nboundaries in low dimensions, and prove that the existence of weak units is\nequivalent to a representability property.\n  We then turn to applications of diagrammatic algebra to quantum theory.

We present by generators and\nequations the PROP IH of string diagrams whose free model is SVk. IH stands for\ninteracting Hopf algebras: its equations arise by distributive laws between\nHopf algebras, which we obtain using Lack's technique for composing PROPs. The\nsignificance of the result is two-fold. First, it offers a canonical\ndiagrammatic syntax for linear algebra: linear maps, kernels, subspaces, etc...\nare all faithfully represented in the graphical language. Second, the equations\nof IH describe familiar algebraic structures - Hopf algebras and Frobenius\nalgebras - which are at the heart of graphical formalisms as seemingly diverse\nas quantum circuits, signal flow graphs, simple electrical circuits and Petri\nnets. Our characterisation enlightens the provenance of these axioms and\nreveals their linear algebraic nature. Our second main contribution is an\napplication of IH to the semantics of signal processing circuits. We develop a\nformal theory of signal flow graphs, featuring a diagrammatic circuit syntax, a\nstructural operational semantics and a denotational semantics. We prove\ncompleteness of the equations of IH for denotational equivalence. Also, we\nstudy full abstraction: it turns out that the purely operational picture is too\nconcrete - two denotationally equal graphs may exhibit different operational\nbehaviour. We classify the ways in which this can occur and show that any graph\ncan be realised - rewritten, using the equations of IH, into an executable form\nwhere the operational behaviour and the denotation coincide. This realisability\ntheorem suggests a reflection about the role of causality in the semantics of\nsignal flow graphs and, more generally, of computing devices.\n",

While the restrictions he imposes\nmight seem conceptually unclear, we demonstrate that they are precisely the\nappropriate conditions to represent such monoids as internal monoids in an\nappropriate category of Ehrhard's finiteness spaces. Ehrhard introduced\nfiniteness spaces as the objects of a categorical model of classical linear\nlogic, where a set is equipped with a class of subsets to be thought of as\nfinitary. Morphisms are relations preserving the finitary structure. The notion\nof finitary subset allows for a sharper analysis of computational structure\nthan is available in the relational model. For example, fixed point operators\nfail to be finitary.\n  In the present work, we take morphisms to be partial functions preserving the\nfinitary structure rather than relations. The resulting category is symmetric\nmonoidal closed, complete and cocomplete. Any pair of an internal monoid in\nthis category and a ring induces a ring of generalized power series by an\nextension of the Ribenboim construction based on Ehrhard's notion of\nlinearization of a finiteness space. We thus further generalize Ribenboim's\nconstructions.

        "summary": "  These notes were originally developed as lecture notes for a category theory\ncourse. They should be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category\ntheory from scratch and has a scientific mind. There is no need to know\nadvanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is\ntraditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer\nscience. The only knowledge that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra.\nAll concepts are explained by giving concrete examples from different,\nnon-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph theory,\nand probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully\nevery reader can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is\nencouraged to read all the examples, this way they may even learn something new\nabout a different field.\n  Particular emphasis is given to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with\nboth intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and specific examples. Another\ncommon theme in these notes is the relationship between categories and directed\nmultigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this\nshows why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place\non a graph. From the pure math point of view, this can be seen as the\n1-dimensional first step into the theory of simplicial sets. Finally, monads\nand comonads are treated on an equal footing, differently to most literature in\nwhich comonads are often overlooked as \"just the dual to monads\". Theorems,\ninterpretations and concrete examples are given for monads as well as for\ncomonads.\n  This work, thoroughly revised and expanded, is now a book, with an extra\nsection on monoidal categories.\n",

If $\\mathcal{D}$ is standard well generated, such a heart is\nautomatically a Grothendieck category. For compactly generated t-structures (in\nany ambient triangulated category with coproducts), we prove that the heart is\na locally finitely presented Grothendieck category.\n  We use functor categories and the proofs rely on two main ingredients.\nFirstly, we express the heart of any t-structure in any triangulated category\nas a Serre quotient of the category of finitely presented additive functors for\nsuitable choices of subcategories of the aisle or the co-aisle that we,\nrespectively, call t-generating or t-cogenerating subcategories. Secondly, we\nstudy coproduct-preserving homological functors from $\\mathcal{D}$ to complete\nAB5 abelian categories with injective cogenerators and classify them, up to a\nso-called computational equivalence, in terms of pure-injective objects in\n$\\mathcal{D}$. This allows us to show that any standard well generated\ntriangulated category $\\mathcal{D}$ possesses a universal such\ncoproduct-preserving homological functor, to develop a purity theory and to\nprove that pure-injective objects always cogenerate t-structures in such\ntriangulated categories.\n",

The categorified Isbell duality\ninteracts with the Scott adjunction offering a categorification of the Scott\ntopology over a poset (hence the name). We show that the categorified Isbell\nduality is idempotent, similarly to its uncategorified version. From the\nlogical point of view, we use this machinery to provide candidate (geometric)\naxiomatizations of accessible categories with directed colimits. We discuss the\nconnection between these adjunctions and the theory of classifying topoi. We\nrelate our framework to the more classical theory of abstract elementary\nclasses.

This ambient abelian category is\nderived equivalent to the category $\\mathcal{E}$, and can be constructed as the\nheart $\\mathcal{LH}(\\mathcal{E})$ of a $\\operatorname{t}$-structure on the\nbounded derived category $\\operatorname{D^b}(\\mathcal{E})$ or as the\nlocalization of the category of monomorphisms in $\\mathcal{E}.$\n  However, there are natural examples of categories in functional analysis\nwhich are not quasi-abelian, but merely one-sided quasi-abelian or even weaker.\nExamples are the category of $\\operatorname{LB}$-spaces or the category of\ncomplete Hausdorff locally convex spaces. In this paper, we consider additive\nregular categories as a generalization of quasi-abelian categories that covers\nthe aforementioned examples. Additive regular categories can be characterized\nas those subcategories of abelian categories which are closed under subobjects.\n  As for quasi-abelian categories, we show that such an ambient abelian\ncategory of an additive regular category $\\mathcal{E}$ can be found as the\nheart of a $\\operatorname{t}$-structure on the bounded derived category\n$\\operatorname{D^b}(\\mathcal{E})$, or as the localization of the category of\nmonomorphisms of $\\mathcal{E}$.

We show how higher homotopy types are constructed\nfrom rewriting rules. These correspond to morphisms of an $n$-fold category.\nSubsequently, the $n \\to \\infty$ limit of the Wolfram model rulial multiway\nsystem is identified as an $\\infty$-groupoid, with the latter being relevant\ngiven Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis.

This correspondence to higher categorical\nstructures offers a new way to understand how spaces relevant to physics may\narise from pregeometric combinatorial models.

In this short note, we\nshow that this rig homomorphism can be upgraded to a rig *functor*, when we\nreplace the set of Dirichlet polynomials by the *category* of ordinary\n(Cartesian) polynomials.\n  In the Cartesian case, the process has three steps. The first step is a rig\nfunctor PolyCart -> Poly sending a polynomial p to (dp)y, where dp is the\nderivative of p. The second is a rig functor Poly -> Set x Set^op, sending a\npolynomial q to the pair (q(1),Gamma(q)), where Gamma(q)=Poly(q,y) can be\ninterpreted as the global sections of q viewed as a bundle, and q(1) as its\nbase. To make this precise we define what appears to be a new distributive\nmonoidal structure on Set x Set^op, which can be understood geometrically in\nterms of rectangles. The last step, as for Dirichlet polynomials, is simply to\nextract the entropy as a real number from a pair of sets (A,B); it is given by\nlog A - log B^(1/A) and can be thought of as the log aspect ratio of the\nrectangle.\n",

One of its first features is that it allows a novel description of\nseparable and naturally full functors in terms of faithful and full functors,\nrespectively. To any semiseparable functor we attach an invariant, given by an\nidempotent natural transformation, which controls when the functor is separable\nand yields a characterization of separable functors in terms of (dual) Maschke\nand conservative functors. We prove that any semiseparable functor admits a\ncanonical factorization as a naturally full functor followed by a separable\nfunctor. Here the main tool is the construction of the coidentifier category\nattached to the associated idempotent natural transformation. Then we move our\nattention to the semiseparability of functors that have an adjoint. First we\nobtain a Rafael-type Theorem. Next we characterize the semiseparability of\nadjoint functors in terms of the (co)separability of the associated (co)monads\nand the natural fullness of the corresponding (co)comparison functor.

Closely related to Markov\ncategories are gs-monoidal categories, also known as CD categories. These omit\na condition that implements the normalization of probability. Extending work of\nCorradini and Gadducci, we construct free gs-monoidal and free Markov\ncategories generated by a collection of morphisms of arbitrary arity and\ncoarity. For free gs-monoidal categories, this comes in the form of an explicit\ncombinatorial description of their morphisms as structured cospans of labeled\nhypergraphs. These can be thought of as a formalization of gs-monoidal string\ndiagrams ($=$term graphs) as a combinatorial data structure. We formulate the\nappropriate $2$-categorical universal property based on ideas of Walters and\nprove that our categories satisfy it.\n  We expect our free categories to be relevant for computer implementations and\nwe also argue that they can be used as statistical causal models generalizing\nBayesian networks.\n",

The role of equivalence extensions, which leave the theory the same\nup to Morita equivalence, is investigated.\n  Motivated by the question what the big Zariski topos of a non-affine scheme\nclassifies, we show how to construct a syntactic presentation for a topos if\nsyntactic presentations for a covering family of open subtoposes are given. For\nthis, we introduce conditional theory extensions that require part of the data\na model is made of only under some condition given in the form of a closed\ngeometric formula.

        "summary": "  This thesis introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models\nbased on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and\nquantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text\nand sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement\nstructure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to\nmake this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from\ngrammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete\nalgorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of\nparameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum\nalgorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the\nmeaning of sentences in data-driven tasks.\n  The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy\n(Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory\nof which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are\nthe core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a\nhigh level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical\nstructures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or\narbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract\ndiagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific\nlibraries.\n  The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised\nfunctors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept\nfor the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine\nlearning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In\norder to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce\nthe notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing\nthe gradients of parameterised diagrams.\n",

They arise for\nexample as Kleisli categories of commutative monads on cartesian categories,\nand as such they provide a general framework for effectful computation.\nRecently proposed in the context of categorical probability, Markov categories\nare gs-monoidal categories where the monoidal unit is also terminal, and they\narise for example as Kleisli categories of commutative affine monads, where\naffine means that the monad preserves the monoidal unit.\n  The aim of this paper is to study a new condition on the gs-monoidal\nstructure, resulting in the concept of weakly Markov categories, which is\nintermediate between gs-monoidal categories and Markov ones. In a weakly Markov\ncategory, the morphisms to the monoidal unit are not necessarily unique, but\nform a group. As we show, these categories exhibit a rich theory of conditional\nindependence for morphisms, generalising the known theory for Markov\ncategories. We also introduce the corresponding notion for commutative monads,\nwhich we call weakly affine, and for which we give two equivalent\ncharacterisations.\n  The paper argues that these monads are relevant to the study of categorical\nprobability. A case at hand is the monad of finite non-zero measures, which is\nweakly affine but not affine.

This\nnotion of independence is handy when it comes to systems coming from physics,\nbut when directly applied to classical algebras, subobject independence is not\nentirely satisfactory. The sole purpose of this note is to introduce the notion\nof subalgebra independence, which is a slight variation of subobject\nindependence, yet this modification enables us to connect subalgebra\nindependence to more traditional notions of independence.

This result was recently extended to Lie algebras\nand to cocommutative Hopf algebras.\n  The aim of the present article is to explore the feasibility of adapting the\ntheorem to other types of algebraic structures. By explaining the underlying\nunity of the three known cases, our analysis gives necessary and sufficient\nconditions for this to happen.\n  From those we may for instance conclude that a version for crossed modules\ncan indeed be attained, while the theorem cannot be adapted to, say,\nassociative algebras, Jordan algebras or Leibniz algebras, when working over an\ninfinite field: we prove that then, amongst non-associative algebras, only Lie\nalgebras admit a universal Kaluzhnin--Krasner embedding theorem.\n",

They are broadly referred as linearly\ncompatible, matching, and totally compatible structures. This paper gives a\nunified approach to these structures in the context of operads. We first\ngeneralize the process of polarization for polynomials in invariant theory to\nthe one for operads, leading to the general notion of linearly compatible\noperads. Refining the polarization by partitioning it into foliations, we\nobtain a notion of matching operads consolidating those appeared recently from\napplications of regularity structures, and Volterra integral equations.\nDistinguished among them is the leveled matching compatibility, which is unique\nwith respect to a fix ordering of the vertices in tree monomials. Equating all\nmatching compatibilities of a given operad leads to the totally compatible\noperad of this operad.\n  For unary/binary quadratic operads, the linear compatibility and the total\ncompatibility are in Koszul dual to each other, and there is a Koszul\nself-duality among the matching compatibilities. In particular, the leveled\nmatching compatibility is Koszul self-dual. For binary quadratic operads, these\nthree compatible operads can also be obtained by taking Manin black and white\nproducts. For some finitely generated binary quadratic operad, Koszulity is\npreserved under taking the compatibilities.\n",

In\nthis paper, we make this analogy precise, using the language of relational\ndoctrines, a categorical tool that provides a functorial description of the\ncalculus of relations, in the same way Lawvere's hyperdoctrines give a\nfunctorial description of predicate logic. Given a relational doctrine, we\ndefine Cauchy-complete objects as those objects of the domain category\nsatisfying the rule of unique choice. Then, we present a universal construction\nthat completes a relational doctrine with the rule of unique choice, that is,\nproducing a new relational doctrine where all objects are Cauchy-complete. We\nalso introduce relational doctrines with singleton objects and show that these\nhave the minimal structure needed to build the reflector of the full\nsubcategory of its domain on Cauchy-complete objects. The main result is that\nthis reflector exists if and only if the relational doctrine has singleton\nobjects and this happens if and only if its restriction to Cauchy-complete\nobjects is equivalent to its completion with the rule of unique choice. We\nsupport our results with many examples, also falling outside the scope of\nstandard doctrines, such as complete metric spaces, Banach spaces and compact\nHausdorff spaces in the general context of monoidal topology, which are all\nshown to be Cauchy-complete objects for appropriate relational doctrines.\n",

Key to our approach is to treat them\nconsequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of\nnormed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when\nconsidering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can\nbe challenging when considering some large categories, like those of\nsemi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized\nmetric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed\nin detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a\nvalue recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the\nextended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure\ngap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present\nin the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets.\nTo show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over\nit, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of\nlight alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory\nis the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of\nweighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to\nprove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We\nalso prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy\ncocomplete normed categories.\n",

Our results generalize the description of\nnon-commutative localizations of rings in terms of weight-exact localizations\ngiven in an earlier paper of the first author. That paper was essentially\ndevoted to weight-exact localizations by compactly generated subcategories,\nwhereas in the current text we focus on \"more complicated\" localizations.\n  We recall that two types of localizations of the sort we are interested in\nwere studied by several authors. They took C=D(R-mod); the heart of the first\nt-structure was equivalent to R-mod, and the second heart was equivalent to the\nexact abelian category $U_{contra}\\subset R-mod$ of U-contramodules\n(corresponding to a set of Proj R-mod-morphisms U related either to a\nhomological ring epimorphism $u:R\\to UU$ or to an ideal of I of R). The functor\n$R-mod\\to U_{contra}$ induced by pi is a certain completion one. Consequently,\nthe hearts of the corresponding weight structures are equivalent to Proj R-mod\nand to the subcategory of projective objects of U_{contra}, respectively.\nMoreover, the connecting functors between these categories are isomorphic to\nones coming from any weight structure class-generated by a single compact\nobject whose endomorphism ring is R^{op}; in particular, one can take R=Z and\nC=SH and re-prove some important statements due to Bousfield.\n",

Street's work was in part inspired by Robert's attempts to\nuse N-category ideas to construct nets of C*-algebras in Minkowski space for\napplications to relativistic quantum field theory: Roberts' additional\nchallenge was that `no amount of staring at the low dimensional cocycle\nconditions would reveal the pattern for higher dimensions'. This report takes\nup this challenge, presenting a natural inductive construction of explicit\ncubical cocyle conditions, and gives three ways in which the simplicial ones\ncan be derived from these. (A dual string-diagram version of this work, giving\nrise to a Pascal's triangle of diagrams for cocycle conditions, has been\ndescribed elsewhere by Street). A consequence of this work is that the\nYang-Baxter equation, the `pentagon of pentagons', and higher simplex\nequations, are in essence different manifestations of the same underlying\nabstract structure. There has been recent interest in higher-categories, by\ncomputer scientists investigating concurrency theory, as well as by physicists,\namong others. The dual `string' version of this paper makes clear the\nrelationship with higher-dimensional simplex equations in physics. Much work in\nthis area has been done since these notes were written: no attempt has been\nmade to update the original report. However, all diagrams have been redrawn by\ncomputer, replacing all original hand-drawn pictures.\n",

An olog is like a \"concept web\" or \"semantic network\" except\nthat it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory.\nThis key difference ensures that an olog is unambiguous, highly adaptable to\nevolution and change, and suitable for sharing concepts with other olog. We\nconsider simple cases of alpha-helical and amyloid-like protein filaments\nsubjected to axial extension and develop an olog representation of their\nstructural and resulting mechanical properties. We also construct a\nrepresentation of a social network in which people send text-messages to their\nnearest neighbors and act as a team to perform a task. We show that the olog\nfor the protein and the olog for the social network feature identical\ncategory-theoretic representations, and we proceed to precisely explicate the\nanalogy or isomorphism between them. The examples presented here demonstrate\nthat the intrinsic nature of a complex system, which in particular includes a\nprecise relationship between structure and function at different hierarchical\nlevels, can be effectively represented by an olog. This, in turn, allows for\ncomparative studies between disparate materials or fields of application, and\nresults in novel approaches to derive functionality in the design of de novo\nhierarchical systems. We discuss opportunities and challenges associated with\nthe description of complex biological materials by using ologs as a powerful\ntool for analysis and design in the context of materiomics, and we present the\npotential impact of this approach for engineering, life sciences, and medicine.\n",

        "summary": "  Bayes' rule tells us how to invert a causal process in order to update our\nbeliefs in light of new evidence. If the process is believed to have a complex\ncompositional structure, we may observe that the inversion of the whole can be\ncomputed piecewise in terms of the component processes. We study the structure\nof this compositional rule, noting that it relates to the lens pattern in\nfunctional programming. Working in a suitably general axiomatic presentation of\na category of Markov kernels, we see how we can think of Bayesian inversion as\na particular instance of a state-dependent morphism in a fibred category. We\ndiscuss the compositional nature of this, formulated as a functor on the\nunderlying category and explore how this can used for a more type-driven\napproach to statistical inference.\n",

We\nshow that group-theoretical fusion 2-categories are completely characterized by\nthe property that the braided fusion 1-category of endomorphisms of the\nmonoidal unit is Tannakian. Then, we describe the underlying finite semisimple\n2-category of group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and, more generally, of\ncertain 2-categories of bimodules. We also partially describe the fusion rules\nof group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and investigate the group gradings of\nsuch fusion 2-categories. Using our previous results, we classify fusion\n2-categories admitting a fiber 2-functor. Next, we study fusion 2-categories\nwith a Tambara-Yamagami defect, that is $\\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded fusion\n2-categories whose non-trivially graded factor is $\\mathbf{2Vect}$. We classify\nthese fusion 2-categories, and examine more closely the more restrictive notion\nof Tambara-Yamagami fusion 2-categories.

Retrodiction is applicable even when the\ndynamics is not reversible, and it agrees with the reverse dynamics when it\nexists, so that retrodiction may be viewed as an extension of inversion, i.e.,\ntime-reversal. Recently, an axiomatic definition of retrodiction has been made\nin a way that is applicable to both classical and quantum probability using\nideas from category theory. Almost simultaneously, a framework for information\nflow in in terms of semicartesian categories has been proposed in the setting\nof categorical probability theory. Here, we formulate a general definition of\nretrodiction to add to the information flow axioms in semicartesian categories,\nthus providing an abstract framework for retrodiction beyond classical and\nquantum probability theory. More precisely, we extend Bayesian inference, and\nmore generally Jeffrey's probability kinematics, to arbitrary semicartesian\ncategories.\n",

We demonstrate the existence of higher homotopies in this\nclass of rewriting systems, where homotopical maps are induced by the inclusion\nof appropriate rewriting rules taken from an abstract rulial space of all\npossible such rules. Furthermore, we show that a multiway rewriting system with\nhomotopies up to order $n$ may naturally be formalized as an $n$-fold category,\nsuch that (upon inclusion of appropriate inverse morphisms via invertible\nrewriting relations) the infinite limit of this structure yields an\n${\\infty}$-groupoid. Via Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis, this\n${\\infty}$-groupoid thus inherits the structure of a formal homotopy space. We\nconclude with some comments on how this computational framework of homotopical\nmultiway systems may potentially be used for making formal connections to\nhomotopy spaces upon which models relevant to physics may be instantiated.\n",
