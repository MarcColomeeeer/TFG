A\nbreakdown of table equivalence among the half a trillion multiplication schemes\nthe Sedenions allow is found; the 168 elements of PSL(2,7), defining the finite\nprojective triangle on which the Octonions' 480 equivalent multiplication\ntables are frequently deployed, are shown to give the exact count of primitive\nunit zero-divisors in the Sedenions. (Composite zero-divisors, comprising all\npoints of certain hyperplanes of up to 4 dimensions, are also determined.) The\n168 are arranged in point-set quartets along the 42 Assessors (pairs of\ndiagonals in planes spanned by pure imaginaries, each of which zero-divides\nonly one such diagonal of any partner Assessor). These quartets are\nmultiplicatively organized in systems of mutually zero-dividing trios of\nAssessors, a D4-suggestive 28 in number, obeying the 6-cycle crossover logic of\ntrefoils or triple zigzags. 3 trefoils and 1 zigzag determine an octahedral\nvertex structure we call a box-kite -- seven of which serve to partition\nSedenion space. By sequential execution of proof-driven production rules, a\ncomplete interconnected box-kite system, or Seinfeld production (German for\nfield of being; American for 1990's television's Show About Nothing), can be\nunfolded from an arbitrary Octonion and any (save for two) of the Sedenions.\nIndications for extending the results to higher dimensions and different\ndynamic contexts are given in the final pages.\n",

The vanishing of Riemann Zeta\nreduces to an orthogonality condition for the eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian\noperator D^+ having the zeros of Riemann Zeta as its eigenvalues. The\nconstruction of D^+ is inspired by the conviction that Riemann Zeta is\nassociated with a physical system allowing superconformal transformations as\nits symmetries and second quantization in terms of the representations of\nsuperconformal algebra. The eigenfunctions of D^+ are analogous to the so\ncalled coherent states and in general not orthogonal to each other. The states\northogonal to a vacuum state (having a negative norm squared) correspond to the\nzeros of Riemann Zeta. The physical states having a positive norm squared\ncorrespond to the zeros of Riemann Zeta at the critical line. Riemann\nhypothesis follows by reductio ad absurdum from the hypothesis that ordinary\nsuperconformal algebra acts as gauge symmetries for all coherent states\northogonal to the vacuum state, including also the non-physical coherent states\nthat might exist off from the critical line.\n",

The cyclic group of units G_k in Z_k(.) has order\n(p-1)p^{k-1}, implying product structure G_k = A_k B_k. Here core A_k of order\np-1 is an extension for k >1 of Fermat's Small Theorem (FST*), where n^p == n\n(mod p^k) for each core residue, while extension subgroup B_k has order\np^{k-1}. It is shown that each subgroup S >1 of core A_k has zero sum, and that\np+1 generates subgroup B_k of all n == 1 (mod p) in G_k. The p-th power\nresidues n^p mod p^k in G_k form an order |G_k|/p subgroup F_k, with\n|F_k|/|A_k| = p^{k-2}, so F_k properly contains core A_k for k >2. By quadratic\nanalysis (mod p^3) rather than linear analysis (mod p^2, re Hensel's lemma\n[5]), the additive structure of subgroups G_k and F_k is derived. ... Successor\nfunction S(n)=n+1 combines with the two arithmetic symmetries -n (complement)\nand 1/n (inverse) to yield the \"triplet structure\" of G_k : three inverse pairs\n{n_i, 1/(n_i)} with (n_i)+1 = - 1/n_{i+1} (mod p^k), with indices mod 3, and\nproduct n_0.n_1.n_2 = 1 mod p^k. In case n_0 = n_1 = n_2 = n this reduces to\nthe cubic root solution n+1 = -(1/n) = -(n^2) (mod p^k, p=1 mod 6). The\nproperty \"EDS\" of exponent p distributing over a sum of core residues: (x+y)^p\n== x+y == x^p + y^p (mod p^k), is employed to derive the known FLT inequality\nfor integers. In other words, to any FLT(mod p^k) equivalence for k digits\ncorrespond p-th power integers of pk digits, and the (p-1)k \"carries\" make the\ndifference, representing the sum of mixed-terms in the binomial expansion.\n",

The vanishing of the\nRieman Zeta reduces to an orthogonality condition for the eigenfunctions of a\nnon-Hermitian operator $D^+$ having the zeros of Riemann Zeta as its\neigenvalues. The construction of $D^+$ is inspired by the conviction that\nRiemann Zeta is associated with a physical system allowing conformal\ntransformations as its symmetries. The eigenfunctions of $D^+$ are analogous to\nthe so called coherent states and in general not orthogonal to each other. The\nstates orthogonal to a vacuum state (which has a negative norm squared)\ncorrespond to the zeros of the Riemann Zeta. The induced metric in the space\n${\\cal{V}}$ of states which correspond to the zeros of the Riemann Zeta at the\ncritical line $Re[s]=1/2$ is hermitian and both hermiticity and positive\ndefiniteness properties imply Riemann hypothesis. Conformal invariance in the\nsense of gauge invariance allows only the states belonging to ${\\cal{V}}$.\nRiemann hypothesis follows also from a restricted form of a dynamical conformal\ninvariance in ${\\cal{V}}$ and one can reduce the proof to a standard analytic\nargument used in Lie group theory.\n",

In addition, a framework of contradiction\noriented learning philosophy inspired from the Later Trigrams of King Wen in\nI-ching is meanwhile presented. It is shown that although A and Non-A are\nlogically inconsistent, but they are philosophically consistent in the sense\nthat Non-A can be the unintentionally instead of negation that leads to\nconfusion. It is also shown that Buddhism and Daoism play an important role in\nneutrosophy, and should be extended in the way of neutrosophy to all sciences\naccording to the original intention of neutrosophy.\n",

Application of the deformation principle appears to be\nnot consecutive, and the Riemannian geometry appears to be not completely\nconsistent. Two different definitions of two vectors parallelism are\ninvestigated and compared. The first definitions is based on the deformation\nprinciple. The second definition is the conventional definition of parallelism,\nwhich is used in the Riemannian geometry. It is shown, that the second\ndefinition is inconsistent. It leads to absence of absolute parallelism in\nRiemannian geometry and to discrimination of outcome outside the framework of\nthe Riemannian geometry at description of the space-time geometry.\n",

Three alternative market scenarios (probability spaces)\nhave been explored -- 'Down', 'Neutral' and 'Up', categorized according to\nwhether the price of the underlying security is most likely to go down, stay\nunchanged or go up. The methodology used is computational, primarily based on\nsimulation and numerical extrapolation.

In a further section we complete the results about inner and outer\nradii of general boxes and cross-polytopes. Finally, because cubes and regular\ncross-polytopes are radii-minimal projections of simplices, we show that it is\npossible to deduce the results about their radii from the results about the\nouter radii of simplices.\n",

In this monograph, the basic methods of nonstandard analysis for\nn-dimensional Euclidean spaces are presented. Specific rules are deveoped and\nthese methods and rules are applied to rigorous integral and differential\nmodeling. The topics include Robinson infinitesimals, limited and infinite\nnumbers; convergence theory, continuity, *-transfer, internal definition,\nhyprefinite summation, Riemann-Stieltjes integration over Jordan-measurable\nregions; modeling with integrals via Infinite Sum Theorems; the nonstandard\nintegral modeling rules - the method of constants, the methods of max. and\nmin., and the hyperfinite sum; pure infinitesimal integral modeling via\ngeometric elements; microgeometry, line and surface integrals, gauge integrals,\nfluxions and their relations to dynamic geometry. These rigorous results are\nalso applied to lengths of curves, areas and volumes for Jordan-measurable\nregions, incompressible fluids, moments of inertia, electric field vectors,\nforce fields and very elementary physics. Also presented are rigorous\ndifferential derivations for the partial differential equations for internal\nheat transfer and the vibrating membrane. All results are rigorously\nestablished and, mostly, all proofs appear in the appendix.\n",

The study of\nan $n$-dimensional stellar sphere with the boundary faces identified in pairs\nleads us to Coxeter groups of stellar manifolds. Analysis of these Coxeter\ngroups allows us to single out the class of so called flat stellar manifolds.\nFlat stellar manifolds are not only very common but also possess a range of\nsimple properties that allow to prove some difficult long standing statements.\nIn particular, there exists a simple proof of the Poincar\\`e conjecture for\nflat manifolds.It is not possible to carry out this simple proof for a general\nstellar manifolds because of certain singularities that can be characterized in\nterms of Coxeter groups. The results and ideas presented in this paper not only\nopen a new way that may lead to entirely combinatorial and algebraic proof of\nthe Poincar\\`e conjecture but also suggest a new technique for studying stellar\nmanifolds in terms of properties of their Coxeter groups.\n",

We exploit the fact\nthat option price and random arbitrage returns change on different time scales\nwhich allows us to develop an asymptotic pricing theory involving the central\nlimit theorem for random processes. We restrict ourselves to finding pricing\nbands for options rather than exact prices. The resulting pricing bands are\nshown to be independent of the detailed statistical characteristics of the\narbitrage return.

The Cauchy-Riemann relations, characteristical and canonical\nrelations, the Bianchi identities and others are examples of identical\nrelations. It can be shown that all these relations express either the\nconditions of closure of exterior (skew-symmetric) differential forms and\ncorresponding dual forms or the properties of closed exterior forms. Since the\nclosed differential forms are invariant under all transformations, which\nconserve the differential (these are gauge transformations: unitary, canonical,\ngradient and others), from this it follows that identical relations are a\nmathematical representation of relevant invariant and covariant objects.\n  The theory of exterior differential forms cannot answer the question of how\ndo invariant objects appear and what does these objects generate?\n  The answer to this question can be obtained using the skew-symmetric\ndifferential forms, which possess the evolutionary properties. The mathematical\napparatus of such evolutionary forms contains nonidentical relations, from\nwhich the identical relations corresponding to invariant objects are obtained\nwith the help of degenerate transformations. Due to such potentialities, the\nmathematical apparatus of skew-symmetrical differential forms enables one to\ndescribe discrete transitions, evolutionary processes and generation of various\nstructures.\n",

The rightmost factor (the row vector)\nlikewise represents the right quaternion and the right-isoclinic part of the 4D\nrotation.\n  Finally the intrinsic geometrical meaning of this matrix-based proof is\nestablished by means of the usual similarity transformations.\n",

In general, $A \\otimes\nB$ is not a lattice; for instance, we proved that $M\\_3\\otimes F(3)$ is not a\nlattice. In this paper, we introduce a new lattice construction, the box\nproduct for arbitrary lattices. The tensor product construction for complete\nlattices introduced by G. N. Raney in 1960 and by R. Wille in 1985 and the\ntensor product construction of A. Fraser in 1978 for semilattices bear some\nformal resemblance to the new construction. For lattices A and B, while their\ntensor product $A\\otimes B$ (as semilattices) is not always a lattice, the box\nproduct, $A \\bp B$, is always a lattice. Furthermore, the box product and some\nof its ideals behave like an improved tensor product. For example, if A and B\nare lattices with unit, then the isomorphism $Conc(A $\\bp$ B) \\cong Conc A\n\\otimes Conc B$ holds. There are analogous results for lattices A and B with\nzero and for a bounded lattice A and an arbitrary lattice B. A join-semilattice\nS with zero is called {0}-representable, if there exists a lattice L with zero\nsuch that $Conc L \\cong S$. The above isomorphism results yield the following\nconsequence: The tensor product of two {0}-representable semilattices is\n{0}-representable.\n",

If $A \\otimes\nB$ is a capped tensor product, then $A \\otimes B$ is a lattice (the converse is\nnot known). In this paper, we investigate lattices A with zero enjoying the\nproperty that $A \\otimes B$ is a capped tensor product, for every lattice B\nwith zero; we shall call such lattices amenable. The &#64257;rst author\nintroduced in 1966 the concept of a sharply transferable lattice. In 1972, H.\nGaskill [5] de&#64257;ned, similarly, sharply transferable semilattices, and\ncharacterized them by a very e&#64256;ective condition (T). We prove that a\n&#64257;nite lattice A is amenable iff it is sharply transferable as a\njoin-semilattice. For a general lattice A with zero, we obtain the result: A is\namenable iff A is locally &#64257;nite and every &#64257;nite sublattice of A\nis transferable as a join-semilattice. This yields, for example, that a\n&#64257;nite lattice A is amenable iff $A\\otimes F(3)$ is a lattice iff A\nsatis&#64257;es (T), with respect to $\\jj$. In particular, $M3 \\otimes F(3)$ is\nnot a lattice. This solves a problem raised by R. W. Quackenbush in 1985\nwhether the tensor product of lattices with zero is always a lattice.\n",

The\nmonoid Dim L is commutative and conical, the latter meaning that the sum of any\ntwo nonzero elements is nonzero. Furthermore, Dim L is given along with the\ndimension map, $\\Dim$, from L x L to Dim L, which has the intuitive meaning of\na distance function. The maximal semilattice quotient of Dim L is isomorphic to\nthe semilattice Conc L of compact congruences of L; hence Dim L is a precursor\nof the congruence lattice of L. Here are some additional features of this\nconstruction: (1) Our dimension theory provides a generalization to all\nlattices of the von Neumann dimension theory of continuous geometries. In\nparticular, if L is an irreducible continuous geometry, then Dim L is either\nisomorphic to Z^+ or to R^+. (2) If L has no infinite bounded chains, then Dim\nL embeds (as an ordered monoid) into a power of Z^+ $\\cup$ {$\\infty$}. (3) If L\nis modular or if L has no infinite bounded chains, then Dim L is a refinement\nmonoid. (4) If L is a simple geometric lattice, then DimL is isomorphic to Z^+,\nif L is modular, and to the two-element semilattice, otherwise. (5) If L is a\ncountably meet-continuous complemented modular lattice, then both Dim L and the\ndimension function $\\Dim$ satisfy (countable) completeness properties. If R is\na von Neumann regular ring and if L is the lattice of principal right ideals of\nthe matrix ring M\\_2(R), then Dim L is isomorphic to the monoid V(R) of\nisomorphism classes of finitely generated projective right R-modules.

        "summary": "  The first crisis in the geometry arose in the beginning of XIXth century,\nwhen the mathematicians rejected the non-Euclidean geometry as a possible\ngeometry of the real world. Now we observe unreasonable rejection of the\nnon-Riemannian geometry by the official representatives of the contemporary\ngeometry. Class of the Riemannian geometries appears to be too narrow for\nphysical applications. The microcosm physics needs expansion of the class of\npossible geometries appropriate for the role of space-time geometry. In the\nframework of the non-Riemannian geometry one can construct the space-time\ngeometry, where the motion of free particles is primordially stochastic, and\nthis stochasticity depends on the particle mass. At the same time the geometry\nin itself is not stochastic in the sense that the space-time intervals are\ndeterministic. Principles of quantum mechanics can be deduced from such a\nspace-time geometry. The crisis situation in geometry appears to be connected\nwith some preconceptions concerning the foundation of the geometry. The\npreconceptions as well as the crisis generated by them are not purely\nscientific phenomena. The human factor (social aspect) is rather strong in the\ncrisis phenomena. The preconceptions and the human factor appear to be so\nstrong, that usual logical arguments are not perceived, and the usual formal\nmathematical language appears to be inappropriate for perception of an analysis\nof the crisis origin and of a possibility of its overcoming. In the paper the\nhistory and motives of the non-Riemannian geometry construction are presented.\nThere is a hope that such a less formal way of presentation helps to understand\nand to overcome the existing preconceptions.\n",

This lattice that corresponds to graphs\ncontaining n vertices is called an n-lattice and is made up of certain rows of\nvertex pairs (i, j). Each row of this n-lattice is made up of those\nvertex-pairs, say (i, j), for which the difference|i - j| is the same for every\nvertex-pair belonging to that row, and where i, j belongs to set {1, 2, ...,\nn}.

The second row of this n-lattice contains (n - 2)\nvertex pairs, (i, i + 2), i = 1, 2, ..., (n - 2). In this way, one goes down to\nthe last row of this lattice which contains only one vertex-pair, (1, n). A\nlattice path is one made up of (n - 1) vertex pairs such that every row of the\ntriangular lattice contributes exactly one vertex pair to this lattice path. We\nobtain all possible lattice paths without omission or repetition by generating\nthem in a systematic way, in a well-defined lexicographic order. The collection\nof all such lattice paths forms all possible graceful graphs. We will note\nvarious observations related to these lattice paths. For example, the lattice\npaths appear in symmetric pairs, i.e. for each lattice path there exists a\ncorresponding unique lattice path which is the mirror image of this lattice\npath taken in the line of symmetry passing vertically and centrally through the\nlattice, each lattice path and its corresponding mirror image represent\nisomorphic graceful graphs.

Most of these models use the concept of matrices.

This book introduces the concept of bimatrices, and studies several\nnotions like bieigen values, bieigen vectors, characteristic bipolynomials,\nbitransformations, bioperators and bidiagonalization. Further, we introduce and\nexplore the concepts like fuzzy bimatrices, neutrosophic bimatrices and fuzzy\nneutrosophic bimatrices, which will find its application in fuzzy and\nneutrosophic logic.\n",

The FRM tool is specially chosen for two reasons: It can give the\nhidden pattern of the dynamical system and as the socio-economic condition of\nwomen infected with HIV/AIDS is interdependent we choose this special fuzzy\ntool called FRM. In Chapter 3, we use Fuzzy Associative Memories (FAM) to\nanalyze the problem because FAM is the only fuzzy tool that can give the\ngradations of each of the nodes/concepts. In Chapter 4 for the first time we\nuse neutrosophic theory in general and neutrosophic relational maps (NRM) in\nparticular to analyze this problem. Interested readers can compare and analyze\nthe two models FRM and NRM. This chapter introduces the notion of Neutrosophic\nAssociative Memories (NAMs) that is an analogous model of Fuzzy Associative\nMemories. NAMs are applied to this problem and conclusions are based on this\nanalysis. The sixth chapter gives the translated version of the verbatim\ninterviews of the 101 HIV/AIDS infected, rural, uneducated, and poor women of\nTamil Nadu.\n",

This book has for the first time,\nintroduced a new algebraic structure called linear bialgebra, which is also a\nvery powerful algebraic tool that can yield itself to applications. With the\nrecent introduction of bimatrices (2005)we have ventured in this book to\nintroduce new concepts like linear bialgebra and Smarandache neutrosophic\nlinear bialgebra and also give the applications of these algebraic structures.\n  It is important to mention here it is a matter of simple exercise to extend\nthese to linear n-algebra for any n greater than 2; for n = 2 we get the linear\nbialgebra. This book has five chapters. In the first chapter we just introduce\nsome basic notions of linear algebra and Slinear algebra and their\napplications. Chapter two introduces some new algebraic bistructures. In\nchapter three we introduce the notion of linear bialgebra and discuss several\ninteresting properties about them. Also, application of linear bialgebra to\nbicodes is given. A remarkable part of our research in this book is the\nintroduction of the notion of birepresentation of bigroups. The fourth chapter\nintroduces several neutrosophic algebraic structures since they help in\ndefining the new concept of neutrosophic linear bialgebra, neutrosophic\nbivector spaces, Smarandache neutrosophic linear bialgebra and Smarandache\nneutrosophic bivector spaces.

There are various interpretations of\nthe sentence \"Two algebras have the same algebraic geometry\". One of these is\nautomorphic equivalence of algebras, which is discussed in this paper, and the\nother interpretation is geometric equivalence of algebras. In this paper we\nconsider very wide and natural class of algebras: one sorted algebras from IBN\nvariety. The variety is called an IBM variety if two free algebras W(X), W(Y)\nof this variety are isomorphic if and only if the powers of sets X and Y\ncoincide. In the researching of the automorphic equivalence of algebras we must\nstudy the group of automorphisms of the category of the all finitely generated\nfree algebras of our variety and the group of its automorphisms. By [PZ,\nTheorem 2], if we deal with an IBN variety of one-sorted algebras, then every\nstrongly stable (see Definition 3.1) automorphism of our category defines the\nother algebraic structure on every algebra H of our variety, such that this\nalgebra with the new algebraic structure automorphically equivalent to the\nalgebra H (Theorem 4.1), i.e., has the same algebraic geometry. From this we\nconclude the necessary and sufficient conditions for two algebras to be\nautomorphically equivalent. We formulate these conditions by using the notion\nof geometric equivalence of algebras. It means that we reduce automorphic\nequivalence of algebras to the simpler notion of geometric equivalence.

Such a\nconstruction of the generalized geometries (known as T-geometries) uses well\nknown algorithms of the proper Euclidean geometry and nothing besides.

So for the first time we have defined a\nn-adaptive fuzzy model which can view or analyze the problem in n ways (n >=2)\nThough we have defined these n- adaptive fuzzy models theorectically we are not\nin a position to get a n-adaptive fuzzy model for n > 2 for practical real\nworld problems. The highlight of this model is its capacity to analyze the same\nproblem in different ways thereby arriving at various solutions that mirror\nmultiple perspectives.\n  We have used the 2-adaptive fuzzy model having the two fuzzy models, fuzzy\nmatrices model and BAMs viz. model to analyze the views of public about HIV/\nAIDS disease, patient and the awareness program. This book has five chapters\nand 6 appendices. The first chapter just recalls the definition of four fuzzy\nmodels used in this book and gives illustration of some of them. Chapter two\nintroduces the new n-adaptive fuzzy models. Chapter three uses for the first\ntime 2 adaptive fuzzy models to study psychological and sociological problems\nabout HIV/AIDS.

Among some of the unbelievable results `proved' in the\npaper we can find statements like that: (i) a linear transformation which is a\nrotation in R^2 with rotation angle theta different from nphi/2, is\ninconsistent with arithmetic, (ii) complex number theory is inconsistent.\nBesides these 'results' of mathematical nature [1],offers also a `proof' that\nSpecial Relativity is inconsistent. Now, we are left with only two options (a)\nthe results of [1] are correct and in this case we need a revolution in\nMathematics (and also in Physics) or (b) the paper is a potpourri of nonsense.\nWe show that option (b) is the correct one. All `proofs' appearing in [1] are\ntrivially wrong, being based on a poor knowledge of advanced calculus notions.\nThere are many examples (some of them discussed in [2,3,4,5,6]of complete wrong\npapers using nonsequitur Mathematics in the Physics literature. Taking into\naccount also that a paper like [1] appeared in a Mathematics journal we think\nthat it is time for editors and referees of scientific journals to become more\ncareful in order to avoid the dissemination of nonsense.\n",

        "summary": "  We propose a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. We further\nextend the ideas used in this new linear programming algorithm for nonlinear\nprogramming problems. The new algorithm is based on the idea of treating the\nobjective function as a parameter. We form a matrix of coefficients, made-up of\nthe coefficients of the variables defined in the problem itself, and the\ncoefficients of variables defined newly, for converting inequalities into\nequations, namely, slack variables if it is the maximization problem, or,\nsurplus variables if it is the minimization problem. The system of equations we\nuse consist of the objective equation and equations obtained from inequalities\ndefining constraint imposed by the problem. We obtain reduced-row-echelon-form,\nR, for this matrix containing only one unknown, namely, the objective function\nitself as an unknown parameter, d, say. This matrix in the\nreduced-row-echelon-form contains columns (column vectors) corresponding to\nbasic variables and non-basic variables. If all the entries in the columns\ncorresponding to non-basic variables in R are already nonnegative then we will\nsee that we have almost reached to the solution and nothing much is left to be\ndone. If there are columns corresponding to non-basic variables which contain\nsome negative entries then we will require to apply suitable row\ntransformations, at most $m$ in number if there are m rows in R, as we will see\nbelow, to make all the entries in the columns corresponding to non-basic\nvariables nonnegative. We then proceed to show that the method developed above\nfor linear programming naturally extends to nonlinear programming problems. For\nnonlinear programming problems, we use the technique of Grobner bases, since\nGrobner basis is an equivalent of reduced row echelon form for a system of\nnonlinear equations.\n",

As per the important result due to Bass,\nConnell, and Wright [3] it is enough to show the validity of the Jacobian\nconjecture for cubic polynomials of special type (BCW form) in two, three, and\nn variables. Firstly, the method of proof for the cases of two and three\nvariables is discussed at length. It is then indicated that the extension to\nthe several variables case follows automatically by just following the same\nsteps and there is no hindrance as there is essentially no change in the basic\nsituation and the same line of thought used for the case of two and three\nvariables remains applicable. Thus, we show that the problem can be solved\ncompletely using the important reduction of the problem to the case of special\ncubic degree polynomials [3]. We have shown how to obtain inverse polynomials.\nWe fully obtain them for two variables case and almost obtain them for three\nvariables case.\n",

The conventional method of the generalized geometries construction,\nbased on a use of the topology, leads to a overdetermination of the Riemannian\ngeometry. In other words, at the Riemannian geometry construction one uses the\nneedless information (topology), which disagrees with other original axioms.\nThe crisis manifests in the fact, that the mathematical community cannot see\nand does not want to see the overdetermination of the Riemannian geometry. The\nmost geometers-topologists deny the alternative method of the generalized\ngeometry construction, which does not uses the topology, because it does not\ncontain theorems. Most geometers see the geometry presentation as a set of\ndefinitions and theorems. They cannot imagine the geometry presentation without\ncustomary theorems. As a result the most clever topologists, which have\nacknowledged the negligible role of the topology in the geometry construction\nand inconsistency of the conventional method of the generalized geometry\nconstruction, appear in the difficult situation (conflict with the mathematical\ncommunity).\n",

The main idea of the statistical convergence of a sequence l is that\nthe majority of elements from l converge and we do not care what is going on\nwith other elements. We show (Section 2) that being mathematically formalized\nthe concept of statistical convergence is directly connected to convergence of\nsuch statistical characteristics as the mean and standard deviation. At the\nsame time, it known that sequences that come from real life sources, such as\nmeasurement and computation, do not allow, in a general case, to test whether\nthey converge or statistically converge in the strict mathematical sense. To\novercome limitations induced by vagueness and uncertainty of real life data,\nneoclassical analysis has been developed. It extends the scope and results of\nthe classical mathematical analysis by applying fuzzy logic to conventional\nmathematical objects, such as functions, sequences, and series. The goal of\nthis work is the further development of neoclassical analysis. This allows us\nto reflect and model vagueness and uncertainty of our knowledge, which results\nfrom imprecision of measurement and inaccuracy of computation. In the context\non the theory of fuzzy limits, we develop the structure of statistical fuzzy\nconvergence and study its properties.\n",

Scenarios are\ndefined as strings of characters \"s\" (for \"spike\") and \"d\" (for \"down\") which\nsymbolize the Collatz operations (3m+1)/2 and m/2 in a Collatz Series\nconnecting two odd integers, the startnumber and the endnumber. It is shown\nthat a scenario determines uniquely four integers, called startperiod,\nstartphase, endperiod, and endphase such that startnumber = startperiod x k\nminus startphase, and endnumber = endperiod x k minus endphase, where k is any\nnatural number. Therefore, any scenario can be realized infinitely many times,\nwith well-defined startnumber and endnumber for each realization. It is shown\nhow the periods and phases for a given scenario are calculated. The results are\nused to prove that any odd (even) number in a Collatz Series is less than 8 (7)\n(\"up\"- or \"down\"-) steps away from an odd integer which is divisible by 3. They\nare also used for the construction of Collatz Series which exhibit prescribed\nregular graphics patterns.

They differ in the number of basic elements, from which the\ngeometrical objects are constructed. In E-representation there are three basic\nelements (point, segment, angle) and no additional structures. V-representation\ncontains two basic elements (point, vector) and additional structure: linear\nvector space. In sigma-representation there is only one basic element and\nadditional structure: world function \\sigma =\\rho^{2}/2, where \\rho is the\ndistance. The concept of distance appears in all representations. However, as a\nstructure, determining the geometry, the distance appears only in the\nsigma-representation. The sigma-representation is most appropriate for\nmodification of the proper Euclidean geometry. Practically any modification of\nthe proper Euclidean geometry turns it into multivariant geometry, where there\nare many vectors Q_0Q_1, Q_0Q_1^{\\prime},..., which are equal to the vector\nP_0P_1, but they are not equal between themselves, in general.

A variety of\nquasigroups(loops) that are not universal have been found to be isotopic\ninvariant relative to a special type of isotopism or the other. Presently,\nthere are two outstanding open problems on universality of loops: semi\nautomorphic inverse property loops(1999) and Osborn loops(2005). Smarandache\nisotopism(S-isotopism) was originally introduced by Vasantha Kandasamy in 2002.\nBut in this work, the concept is re-restructured in order to make it more\nexplorable. As a result of this, the theory of Smarandache isotopy inherits the\nopen problems as highlighted above for isotopy. In this short note, the\nquestion 'Under what type of S-isotopism will a pair of S-quasigroups(S-loops)\nform any variety?' is answered by presenting a pair of specially S-isotopic\nS-quasigroups(loops) that both belong to the same variety of\nS-quasigroups(S-loops). This is important because pairs of specially S-isotopic\nS-quasigroups(e.g Smarandache cross inverse property quasigroups) that are of\nthe same variety are useful for applications(e.g cryptography).\n",

This\nconnection is indicated by lines in the diagram of the Zeta Function, which are\nformed by the points s where the Zeta Function is real. Another key role in the\ndistribution of the prime numbers plays the number 5 and its periodic\noccurrence in the two number sequences SQ1 and SQ2.

These new algebraic properties, will open our eyes\nmore to the study of Osborn loops like CC-loops which has received a\ntremendious attention in this $21^\\textrm{st}$ and VD-loops whose study is yet\nto be explored. In this study, some algebraic properties of non-WIP Osborn\nloops have been investigated in a broad manner. Huthnance was able to deduce\nsome algebraic properties of Osborn loops with the WIP i.e universal weak\nWIPLs. So this work exempts the WIP. Two new loop identities, namely left self\ninverse property loop(LSIPL) identity and right self inverse property\nloop(RSLPL) are introduced for the first time and it is shown that in an Osborn\nloop, they are equivalent. A CC-loop is shown to be power associative if and\nonly if it is a RSLPL or LSIPL. Among the few identities that have been\nestablished for Osborn loops, one of them is recognized and recommended for\ncryptography in a similar spirit in which the cross inverse property has been\nused by Keedwell following the fact that it was observed that Osborn loops that\ndo not have the LSIP or RSIP or 3-PAPL or weaker forms of inverse property,\npower associativity and diassociativity to mention a few, will have cycles(even\nlong ones). These identity is called an Osborn cryptographic identity(or just a\ncryptographic identity).\n",

The Axioms of Separation, Replacement and Foundation are\nnot valid. All the other axioms of ZF are valid and all the basic sets, such as\ncomplement, intersection and cartesian product, exist although complement is\nnot quite the same set as in ZF. The set of all sets can be equipped with the\ntopology of approximations (Ta). Every set is closed and every function is\ncontinuous in Ta. This implies that the Continuum Hypothesis is false. The sets\ncontaining a subset which is perfect in Ta are of the greatest cardinality. A\nsimple observation shows that the concept of well-ordering must be defined in a\nslightly different way than in ZF. We prove that a set can be well-ordered if\nand only if it has no perfect subset. Therefore the cardinalities of arbitrary\nsets are always comparable without assuming the Axiom of Choice. The cardinals\nfollowing the smallest infinite cardinal w are 2w, 3w, ..., w^2, 2w^2, 3w^2,\n>..., w^3.... each being of greater cardinality than the previous one, which is\nnot the case in ZF. Immediately after these cardinals does not follow w^w which\nis not a well-orderable set but some well-ordered cardinal k, and this one is\nfollowed by the cardinals 2k, 3k, ..., k^2, 2k^2, 3k^2, ..., k^3...., etc. The\ngreatest cardinal is P(w) and is not a well-orderable set.

This discovery is also\nincidentally along the lines of Bombieri \\cite[page 123, lines\n12--14]{Bombieri2}. Another miracle in the argument is the simultaneous\nappearances of four integrals in the evaluation of traces. These four integrals\nall together made it possible to cancel all unwanted integration variables in\nevaluating traces of the operator on the two subspaces. We also used the\ndisjoint decomposition of $J_S$ and the positivity of the convolution operator\nto prove that the trace of the integral operator on the second subspace is\nnonnegative. It follows that the integral operator has nonnegative trace on the\n$L^2$ space. This proves the positivity of Li's criterion \\cite{Bombieri1}.

        "summary": "  In this book, the authors introduce the notion of Super linear algebra and\nsuper vector spaces using the definition of super matrices defined by Horst\n(1963). This book expects the readers to be well-versed in linear algebra. Many\ntheorems on super linear algebra and its properties are proved. Some theorems\nare left as exercises for the reader. These new class of super linear algebras\nwhich can be thought of as a set of linear algebras, following a stipulated\ncondition, will find applications in several fields using computers. The\nauthors feel that such a paradigm shift is essential in this computerized\nworld. Some other structures ought to replace linear algebras which are over a\ncentury old. Super linear algebras that use super matrices can store data not\nonly in a block but in multiple blocks so it is certainly more powerful than\nthe usual matrices. This book has 3 chapters. Chapter one introduces the notion\nof super vector spaces and enumerates a number of properties. Chapter two\ndefines the notion of super linear algebra, super inner product spaces and\nsuper bilinear forms. Several interesting properties are derived. The main\napplication of these new structures in Markov chains and Leontief economic\nmodels are also given in this chapter. The final chapter suggests 161 problems\nmainly to make the reader understand this new concept and apply them.\n",

We prove that the\nRiemann hypothesis is valid under the assumptions of the explicit strong\ndensity hypothesis and the Lindel\\\"of hypothesis recently proven, via a result\nof the implication on the zero free regions from the remainder terms of the\nprime number theorem by the power sum method of Tur\\'an.\n",

        "summary": "  The Riemann hypothesis, conjectured by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, claims that\nthe non-trivial zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ lie on the line $\\Re(s) =1/2$. The density\nhypothesis is a conjectured estimate $N(\\lambda, T) =O\\bigl(T\\sp{2(1-\\lambda)\n+\\epsilon} \\bigr)$ for any $\\epsilon >0$, where $N(\\lambda, T)$ is the number\nof zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ when $\\Re(s) \\ge\\lambda$ and $0 <\\Im(s) \\le T$, with\n$1/2 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$ and $T >0$. The Riemann-von Mangoldt Theorem confirms\nthis estimate when $\\lambda =1/2$, with $T\\sp{\\epsilon}$ being replaced by\n$\\log T$. In an attempt to transform Backlund's proof of the Riemann-von\nMangoldt Theorem to a proof of the density hypothesis by convexity, we\ndiscovered a different approach utilizing an auxiliary function. The crucial\npoint is that this function should be devised to be symmetric with respect to\n$\\Re(s) =1/2$ and about the size of the Euler Gamma function on the right hand\nside of the line $\\Re(s) =1/2$. Moreover, it should be analytic and without any\nzeros in the concerned region. We indeed found such a function, which we call\npseudo-Gamma function. With its help, we are able to establish a proof of the\ndensity hypothesis. Actually, we give the result explicitly and our result is\neven stronger than the original density hypothesis, namely it yields\n$N(\\lambda, T) \\le 8.734 \\log T$ for any $1/2 < \\lambda < 1$ and $T\\ge\n2445999554999$.\n",

In case of n-linear\nalgebra of type II we are in a position to define linear functionals which is\none of the marked difference between the n-vector spaces of type I and II.\nHowever all the applications mentioned in n-linear algebras of type I can be\nappropriately extended to n-linear algebras of type II.

This\nbook has three chapters. In the first chapter the notion of n-vector spaces of\ntype II are introduced. This chapter gives over 50 theorems.

But, his Number-Theoretical achievements\n(See Books 7, 8 and 9 in his magnum opus \\emph{Elements} [1]) are rarely\nspoken. The object of this paper is to affirm the number-theoretical role of\nEuclid and the historical significance of Euclid's algorithm. It is known that\nalmost all elementary number-theoretical texts begin with Division algorithm.\nHowever, Euclid did not do like this. He began his number-theoretical work by\nintroducing his algorithm. We were quite surprised when we began to read the\n\\emph{Elements} for the first time. Nevertheless, one can prove that Euclid's\nalgorithm is essentially equivalent with the Bezout's equation and Division\nalgorithm. Therefore, Euclid has preliminarily established Theory of\nDivisibility and the greatest common divisor. This is the foundation of Number\nTheory. After more than 2000 years, by creatively introducing the notion of\ncongruence, Gauss published his \\emph{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae} in 1801 and\ndeveloped Number Theory as a systematic science. Note also that Euclid's\nalgorithm implies Euclid's first theorem (which is the heart of `the uniqueness\npart' of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic) and Euclid's second theorem\n(which states that there are infinitely many primes). Thus, in the nature of\nthings, Euclid's algorithm is the most important number-theoretical work of\nEuclid. For this reason, we further summarize briefly the influence of Euclid's\nalgorithm. Knuth said `we might call Euclid's method the granddaddy of all\nalgorithms'. Based on our discussion and analysis, it leads to the conclusion\nEuclid's algorithm is the greatest number-theoretical achievement of the\nEuclidean age.\n",

A weakened form of this conjecture states that for every\n$k\\geq1$, there exist infinitely many primes $p$ and $q$ such that $p-q=2k$.\nClearly, the weakened form of Polignac's conjecture implies that there exists\nan infinite sequence of positive integers $x_1,x_2,...,x_m,...$ such that $x_1\n(2k+x_1),x_2 (2k+x_2),...,x_m (2k+x_m)...$ are pairwise relatively prime. In\nthis note, we obtain a slightly stronger result than this necessary condition.\nThis enables us to find a common property on some special kinds of\nnumber-theoretic functions (such as $2^x -1 $) which likely represent\ninfinitely many primes by rich literatures and a lot of research reports.\nHowever, the function $2^{2^x}+1$ does not have this property.

Our method is quite different than the known approaches\nand it rely on the operation of opening disjoint chambers, bu using\nspiral-chain like movement of the outer-cycle elastic-sticky edges of the cubic\nplanar graph. In fact we have shown that in hamiltonicity of Barnette graph a\nsingle-chamber or double-chamber with a bridge face is enough to transform the\nproblem into finding specific hamiltonian path in the cubic bipartite graph\nreduced. In the last part of the paper we have demonstrated that, if the given\ncubic planar graph is non-hamiltonian then the algorithm which constructs\nspiral-chain (or double-spiral chain) like chamber shows that except one vertex\nthere exists (n-1)-vertex cycle.\n",

Several properties for\ndivergent series and explicit formulas for sums of some infinite series are\nestablished. A number of finite and new recurrence formulas for Bernoulli\nnumbers are obtained.

It is well known the when b^2-4ac>0, equation (1)\ndescribes either a hyperbola on the plane or a pair of two straight lines(the\ndegenerate case). The key integer is the number, I=k^2(d^2-4af)-(2ae-bd)^2.

Thus, when I is not zero,\nequation (1) has only finitely many integer solutions (x,y). The process of\nfinding these solutions is outlined in Section 3.

The question was then, whether there existed\na digit d and a positive integer k(other than the above); such that d^k is the\nleglength of a Pythagorean triangle whose hypotenuse length has exactly k\ndigits, each being equal to d. In 1999, F.Luca and P.Bruckman, answered the\nabove question in the negative. In 2001, K.Zelator(see [2]), took this question\nfurther and showed that no Pythagorean triangle exists such that one leg has\nlength d^k, while the other leglegth has exactly k digits in its decimal\nexpansion, with each digit bein equal to d. In this work, we explore the above\nphenomenon from the point of view of number bases other than 10. We prove five\nTheorems. As an example, in Theorem 1, we prove that there exists no\nPythagorean triangle with one of its leglengths being d^k, while the other\nleglength having exactly k digits in its base 4 expansion; and with digit being\nequal to d.\n",

Such a dramatically limiting and\nthus harmful belief comes, unknown to equally many, from the similarly tacit\nacceptance of the ancient Archimedean Axiom in Euclid's Geometry. The\nconsequence of that belief is a similar belief in the uniqueness of the field\n$\\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, and therefore, of the various spaces,\nmanifolds, etc., be they finite or infinite dimensional, constructed upon the\nreal or complex numbers, including the Hilbert spaces used in Quantum\nMechanics. An near total lack of awareness follows about the {\\it rich\nself-similar} structure of various linearly ordered scalar fields obtained\nthrough the {\\it ultrapower} construction which extend the usual field\n$\\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers. Such {\\it ultrapower field} extensions contain as\na rather small subset the usual field $\\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers. The rich\nself-similar structure of such field extensions is due to {\\it infinitesimals},\nand thus also of {\\it infinitely large} elements in such fields, which make\nsuch fields {\\it non-Archimedean}. With the concept of {\\it walkable world},\nwhich has highly intuitive and pragmatic algebraic and geometric meaning, the\nmentioned rich self-similar structure is illustrated. The ultrapower fields\npresented can have a wide ranging relevance in Physics, among others, for a\nproper treatment of what are usually called the \"infinities in Physics\". The\nultrapower construction which gives such non-Archimedean fields is rather\nsimple and elementary, requiring only 101 Algebra.\n",

A non-archimedean absolute value is introduced in $C$\nexploiting the concept of {\\em relative} infinitesimals and a scale invariant\nultrametric valuation of the form $\\log_{\\varepsilon^{-1}} (\\varepsilon/x) $\nfor a given scale $\\varepsilon>0$ and infinitesimals $0<x<\\varepsilon, x\\in\nI\\backslash C$. Using this new absolute value, a valued (metric) measure is\ndefined on $C $ and is shown to be equal to the finite Hausdorff measure of the\nset, if it exists. The formulation of a scale invariant real analysis is also\noutlined, when the singleton $\\{0\\}$ of the real line $R$ is replaced by a zero\nmeasure Cantor set. The Cantor function is realised as a locally constant\nfunction in this setting. The ordinary derivative $dx/dt$ in $R$ is replaced by\nthe scale invariant logarithmic derivative $d\\log x/d\\log t$ on the set of\nvalued infinitesimals. As a result, the ordinary real valued functions are\nexpected to enjoy some novel asymptotic properties, which might have important\napplications in number theory and in other areas of mathematics.\n",

These results lead to a Theorem of the Continuum that supersedes Cantor's\nContinuum Hypothesis and establishes the countable nature of the real number\nline, suggesting that all infinite sets are denumerable. Some immediate\nimplications of denumerability are discussed: i) Valid proofs should not\ninclude inconceivable statements, defined as statements that can be found to be\nfalse and always lead to contradiction. This is formalized in a Principle of\nConceivable Proof. ii) Substantial simplification of the axiomatic principles\nof set theory can be achieved by excluding transfinite numbers. To facilitate\nthe comparison of sets, infinite as well as finite, the concept of relative\ncardinality is introduced. iii) Proofs of incompleteness that use diagonal\narguments (e.g. those used in Godel's Theorems) are refuted. A constructive\nproof, based on the denumerability of P(N), is presented to demonstrate the\nexistence of a theory of first-order arithmetic that is consistent, sound,\nnegation-complete, decidable and (assumed p.r. adequate) able to prove its own\nconsistency.

It has been known, since Riemann's memoir in 1860, that\nthe distribution of prime numbers can be described by the zero-free region of\nthe Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$. This function has infinitely many zeros\nand a unique pole at $s = 1$. Those zeros at $s = -2, -4, -6, ...$ are known as\ntrivial zeros. The nontrivial zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ are all located in the\nso-called critical strip $0<\\Re(s) <1$.

The latter concerns how a\nhuman intelligence computes the values of number-theoretic functions, and is\nformalised by the operations of a Turing Machine following Turing's analysis of\ncomputable functions. I shall show that such a bridge requires objective\ndefinitions of both an `algorithmic' interpretation of PA, and an\n`instantiational' interpretation of PA. I shall show that both interpretations\nare implicit in the definition of the subjectively defined `standard'\ninterpretation of PA. However the existence of, and distinction between, the\ntwo objectively definable interpretations---and the fact that the former is\nsound whilst the latter is not---is obscured by the extraneous presumption\nunder the `standard' interpretation of PA that Aristotle's particularisation\nmust hold over the structure N of the natural numbers. I shall argue that\nrecognising the falseness of this belief awaits a paradigm shift in our\nperception of the application of Tarski's analysis (of the concept of truth in\nthe languages of the deductive sciences) to the `standard' interpretation of\nPA. I shall then show that an arithmetical formula [F] is PA-provable if, and\nonly if, [F] interprets as true under an algorithmic interpretation of PA. I\nshall finally show how it then follows from Goedel's construction of a formally\n`undecidable' arithmetical proposition that there is a Halting-type PA formula\nwhich---by Tarski's definitions---is algorithmically verifiable as true, but\nnot algorithmically computable as true, under a sound interpretation of PA.\n",

The properties of closed\nexterior and dual forms, namely, invariance, covariance, conjugacy and duality,\neither explicitly or implicitly appear in all invariant mathematical\nformalisms.

However, the theory of closed exterior forms cannot be\ncompleted without an answer to a question of how the closed exterior forms\nemerge. In the present paper we discus essentially new skew-symmetric forms,\nwhich generate closed exterior forms.

Given a Pythagorean\ntriangle BCA, with the right angle at C, let P be a point on the hupotenuse BA;\nand let D and E be the perpendicular projections of the point P onto the sides\nBC and CA respectively.When is either of the right triangles BDP and PEA\nPythagorean? As it turns out, according to Theorem1, they are either both\nPythagorean, or neither of them is.When they are both Pythagorean,a complete\nparametric description of these two triangles is given; in terms of the\nparameters that describe the Pythagorean triangle BCA. Later in the paper, we\noffer a complete analysis of three special cases:the case wherein the point P\nis the midpoint M of the hypotenuse BA; the case when P is the foot I of the 90\ndegree angle bisector;and the case in ehich the point P is the foot F of the\nperpendicular drawn from the vertex C to the hypotenuse. After that, some other\ncases are investigated as well.Specifically, we consider the case in which not\nonly the triangles BDP and PEA are Pythagorean;but the four congruent right\ntriangles DCP,DEP,DCE,and CEP,are Pythagorean as well.Precise conditions in\norder for this to occur, are given in Theorem7. Also,in Theorem 2, part(i), we\nshow that if the triangle BCA is a primitive Pythagorean triangle, there exists\nno point P along the hypotenuse BA, for which both right triangles BDP and PEA\nare Pythagorean.\n",

One of such misconceptions\nis related to arithmetic of natural numbers, which is extremely important both\nfor science and everyday life. People think their counting is governed by the\nrules of the conventional arithmetic and thus other kinds of arithmetics of\nnatural numbers do not exist and cannot exist. However, this popular image of\nthe situation with the natural numbers is wrong. In many situations, people\nhave to utilize and do implicitly utilize rules of counting and operating\ndifferent from rules and operations in the conventional arithmetic. This is a\nconsequence of the existing diversity in nature and society. To correctly\nrepresent this diversity, people have to explicitly employ different\narithmetics. To make a distinction, we call the conventional arithmetic by the\nname Diophantine arithmetic, while other arithmetics are called\nnon-Diophantine. There are two big families of non-Diophantine arithmetics:\nprojective arithmetics and dual arithmetics (Burgin, 1997). In this work, we\ngive an exposition of projective arithmetics, presenting their properties and\nconsidering also a more general mathematical structure called a projective\nprearithmetic. The Diophantine arithmetic is a member of this parametric\nfamily: its parameter is equal to the identity function f(x) = x. In\nconclusion, it is demonstrated how non-Diophantine arithmetics may be utilized\nbeyond mathematics and how they allow one to eliminate inconsistencies and\ncontradictions encountered by other researchers.\n",

A basic initial feature is that AP\nTheory, as a whole, is already, ab initio, a universal canonical 2D\nsigma-model, targeting smooth, compact, simply-connected 4-manifolds with a\nconnected boundary, and its topological Planckian quantum starting point, as\nwell as its cone-like, infinitely-generated at each stage, graded group of\nhomology-preserving, but topology-changing transitions/interactions, exhibit\nthe most general qualitative S-duality. We first point out the numerous\nmathematically rigorous, model-free, (i.e., intrinsic), topological AP\nanalogues with the heuristic Kapustin-Witten version of Geometric Langlands\ntheory, as well as the crucial differences between the two theories. The latter\nhave to exist since AP Theory deals, a priori, essentially only with discrete\ngroup-theoretic presentation theory, not Lie group representation theory, not\nwith category nor moduli theory, does not need classical SUSY, nor Feynman\nintegrals, lattice models, etc., and furthermore is model-independent and\ncharacteristic of real dimension four. It will become clear that AP Langlands\ntheory is a model-independent, cone-like, graded, compact completion and\ntopological 'envelope' of 4D N=4 SUSY YM theory, their starting point,\nanchored, kept in place, so to speak, by a purely discrete group-theoretic\nanalogue of Donaldson/Seiberg-Witten theory. Due to its discrete\ngroup-theoretic conceptual simplicity and universality, the AP Langlands\nprogram should also be considered to be a new type of intrinsic model-free\nsymmetry, a universal Erlanger Program for Modern Physics.\n",

Similarly, when\nthe radius of the inscribed circle is taken into account, r=b(a-b), a third\nbinary quadratic form is found, namely (x+y)-4r=z-2r=(a-b)^2+2b^2. The three\nquadratic representations accommodate positive integers whose factorizations\ncan only include primes p represented by the same type of binary quadratic\nforms, i.e. p=1,5(mod8), p=1,7(mod8), and p=1,3(mod8), respectively. For all\nthree types of binary quadratic forms, when the positive integers represented\nare prime, such representations are unique.

In the first chapter interval bistructures\n(biinterval structures) such as interval bisemigroup, interval bigroupoid,\ninterval bigroup and interval biloops are introduced. Throughout this book we\nwork only with the intervals of the form [0, a] where a \\in Zn or Z+ \\cup {0}\nor R+ \\cup {0} or Q+ \\cup {0} unless otherwise specified. Also interval\nbistructures of the form interval loop-group, interval groupgroupoid so on are\nintroduced and studied. In chapter two n-interval structures are introduced.\nn-interval groupoids, n-interval semigroups, n-interval loops and so on are\nintroduced and analysed. Using these notions n-interval mixed algebraic\nstructure are defined and described. Some probable applications are discussed.\nOnly in due course of time several applications would be evolved by researchers\nas per their need. The final chapter suggests around 295 problems of which some\nare simple exercises, some are difficult and some of them are research\nproblems.\n",

We show that the\nclassical Standard interpretation I_PA(N, Standard) of PA essentially defines\nthe satisfaction and truth of the formulas of the first-order Peano Arithmetic\nPA in terms of algorithmic verifiability. It is accepted that this classical\ninterpretation---in terms of algorithmic verifiabilty---cannot lay claim to be\nfinitary; it does not lead to a finitary justification of the Axiom Schema of\nFinite Induction of PA from which we may conclude---in an intuitionistically\nunobjectionable manner---that PA is consistent. We now show that the\nPA-axioms---including the Axiom Schema of Finite Induction---are, however,\nalgorithmically computable finitarily as satisfied / true under the Standard\ninterpretation I_PA(N, Standard) of PA; and that the PA rules of inference do\npreserve algorithmically computable satisfiability / truth finitarily under the\nStandard interpretation I_PA(N, Standard). We conclude that the algorithmically\ncomputable PA-formulas can provide a finitary interpretation I_PA(N,\nAlgorithmic) of PA from which we may classically conclude that PA is consistent\nin an intuitionistically unobjectionable manner. We define this interpretation,\nand show that if the associated logic is interpreted finitarily then (i) PA is\ncategorical and (ii) Goedel's Theorem VI holds vacuously in PA since PA is\nconsistent but not omega-consistent.\n",

As\na result of the proposed Probabilistic Arithmetic operations, variable values,\ndegrees of their accuracy and correlations are refined.\n  Probabilistic Generalized Addition (PGA) and Probabilistic Generalized\nMultiplication (PGM) operations on correlated random variables are defined and\ntheir basic properties identified and described: \\bullet Proposed PGA and PGM\noperations possess inverse operations - subtraction and division. \\bullet There\nis no difference between direct and inverse operations: addition and\nsubtraction, multiplication and division (this is why these operations are\ncalled \"Generalized\"). \\bullet Division by approximately zero is possible and\nthe result never equals to \\infty, making this approach promising in\ncomputational and computer mathematics. \\bullet Unlike the usual hyperbola,\nwhich, when the argument is changing from + \\infty to 0, has a gap at 0, the\nGeneralized Probabilistic Hyperbola, under certain combination of initial\naccuracies, is continuous at 0. First, as the argument changes from +\\infty to\n0, it behaves like a typical hyperbola, monotonically increasing. However,\nafter reaching certain maximum value, it starts to decrease to 0 monotonically.\nLast property gives a hope that the proposed approach might be promising in\nQuantum Physics, as it would allow a more adequate description of macro and\nmicro physics, as well as of the transition from one to the other.\n",

For the first equation, with n being an\nodd positive integer, they give the solution x=(n+1)/2, y=n(n+1)/2. For the\nsecond equation they present the particular solution, x=(n+1)/3,y=n(n+1)/3,\nwhere is n is a positive integer congruent to 2modulo3. If in the above\nequations we assume n to be prime, then these two equations become special\ncases of the diophantine equation, nxy=p(x+y) (1), with p being a prime and n a\npositive integer greater than or equal to 2. This 2-variable symmetric\ndiophantine equation is the subject matter of this article; with the added\ncondition that the intager n is not divisible by the prime p. Observe that this\nequation can be written in fraction form: n/p= 1/x + 1/y(See [2] for more\ndetails)\n  In this work we prove the following result, Theorem1(stated on page2 of this\npaper):Let p be a prime, n a positive integer at least2, and not divisible by\np. Then, 1)If n=2 and p is an odd prime, equation (1) has exactly three\ndistinct positive integer solutions:x=p, y=p ; x=p(p+1)/2, y=(p+1)/2 ;\nx=(p+1)/2, y=p(p+1)/2 2)If n is greater than or equal to 3, and n is a divisor\nof p+1.

In particular, nonlinear quantum\npropagators with non-zero defect quantum electric-charge, are interpreted as\n{\\em exotic-quantum supergravity} effects. As an application, the recently\ndiscovered bound-state called $Zc(3900)$, is obtained as a neutral\nquasi-particle, generated in a $Q$-quantum exotic supergravity process. {\\em\nQuantum entanglement} is justified by means of the algebraic topologic\nstructure of nonlinear quantum propagators.

In a 1976\narticle by Wynne William Wilson in the Mathematical Gazette(see reference[2]),\nthe author showed that angleB is twice angleA, if and only if b^2=a(a+c). We\noffer our own proof of this result in Proposition1.Using Proposition1 and\nLemma2, we establish Proposition 2: Let a,b,c be positive reals. Then a\ntriangle ABC having a,b,c as its sidelengths can be formed if,and onlyif,\nb^2=a(a+c) and either c<(or equal to)a; or alternatively a<c<3a. Now, consider\nthe case of integral triangles, that is; a,b, and c bieng positive integers.In\n2002, in a paper published in the Mathematical Gazette(see[2]), author\nM.N.Deshpande provided two-parameter formulas that describe some integral\ntriangles with (angle)B=2(angle)A. In Result2 in Section5, we offer 3-parameter\nformulas that describe the entire family of integral triangles ABC with\nangleA=2angleB. Using Result1, we then parametrically describe the entire\nfamily of integral triangles with angle A=2angleB; and with the bisector of\nangleB also of integral length. This is done in Reult2 in Section6. In\nSection7, we conclude this article with two closing remarks.\n",

The crucial progress is\nto find that $\\zeta(s)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of polynomials\nof infinite degree, whose consequences are shown in several aspects: (i)\nnumerically it provides a scenario to construct very fast convergent algorithm\nto calculate $\\zeta(s)$; (ii) interestingly it shows that Lagrange\ninterpolation using infinite number of integer Euler zeta functions reproduces\nthe exact complex $\\zeta(s)$; (iii) surprisingly it demonstrates that\nalternating Riemann zeta function (or other entire functions removing the pole\nof zeta function) is admissible to Melzak combinatorial transform for\npolynomials. Applying the functional symmetry on $\\zeta(s)$ in the form of\nMelzak transform induces $\\zeta(s)$ being written as the difference of two\nsymmetrized factorials whose zeros are proved to all have real part of 1/2.\nFurthermore, the two symmetrized factorials are proved to have interlacing\nbetween the two sequences of the imaginary part of their zeros on upper (or\nlower) half plane, which ensures the difference of the two symmetrized\nfactorials [proportional to $\\zeta(s)$] attaining the same feature of zeros\nwith real part of 1/2 to endorse Riemann hypothesis.\n",

The generalized\nmeasurement has application backgrounds such as a generalized problem in\ndimension reduction, and has reasons from the existence of the minimum of both\nthe positive size and the positive graduation, i.e., both the minimum is the\nsize of the set ${0}$. The minimum of positive graduation in actual measurement\nprovides the possibility that an object cannot be partitioned arbitrarily,\ne.g., an interval $[0, 1]$ cannot be partitioned by arbitrarily infinite times\nto keep compatible with the minimum of positive size. For the measurement on\nsize of set, it can be assumed that this minimum is the size of ${0}$, in\nsymbols $|{0}|$ or graduation 1. For a set $S$, we generalize any graduation as\nthe size of a set $C_i$ where $\\exists x \\in S (x \\in C_i)$, and $|S|$ is\nrepresented by a pair, in symbols $(C, N(C))$, where ${C} = \\cup {C_i}$ and\n$N(C)$ is a set function on $C_i$, with $C_i$ independent of the order $i$ and\n$N(C)$ reflecting the quantity of $C_i$. This pair is a generalized form of\nbox-counting dimension. The yielded size satisfies the properties of outer\nmeasure in general cases, and satisfies the properties of measure in the case\nof graduation 1; while in the reverse view, measure is a size using the\ngraduation of size of an interval. As for cardinality, the yielded size is a\none-to-one correspondence where only addition is allowable, a weak form of\ncardinality, and rewrites Continuum Hypothesis using dimension as $\\omega \\dot\n|{0,1}| = 1$. In the reverse view, cardinality of a set is a size in the\ngraduation of the set. The generalized measurement provides a unified approach\nto dimension, measure, cardinality and hence infinity.\n",

Here it is\nshown that the property of closure of coset groups can be used to generate the\nbasis and general multiplication rules for extensions of real numbers in a\nsystematic way. The coset approach has the advantage that multiplication rules\nfollow directly from group closure instead of being postulated. In this\napproach, constraints on multiplication parameters can be formulated in ways\nthat capture the symmetry features of the coset group. A complete\nclassification of numbers systems is therefore obtained based on possible group\nstructures of a given order. General matrix representations are also obtained\nthrough the coset procedure and by construction, the form of these matrices is\ninvariant under matrix addition and multiplication. Since group symmetries are\ncaptured naturally into each number system, the coset group approach can add\ninsight into the utility of multidimensional number systems in describing\nsymmetries in nature.\n",

Proposition1 is proved with the aid of Euclid's\nlemma and another well known result in number theory; see reference [1].In\nSections3 and4, we focus on the special case b^2-4c=0; which implies b=2d and\nc=d^2, for some integer d.

Theorem1 in\nSec.5 deals with the general case.Accordingly, if a^2-ab+c is not zero; there\nare exactly 4N distinct integral points parametrically described.Except in the\ncases where a^2-ab+c is a perfect square, or minus a perfect square; in which\ncases thare are exactly 4N-2 distinct integral points.

The objective of this article is to define and describe the\nessential tools of Jassologic process, wich consists in associating a word,\ncalled Jassologic Word, to a planar trivalent rooted map. The original method\nis based on breaking down a map into layers of cells called \"Jasses\", which\nmeans \"layers\" in Provence. We also describe in details the set of Jassologic\nWords, whose alphabet is composed of 16 specified caracters (Catherine Mouet's\ncaracters). And we explain how to construct a planar trivalent rooted map from\nany Jassologic Word. We obtain a bijection between Jassologic Words and the\nequivalence classes of planar trivalent rooted maps. In particular, two planar\ntrivalent rooted maps are equivalent if and only if their correspondant\nJassologic Words are the same. From a computer science point of view,\nJassologic process is an algorithm which doesn't use any handling of images.\n",

In this paper we first propose a limit\ndefinition of a function whose values coincide everywhere with those of the\nRiemann zeta function, save in 1, where our limit definition yields the Euler\nconstant. Since in the literature one can find more than one way to regularize\nthe value of the zeta function at s=1, we give asymptotic expansions where, by\ndint of some extended analogies, Euler constant appears to be the true\n\"renormalized\" value. As a striking example of such analogies, we propose an\nexpansion of the logarithm function based on Euler constant and on all values\nof the zeta function at odd positive integers, in which all these presumably\nirrational numbers are accompanied by Harmonic numbers of corresponding orders.\nThe other aim of this paper is to show how sequences of rationals, often the\nsame, arise in computations related to Dirichlet L-functions.

The mostly used methods are Euler,\nRiemann-Liouville and Caputo which are fractional order derivatives. The\napplications of these methods to constant and identity functions will be given\nin this study. Obtained results demonstrated that all of three methods have\nerrors and deficiencies. In fact, the obtained results demonstrated that the\nmethods given as fractional order derivatives are curve fitting methods or\ncurve approximation methods. In this paper, we redefined fractional order\nderivative (FOD) by using classical derivative definition and L Hospital\nmethod, since classical derivative definition concluded in indefinite limit\nsuch as 0/0. The obtained definition is same as classical derivative definition\nin case of fractional order is equal to 1.

The properties of FOD for positive monotonic increasing/decreasing\nfunctions were demonstrated in this paper.

If you think of crotons\nas linear combinations, then the scalars used are croton base numbers. Croton\nbase numbers can be combined to form the amplitudes and phases of Mersenne\nfluctuations which, in turn, form qphyla. Volume normally requires space or\nspace-time as a prerequisite; in a pregeometric setting, however, \"volume\" is\nrepresented by a qphyletic assembly. Various stages of pre-geometric\nrefinement, expressed through the aspects crotonic amplitude or phase, combine\nto eventually form and/or dissolve sphere-packed chunks of Euclidean space. A\ntime-like crotonic refinement is a rough analog of temporal resolution in\ntenacious time, whereas space-like crotonic refinement is analogous to spatial\nresolution in sustained space. The analogy suggests a conceptual link between\nthe ever-expanding scope of Mersenne fluctuations and the creation and lifetime\npatterns of massive elementary particles. A three-stage process of ideation,\norganization and intraworldly action is introduced to back this up. In Part II,\nthe intrawordly aspect is analyzed first, including our preon model of\nsubnuclear structure, and the organizer aspect thereafter, based on three types\nof Mersenne numbers, $M_{\\textrm{reg}}$, $M_{5/8}$, $M_{9/8}$, and two formal\nprinciples: juxtaposition $x$ vs. $\\! x\\!\\pm\\!1(2)$ and the interordinal\napplication of functional\n$1\\!\\divideontimes(f^{(a)}\\!\\circ(f^{(b)}\\!\\divideontimes f^{(c)}))$.\n",

This is achieved based on a rigorous\naccount of quaternion differentiability, the proposed I-gradient, and the use\nof augmented quaternion statistics to account for real world data with\nnoncircular probability distributions. We first provide an elegant solution for\nthe calculation of the gradient of real functions of quaternion variables\n(typical cost function), an issue that has so far prevented systematic\ndevelopment of quaternion adaptive filters. This makes it possible to unify the\nclass of existing and proposed quaternion least mean square (QLMS) algorithms,\nand to illuminate their structural similarity. Next, in order to cater for both\ncircular and noncircular data, the class of widely linear QLMS (WL-QLMS)\nalgorithms is introduced and the subsequent convergence analysis unifies the\ntreatment of strictly linear and widely linear filters, for both proper and\nimproper sources. It is also shown that the proposed class of HR gradients\nallows us to resolve the uncertainty owing to the noncommutativity of\nquaternion products, while the involution gradient (I-gradient) provides\ngeneric extensions of the corresponding real- and complex-valued adaptive\nalgorithms, at a reduced computational cost. Simulations in both the strictly\nlinear and widely linear setting support the approach.\n",

The first counterexample forces Cantor's Diagonal\nMethod (DM) to yield one of the numbers in the target list. To study this\nanomaly, and given that for the DM to work the list of numbers have to be\nwritten down, the set of numbers that can be represented using positional\nfractional notation, $\\mathbb{W}$, is properly characterized. It is then shown\nthat $\\mathbb{W}$ is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, meaning that results\nobtained from the application of the DM to $\\mathbb{W}$ in order to derive\nproperties of $\\mathbb{R}$ are not valid. It is then shown that Cantor's DM for\na generic list of reals can be forced to yield one of the numbers of the list,\nthus invalidating Cantor's result that infers the non-denumerability of\n$\\mathbb{R}$ from the application of the DM to $\\mathbb{W}$. Cantor's Theorem\nabout the different cardinalities of a set and its power set is then\nquestioned, and by means of another counterexample we show that the theorem\ndoes not actually hold for infinite sets. After analyzing all these results, it\nis shown that the current notion of cardinality for infinite sets does not\ndepend on the size of the sets, but rather on the representation chosen for\nthem. Following this line of thought, the concept of model as a framework for\nthe construction of the representation of a set is introduced, and a theorem\nshowing that an infinite set can be well-ordered if there is a proper model for\nit is proven. To reiterate that the cardinality of a set does not determine\nwhether the set can be well-ordered, a set of cardinality\n$\\aleph_{0}^{\\aleph_{0}}$ is proven to be equipollent to the set of natural\nnumbers $\\mathbb{N}$. The paper concludes with an analysis of the cardinality\nof the ordinal numbers, for which a representation of cardinality\n$\\aleph_{0}^{\\aleph_{0}}$ is proposed.\n",

We give the expression of one operator\nthat yields the integral operator and derivative operators of the function f at\nany s-order. For s positive integer real number, we obtain the ordinary\ns-iterated integral of f. For s negative integer real number we obtain the\n|s|-order ordinary derivatives of f. Any s positive real or positive real part\nof s complex number corresponds to s-integral operator of f. Any s negative\nreal number or negative real part of s complex number corresponds to |s|-order\nderivative operator of f. The results are applied for f being a monom. And\nremarkable relations concerning the e and {\\pi} order integrals and e and {\\pi}\norder derivatives are given, for e and {\\pi} transcendental numbers. Similar\nresults may also be obtained for anticausal functions. For particular values of\na and s, the operator gives exactly Liouville fractional integral, Riemann\nfractional integral, Caputo fractional derivative, Liouville-Caputo fractional\nderivative. Finally, the new operator is neither integral nor derivative\noperator. It is integral and derivative operators at the same time. It deserves\nof being named:raoelinian operator is proposed.\n",

This paper shows how the universals of category theory in mathematics\nprovide a model (in the Platonic Heaven of mathematics) for the\nself-predicative strand of Plato's Theory of Forms as well as for the idea of a\n\"concrete universal\" in Hegel and similar ideas of paradigmatic exemplars in\nordinary thought. 2. The paper also shows how the always-self-predicative\nuniversals of category theory provide the \"opposite bookend\" to the\nnever-self-predicative universals of iterative set theory and thus that the\nparadoxes arose from having one theory (e.g., Frege's Paradise) where\nuniversals could be either self-predicative or non-self-predicative (instead of\nbeing always one or the other). 3. Moreover the paper considers one of the most\nimportant examples of self-predicative universals in pure mathematics, namely\nadjoint functors or adjunctions. It gives a parsing of adjunctions into two\nhalves (left and right semi-adjunctions) using the heterodox notion of\nheteromorphisms, and then shows that the parts can be recombined in a new way\nto define the cognate-to-adjoints notion of a brain functor that provides an\nabstract conceptual model of a brain. 4. Finally the paper argues that at least\none way category theory has foundational relevance is that it isolates the\nuniversal concepts and structures that are important throughout mathematics.\n",

To study the geometry of the set of square roots of\n$\\pm I_2$ we consider a slightly more general set of square matrices of order\n$2$ and show that these sets are hyperboloids of one sheet or hyperboloids of\ntwo sheets. From these general results we conclude that the set of involutory\nmatrices of order 2 is a hyperboloid of one sheet and the set of\nskew-involutory matrices of order 2 is a hyperboloid of two sheets. The\nrelations between the geometrical properties of the hyperboloids and the set of\nsquare roots of $I_2$ are also investigated. We then proceed to obtain the\nforms of the involutory matrices of order 2 by more advanced methods. We have\nconsidered two approaches: in the first approach we use the concept of a\nfunction of a matrix and in the second approach we use concepts of\nsplit-quaternions.\n",

However, in engineering problems,\nfunctions of interest are often real-valued and thus not analytic, such as the\nstandard cost function. The HR calculus is a convenient way to calculate formal\nderivatives of both analytic and non-analytic functions of quaternion\nvariables, however, both the HR and other functional calculus in quaternion\nanalysis have encountered an essential technical obstacle, that is, the\ntraditional product rule is invalid due to the non- commutativity of the\nquaternion algebra. To address this issue, a generalized form of the HR\nderivative is proposed based on a general orthogonal system. The so introduced\ngeneralization, called the generalized HR (GHR) calculus, encompasses not just\nthe left- and right-hand versions of quaternion derivative, but also enables\nsolutions to some long standing problems, such as the novel product rule, the\nchain rule, the mean-valued theorem and Taylor's theorem. At the core of the\nproposed approach is the quaternion rotation, which can naturally be applied to\nother functional calculi in non-commutative settings.

This paper introduces an operator R that extracts\na set of 2^{N-1} element Boolean lattices from a 2^N element Boolean lattice.\nUsed recursively, a sequence of Boolean lattices with decreasing order is\ngenerated---a structure that is similar to an MRA. A second operator, which is\na special case of a \"difference operator\", is introduced that operates on\nconsecutive Boolean lattices L_2^n and L_2^{n-1} to produce a sequence of\northocomplemented lattices. These two sequences, together with the subset\nordering relation, form a primorial lattice P. A logic or probability\nconstructed on a Boolean lattice L_2^N likewise induces a primorial lattice P.\nSuch a logic or probability can then be rendered at N different \"resolutions\"\nby selecting any one of the N Boolean lattices in P and at N different\n\"frequencies\" by selecting any of the N different orthocomplemented lattices in\nP. Furthermore, P can be used for symbolic sequence analysis by projecting\nsequences of symbols onto the sublattices in P using one of three lattice\nprojectors introduced. P can be used for symbolic sequence processing by\njudicious rejection and selection of projected sequences. Examples of symbolic\nsequences include sequences of logic values, sequences of probabilistic events,\nand genomic sequences (as used in \"genomic signal processing\").\n",

These combine with phase factors to\ntake care of all the dependence of the solution on $x^{i}$ and $% dx^{i}$ for\neach $\\partial /\\partial x^{i}=0$ symmetry. The maximum number of idempotents\n(each for a one-parameter group) that can, therefore, go into a solution is the\ndimensionality $n$ of the space. This number is further limited by\nnon-commutativity of idempotents.\n  We consider the tensor product of Kaehler algebra with tangent Clifford\nalgebra, i.e. of valuedness. It has a commutative subalgebra of \"mirror\nelements\", i.e. where the valuedness is dual to the differential form (like in\n$dx\\mathbf{i}$, but not in $dx\\mathbf{j}$). It removes the aforementioned\nlimitation in the number of idempotent factors that can simultaneously go into\na solution.\n  In the Kaehler calculus, which is based on the Kaehler algebra, total angular\nmomentum is linear in its components, even it is not valued in tangent algebra.\nIn particular, it is not a vector operator.\n  We carry Kaehler's treatment over to the aforementioned commutative algebra.\nNon-commutativity thus ceases to be a limiting factor in the formation of\nproducts of idempotents representing each a one-parameter symmetry. The\ninterplay of factors that emerges in the expanded set of such products is\ninimical to operator theory. For practical reasons, we stop at products\ninvolving three one-parameter idempotents ---henceforth call ternary--- even\nthough the dimensionality of the all important spacetime manifold allows for\nfour of them.\n",

Appearing only in the theory, the contradiction does not exist in\nthe physical world.

In itself this\nnew zeta-sum (whose terms made up of elementary functions, but are unlike those\nthat arise from the analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series) proves to be\na computationally inefficient method for calculation of Z(t).

As a\nresult the rapid convergence towards the exact solutions of HPM indicates that,\nusing the HPM to solve the Newell-Whitehead-Segel non-linear differential\nequations, a reasonable less amount of computational work with acceptable\naccuracy may be sufficient.

Consider a continuous monotonic divergent function that is\ncontinually increasing. Apply the fundamental theorem of calculus. The integral\nis a difference of the function integrated at the end points. If one of these\npoint integrals is much-greater-than the other in magnitude delete it by\nnon-reversible arithmetic. We call this type of integration \"convergence sums\"\nbecause our primary application is a theory for the determination of\nconvergence and divergence of sums and integrals. The theory is far-reaching.\nIt reforms known convergence tests and arrangement theorems, and it connects\nintegration and series switching between the different forms. By separating the\nfinite and infinite domains, the mathematics is more naturally considered, and\nis a problem reduction. In this endeavour we rediscover and reform the\n\"boundary test\" which we believe to be the boundary between convergence and\ndivergence: the boundary is represented as an infinite class of generalized\np-series functions. All this is derived from extending du Bois-Reymond's theory\nwith gossamer numbers and function comparison algebra.\n",

Originally motivated by the\nrequirement to invent a new optimised integer factorisation method, this\nfoundational paper primarily focuses on the foundation, formalisation and\npresentation of a new theoretical framework (schema or blueprint) of a Collatz\nbased number system. The proposed framework is based on metamathematical\ntheories meticulously derived through iterative analyses and reverse\nengineering (i.e., by hand and mathematical computations) of many large subsets\nof integers. A collation of the fundamental results from these analytical\nattempts has led to the establishment of a completely deterministic model of a\ngeneralised Collatz based number system that is fundamentally and strangely\nassociated with nonchaotic patterns. The proposed Collatz based number schema\ncomprises of both visual and theoretical representations of many hidden\npatterns in Collatz sequences yet to be reported in literature. This novel\ntheoretical approach may be viewed as a new method to contemporary Collatz\nconjecture research which may be connected to the proofs of many other\nmathematical theorems in number theory and discrete mathematics.\n",

In the case of quaternion random\nvariables, some extensions have been proposed, leading to applications in\nquaternion signal processing (detection, filtering, estimation). Just like in\nthe complex case, circularity for a quaternion-valued random variable is\nrelated to the symmetries of its probability density function. As a\nconsequence, properness of quaternion random variables should be defined with\nrespect to the most general isometries in $4D$, i.e. rotations from $SO(4)$.\nBased on this idea, we propose a new definition of properness, namely the\n$(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)$-properness, for quaternion random variables using invariance\nproperty under the action of the rotation group $SO(4)$. This new definition\ngeneralizes previously introduced properness concepts for quaternion random\nvariables. A second order study is conducted and symmetry properties of the\ncovariance matrix of $(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)$-proper quaternion random variables are\npresented. Comparisons with previous definitions are given and simulations\nillustrate in a geometric manner the newly introduced concept.\n",

The existed compactness criteria are stated for three kinds of\nfuzzy sets spaces endowed with $L_p$ metric whose universe sets are the former\nthree kinds of common fuzzy sets respectively. Constructing completions of\nfuzzy sets spaces with respect to $L_p$ metric is a problem which is closely\ndependent on characterizing totally bounded sets. Based on preceding\ncharacterizations of totally boundedness and relatively compactness and some\ndiscussions on convexity and star-shapedness of fuzzy sets, we show that the\ncompletions of fuzzy sets spaces mentioned in this paper can be obtained by\nusing the $L_p$-extension.

Numerical\ncomputations with actual infinite and infinitesimal numbers can be executed on\nthe Infinity Computer being a new supercomputer patented in USA and EU.

Based on this fact and also on the pertinent\nproperly defined causality principle, it is concluded that an nDRAES can be\nregarded as a receptacle of Nature, i.e. as a receptacle of matter along with\nthe principle of special relativity and also along with all metamorphoses,\nwhich occur to matter in time in the irreversible direction from past through\npresent to future - metamorphoses that are called physical, chemical,\nbiological, etc. processes - if and only if n=3.\n",

Following the introduction of the shell primes, we will look\nat the results of a non-sieving application of the Euler zeta function to the\nprime shell function as well as to any integer-valued polynomial function in\ngeneral which has the ability to produce prime numbers when power $p$ is prime.\nOne familiar with the Euler zeta function, which established the remarkable\nrelationship between the prime and composite numbers, might naturally ponder\nthe results of the application of this special function in cases where there is\nno known way to sieve composite numbers out of the product term in this famous\nequation. Such would be case when an infinite series of numbers to be analyzed\nare calculated by a polynomial expression that yields successively increasing\npositive integer values and which has as its input domain the positive integers\nthemselves. In such cases there may not be an intuitive way to eliminate the\ncomposite terms from the product term in the Euler zeta function equation by\neither scaling a previous prime number calculation or by employing predictable\nvalues of the domain of the function which would render outputs of the\npolynomial prime. So the best one may be able to hope for in these cases is to\ncalculate some value to be added or subtracted from unity in the numerator\nabove the product term in the Euler Zeta function to make both sides of that\nequation equal with the expectation that that value could be used to predict\nthe number of prime numbers that exist as outputs of the polynomial function\nfor some limit less than or equal to x of the input domain.\n",

        "summary": "  No proof of the 4-color conjecture reveals why it is true; the goal has not\nbeen to go beyond proving the conjecture. The standard approach involves\nconstructing an unavoidable finite set of reducible configurations to\ndemonstrate that a minimal counterexample cannot exist. We study the 4-color\nproblem from a different perspective. Instead of planar triangulations, we\nconsider near-triangulations of the plane with a face of size 4; we call any\nsuch graph an a-graph. We state an a-graph coloring problem equivalent to the\n4-color problem and then derive a coloring condition that a minimal a-graph\ncounterexample must satisfy, expressing it in terms of equivalence classes\nunder Kempe exchanges. Through a systematic search, we discover a family of\na-graphs that satisfy the coloring condition, the fundamental member of which\nhas order 12 and includes the Birkhoff diamond as a subgraph. Higher-order\nmembers include a string of Birkhoff diamonds. However, no member has an\napplicable parent triangulation that is internally 6-connected, a requirement\nfor a minimal counterexample. Our research suggests strongly that the coloring\nand connectivity conditions for a minimal counterexample are incompatible;\ninfinitely many a-graphs meet one condition or the other, but we find none that\nmeets both.\n",

Firstly, on the class of upper semi-continuous\nfuzzy sets with bounded $\\alpha$-cuts, we find that an endograph metric\nconvergent sequence is exactly a $\\Gamma$-convergent sequence satisfying the\ncondition that the union of $\\alpha$-cuts of all its elements is a bounded set\nin $\\mathbb{R}^m$ for each $\\alpha > 0$. Secondly, based on investigations of\nlevel characterizations of fuzzy sets themselves, we present level\ncharacterizations (level decomposition properties) of the endograph metric and\nthe $\\Gamma$-convergence. It is worth mentioning that, using the condition and\nthe level characterizations given above, we discover the fact: the endograph\nmetric and the $\\Gamma$-convergence are compatible on a large class of general\nfuzzy sets which do not have any assumptions of normality, convexity or\nstar-shapedness. Its subsets include common particular fuzzy sets such as fuzzy\nnumbers (compact and noncompact), fuzzy star-shaped numbers (compact and\nnoncompact), and general fuzzy star-shaped numbers (compact and noncompact).\nThirdly, on the basis of the conclusions presented above, we study various\nsubspaces of the space of upper semi-continuous fuzzy sets with bounded\n$\\alpha$-cuts equipped with the endograph metric. We present characterizations\nof total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness in these fuzzy set\nspaces and clarify relationships among these fuzzy set spaces.

It is known that two integral\nlines, expressing the completed zeta function, rotated from the real axis in\nthe opposite directions, can be shifted without affecting the completed zeta\nfunction owing to the residue theorem. The completed zeta function is regular\nin the region of the complex plane under consideration.

One can also study the\nreverse problem of expressing the vertices of a given graph as distinct sets in\nsuch a way that adjacency coincides with intersection of the corresponding\nsets. The sets are usually required to conform to some template, depending on\nthe problem, to be either a finite set, or some geometric set like intervals,\ncircles, discs, cubes etc. The problem of representing a graph as an\nintersection graph of sets was first introduced by Erdos and they looked at\nminimising the underlying universal set necessary to represent any given graph.\nIn that paper it was shown that the problem is NP complete. In this paper we\nstudy a natural variant of this problem which is to consider graphs where\nvertices represent distinct sets and adjacency coincides with disjointness.\nAlthough this is really the same problem on the complement graph, for specific\nfamilies of graphs this is a more natural way of viewing it. When taken across\nthe spectrum of all graphs the two problems are evidently identical. Our\nmotivation to look at disjointness instead of intersection is that several well\nknown graphs like the Petersen graph and Knesser graphs are expressed in the\nlatter method, and the complements of these families are not well studied. The\nparameters we take into account are the maximum size of an individual vertex\nlabel, minimum universe size possible (disregarding individual label sizes) and\nversions of these two where it is required that each vertex gets labels of the\nsame size.\n",

Square roots of\nprobabilities appear in expressions of the Fisher-Rao Metric and the\nHellinger-Bhattacharyya distance. They also come into play in Quantum Mechanics\nvia the Born rule where probabilities are found by taking the squared modulus\nof the quantum amplitude. Why should this be the case and why do these square\nroots not arise in the various formulations of probability theory?\n  In this short, inconclusive exploration, I consider quantifying a logical\nstatement with a vector defined by a set of components each quantifying one of\nthe atomic statements defining the hypothesis space. I show that conditional\nprobabilities (bi-valuations), such as $P(x|y)$, can be written as the dot\nproduct of the two vectors quantifying the logical statements $x$ and $y$ each\nnormalized with respect to the vector quantifying the conditional $y$. The\ncomponents of the vectors are proportional to the square root of the\nprobability. As a result, this formulation is shown to be consistent with a\nconcept of orthogonality applied to the set of mutually exclusive atomic\nstatements such that the sum rule is represented as the sum of the squares of\nthe square roots of probability.\n",

The inequality is considered for\n${n>e^{e^{3/2}}}$, i.e., ${n\\geq 89}$, but since the inequalities for ${n\\geq\n195340>e^{e^{5/2}}}$, are also required, these inequalities are explicitly\nproven as well.

The completeness of the problem in these finite number\nof recurrent forms (here, six recurrent forms), such that the elements of the\nCollatz path sequence switches in-between till one of them reaches a number of\nthe form 2m is shown. Further, by using heuristic analysis on the frequency\ndistribution of these recurrence forms, the manifestation of statistical bias\nand constructive analytical formulation and convergence for some of these\nrecurrent forms is exhibited. Unlike many other approaches described in\nliterature, the present contribution illustrates the existence of a recurrence\nquantification of the Collatz conjecture. Also if the presented analysis can be\nmade rigorous to solve the set of linear congruence equations for the Collatz\nFSM model, the exact true nature of Collatz problem can be inferred.\n",

In the first chapter authors suggest an estimator using two auxiliary\nvariables in stratified random sampling for estimating population mean. In\nsecond chapter they proposed a family of estimators for estimating population\nmeans using known value of some population parameters. In Chapter third an\nalmost unbiased estimator using known value of some population parameter(s)\nwith known population proportion of an auxiliary variable has been used. In\nChapter four the authors investigates a fuzzy economic order quantity model for\ntwo storage facility. The demand, holding cost, ordering cost, storage capacity\nof the own - warehouse are taken as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In Chapter five\na two-warehouse inventory model deals with deteriorating items, with stock\ndependent demand rate and model affected by inflation under the pattern of time\nvalue of money over a finite planning horizon. Shortages are allowed and\npartially backordered depending on the waiting time for the next replenishment.\nThe purpose of this model is to minimize the total inventory cost by using the\ngenetic algorithm. This book will be helpful for the researchers and students\nwho are working in the field of sampling techniques and inventory control.\n",

The paper\nemploys a novel method of summing the series by casting it as an infinite\nnumber of sums over sub-series that exhibit a certain symmetry and rapid\nconvergence. In this procedure, which heavily invokes the prime factorization\ntheorem, each sub-series has the property that it oscillates in a predictable\nfashion, rendering the analytic properties of the Dirichlet series\ndeterminable. With this method, the paper demonstrates that, for every integer\nwith an even number of primes in its factorization, there is another integer\nthat has an odd number of primes (multiplicity counted) in its factorization.\nFurthermore, by showing that a sufficient condition derived by Littlewood\n(1912) is satisfied, the paper demonstrates that the function F(s) is analytic\nover the two half-planes Re(s) > 1/2 and Re(s)<1/2. This establishes that the\nnontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function can only occur on the critical\nline Re(s)=1/2.\n",

        "summary": "  Linear systems often involve, as a basic building block, solutions of\nequations of the form \\begin{align*} A_Sx_S&+A_Px_P =0\\\\ A'_Sx_S & =0,\n\\end{align*} where our primary interest might be in the vector variable $x_P.$\nUsually, neither $x_S$ nor $x_P$ can be written as a function of the other but\nthey are linked through the linear relationship, that of $(x_S,x_P) $ belonging\nto $\\mathcal{V}_{SP},$ the solution space of the first of the two equations. If\n$\\mathcal{V}_{S}$ is the solution space of the second equation, we may regard\nthe final space of solutions $\\mathcal{V}_{P}$ as derived from the other two\nspaces by an operation, say, `$\\mathcal{V}_{P}=\\mathcal{V}_{SP}\\leftrightarrow\n\\mathcal{V}_{S}.$' This operation, together with linear relationships, can be\nused to build a version of linear algebra which we call `implicit linear\nalgebra'. There are two basic results - an `implicit inversion theorem' which\ndescribes when $\\mathcal{V}_{S}$ can be obtained from $\\mathcal{V}_{P}$ and\n$\\mathcal{V}_{SP},$ and an `implicit duality theorem' which says\n$\\mathcal{V}_{P}^{\\bot}=\\mathcal{V}_{SP}^{\\bot}\\leftrightarrow\n\\mathcal{V}_{S}^{\\bot}.$ These notions originally arose in the building of\ncircuit simulators. They have been reinterpreted for the present purpose. Using\nthem, we develop an algorithmic version of linear multivariable control theory,\navoiding the computationally expensive idea of state equations. We replace them\nby `emulators', which are easy to build, but can achieve most of whatever can\nbe done with state equations. We define the notions of generalized autonomous\nsystems and generalized operators, and develop a primitive spectral theory for\nthe latter. Using these ideas, we develop the usual controllability -\nobservability duality, state and output feedback, pole placement etc.\n",

For probability measures induced by real-valued\nrandom variables, we deduce an \"equality\" such that one side of the \"equality\"\nis a probability, but the other side is not. For probability measures induced\nby extended random variables, we deduce an \"equality\" such that its two sides\nare unequal probabilities. The deduced expressions are erroneous only when it\ncan be proved that measure-theoretic probability is a theory free from\ncontradiction. However, such a proof does not exist. The inconsistency appears\nonly in the theory rather than in the physical world, and will not affect\npractical applications as long as ideal events in the theory (which will not\noccur physically) are not mistaken for observable events in the real world.\nNevertheless, unlike known paradoxes in mathematics, the inconsistency cannot\nbe explained away and hence must be resolved. The assumption of infinite\nadditivity in the theory is relevant to the inconsistency, and may cause\nconfusion of ideal events and real events. As illustrated by an example in this\narticle, since abstract properties of mathematical entities in theoretical\nthinking are not necessarily properties of physical quantities observed in the\nreal world, mistaking the former for the latter may lead to misinterpreting\nrandom phenomena observed in experiments with microscopic systems. Actually the\ninconsistency is due to the notion of \"numbers\" adopted in conventional\nmathematics. A possible way to resolve the inconsistency is to treat \"numbers\"\nfrom the viewpoint of constructive mathematics.\n",

Such a notion plays very important\nroles in differential geometry as well as in physics, especially in general\nrelativity.

Here\n$\\theta(x):=\\theta_3(0,ix)$ and $\\theta_3(0,z)$ is a Jacobi theta function, a\nmodular form of weight $\\frac{1}{2}$.

For no (v,k,\\lambda) satisfying these requirements has it been shown\nthat a symmetric (v,k,\\lambda) design does not exist. Projective planes of\norder n exist for all prime powers n (aside from PG(2,n) a host of other\nconstructions are known ) but for no other n is a construction known. The first\nopen values are n=10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 26$ and 28. It was proved by a\ncomputer search that there does not exist any projective plane of order 10 by\nLam, C.W.H., Thiel, L. and Swiercz, S. Whether there exists any projective\nplane of order 12 is still open.The author introduces the bordered matrix of a\n(v,k,\\lambda) symmetric design and gives some new necessary conditions for the\nexistence of the symmetric (v,k,\\lambda) design. As their application it is\neasy to determine that there does not exist finite projective plane of order n\nif n is one of the first open values 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 26 and 28, for\nwhich the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla Theorem can not be used. For large n the new\nmethod is also valid. Also some symmetric designs are excluded by the new\nmethod.\n",

In the present paper, a rather elementary approach more\nsuited to write codes of computer programming is adapted. If we introduce\ncurvilinear coordinates, we would be able to treat in more natural way to\nhandle fixed discontinuity, moving discontinuity and curved boundary. We could\ngenerate fine mesh in the neighborhood of fixed and moving discontinuities.\nFurthermore, if we introduce curvilinear coordinates, we can transform a\nnon-square region into square one and can use a regular mesh.

It is defined\nto be the minimum number of vertices whose removal results in a subgraph that\nadmits a $J$-colouring. The new notions of chromatic degree of a vertex\n$d_\\chi(v)$, the maximum and minimum chromatic degrees of $G$ denoted,\n$\\Delta_\\chi(G)$ and $\\delta_\\chi(G)$ respectively, are also introduced. The\nchromatic diameter of $G$ denoted, $d(G,\\chi)$ is introduced as well. The study\nof $ren(G)$ appears to be very complex for graphs in general so for now, only\nintroductory results will be presented. Finally, the concept of a chromatic\ndegree sequence is proposed as a new research direction.\n",

Then, rearrange the digits of the original number in\nascending and descending order, take these two numbers, and find the difference\nbetween the two. Finally, repeat this routine using the difference as the new\nfour-digit number. In 1949, D. R. Kaprekar became the first to discover that\nthis process, known as the Kaprekar Routine, would always yield 6174 within 7\niterations. Since this number remains unchanged after an application of the\nKaprekar Routine, it became known as Kaprekar's Constant. Previous works have\nshown that the only base 10 Kaprekar's Constants are 495 and 6174, the 3-digit\nand 4-digit case. However, little attention has been given to other bases or\ndetermining which digit cases and which bases have a Kaprekar's Constant. This\npaper analyzes the behavior of the Kaprekar Routine in the 3-digit case,\nderiving an expression for all 3-digit Kaprekar Constants. In addition, the\nauthor developed a series of C++ programs to analyze the paths integers\nfollowed to their respective Kaprekar's Constant. Surprisingly, it was\ndetermined from this program that the most commonly required number of\niterations required to reach Kaprekar's Constant for 3-digit integers was\nconsistently 3, regardless of base.

The analogy between the measure of a set and the probability of an\nevent has become clear for a long time. This analogy also allows further\nevolution: the measure of a set is completely analogous to the believability of\nan event. In order to postulate the theory of experience and chance on the\nbasis of this analogy, you just need to add to the Kolmogorov probability\ntheory its dual reflection - the believability theory, so that the theory of\nexperience and chance could be postulated as the certainty\n(believability-probability) theory on the Cartesian product of the probability\nand believability spaces, and the central concept of the theory is the new\nnotion of co~event as a measurable binary relation on the Cartesian product of\nsets of elementary incomes and elementary outcomes. Attempts to build the\nfoundations of the theory of experience and chance from this general point of\nview are unknown to me, and the whole range of ideas presented here has not yet\nacquired popularity even in a narrow circle of specialists; in addition, there\nwas still no complete system of the postulates of the theory of experience and\nchance free from unnecessary complications. The main result of this work is the\naxiom of co~event, intended for the sake of constructing a theory formed by\ndual theories of believabilities and probabilities, each of which itself is\npostulated by its own Kolmogorov system of axioms. Here a preference is given\nto a system of postulates that is able to describe in a simple manner the\nresults of what I call an experienced-random experiment.\n",

It both offers a possibility to create\nnew numerical methods using infinities and infinitesimals in floating-point\ncomputations and allows one to study certain mathematical objects dealing with\ninfinity more accurately than it is done traditionally.

We\nmay thus construct a differential sequence with successive operators\n${\\cal{D}},{\\cal{D}}_1,{\\cal{D}}_2, ...$, where each operator is generating the\nCC of the previous one. Introducing the formal adjoint $ad( )$, we have\n${\\cal{D}}_i\\circ {\\cal{D}}_{i-1}=0 \\Rightarrow ad({\\cal{D}}_{i-1}) \\circ\nad({\\cal{D}}_i)=0$ but $ad({\\cal{D}}_{i-1})$ may not generate all the CC of\n$ad({\\cal{D}}_i)$. When $D=K[d_1,...,d_n]=K[d]$ is the (non-commutative) ring\nof differential operators with coefficients in a differential field $K$, it\ngives rise by residue to a differential module $M$ over $D$. The homological\nextension modules $ext^i(M)=ext^i_D(M,D)$ with $ext^0(M)=hom_D(M,D)$ only\ndepend on $M$ and are measuring the above gaps, independently of the previous\ndifferential sequence.The purpose of this rather technical paper is to compute\nthem for certain Lie operators involved in the formal theory of Lie\npseudogroups in arbitrary dimension $n$.

        "summary": "  In this article I present results from a statistical study of prime numbers\nthat shows a behaviour that is not compatible with the thesis that they are\ndistributed randomly. The analysis is based on studying two arithmetical\nprogressions defined by the following polynomials: ($1+6n$, $5+6n$, $n\\in{N}$)\nwhose respective numerical sequences have the characteristic of containing all\nthe prime numbers except $3$ and $2$. If prime numbers were distributed\nrandomly, we would expect the two polynomials to generate the same number of\nprimes. Instead, as the reported findings show, we note that the polynomial\n$5+6n$ tends to generate many more primes, and that this divergence grows\nprogressively as more prime numbers are considered. A possible explanation for\nthis phenomenon can be found by calculating the number of products that\ngenerate composite numbers which are expressible by the two polynomials. This\nanalysis reveals that the number of products that generate composite numbers\nexpressible by the polynomial $1+6n$ is $(n+1)^{ 2}$, while the number of\nproducts that generate composites expressible by the polynomial $5+6n$ is\n$(n+1)n$, con $n\\in{N}$. As a composite number is a non-prime number, this\ndifference incited me to analyse the distribution of prime numbers generated by\nthe two polynomials. The results, based on studying the first (approx.) 500\nmillion prime numbers, confirm the fact that the number of primes that can be\nwritten using the polynomial $1+6n$ is lower than the number of primes that can\nwritten using the polynomial $5+6n$, and that this divergence grows\nprogressively with the number of primes considered.\n",

This paper presents the axioms one has to\naccept to get rid of these two features. For that matter, some twenty axioms\nare formulated in a nonstandard first-order language with countable many\nconstants: to this collection of axioms is associated a universe of discourse\nconsisting of a class of objects, each of which is a set, and a class of\narrows, each of which is a function. The axioms of ZF are derived from this\nfinite axiom scheme, and it is shown that it does not have a countable\nmodel--if it has a model at all, that is. Furthermore, the axioms of category\ntheory are proven to hold: the present universe may therefore serve as an\nontological basis for category theory. However, it has not been investigated\nwhether any of the soundness and completeness properties hold for the present\ntheory: the inevitable conclusion is therefore that only further research can\nestablish whether the present results indeed constitute an advancement in the\nfoundations of mathematics.\n",

In past few years, a number of generalizations\nof graph theoretical concepts have developed to model the impreciseness and\nuncertainties in graphical network problems. A Pythagorean fuzzy set is a\npowerful tool for describing the vague concepts more precisely. The Pythagorean\nfuzzy set-based models provide more flexibility in handling the human judgment\ninformation as compared to other fuzzy models. The objective of this paper is\nto apply the concept of Pythagorean fuzzy sets to graph theory. This work\nintroduces the notion of Pythagorean fuzzy graphs (PFGs) and describes a number\nof methods for their construction. We then define some basic operations on PFGs\nand prove some of their important properties. The work also discusses the\nnotion of isomorphism between Pythagorean fuzzy graphs with a numerical\nexample. Further, we introduce the concept of the strong Pythagorean fuzzy\ngraph and the complete Pythagorean fuzzy graph. In addition, the paper also\nproves some results on self-complementary, self-weak complementary with\nPythagorean fuzzy strong graphs and Pythagorean fuzzy complete graphs.\n",

Such situation may be caused by that people used to study Zeta\nfunction only regarding it as a complex function. Generally, complex functions\nare far more complex than real functions, and are hard to graph. So, people\ncannot grasp the nature of them easily. Therefore, it may be a promising way to\ntry to correspond Zeta function to real function so that we can return to the\nreal domain to study RH.\n  In fact, by the view of Laplace transform, the whole picture of Zeta function\nis very clear and simple, and the problem can be greatly simplified. And by\nLaplace transform, most integral and convolution operations can be converted\ninto algebraic operations, which greatly simplifies calculating and analysis.\nThis is a really and full new way to research Zeta function, prime numbers\ndistribution, RH and so on. In fact, many new, important and interesting\nresults can be reached by this new way, far more that shown in this paper.\n  In September 2018, I had discussed with Sir Michael F Atiyah about RH and our\nproofs, etc. Sir Atiyah was so nice and patient, and he gave my approach rather\npositive evaluation.

Here, we suggest that a resolution to this long-standing\nconundrum is attainable by defining the primes prior to the natural numbers -\nas opposed to the standard number theoretical definition of primes where these\nnumbers derive from the natural numbers. The result is a first-principles\nperspective on the primes that exposes and explains the 'origins' of their\ndistribution and their mathematical properties and provides an intuitive as\nwell as pedagogical approach to the primes with the potential to impact our\nthinking about these age-old mathematical objects. A few immediate outcomes of\nthis perspective are another proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, a\nprobabilistic model of primes sharing as well as explaining their subrandom\ncorrelation structure, and an equivalent formulation of the Riemann hypothesis.\n",

To prove this conjecture, I have identified a subset of\nthe even numbers that have relatively few prime pairs compared to the other\neven numbers. This subset is the set of all n such that n=2p where p is prime.\nAn equation was derived that determines the number of prime pairs for n=2p.

As an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, an English\nmathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy proposed in $1940$ that the real part of all\ncomplex zeros of the Ramanujan zeta function is $6$. This is the well-known\nRiemann-Hardy hypothesis for the Ramanujan zeta function. This article is\ndevoted to the proof of this hypothesis derived from the Ramanujan-Rankin\nfunction. Owing to the integral representation of the Ramanujan-De Bruijn\nfunction, we establish its series. We also reduce its product using the\nHadamard's factorization theorem. By a class with its series and product\nrepresentations, we conclude that the real part of all zeros for Ramanujan-De\nBruijn function is zero. we also obtain its products of Conrey and Ghosh and\nHadamard-type for the Ramanujan-Rankin function. Based on the obtained result,\nwe prove that the Riemann-Hardy hypothesis is true.\n",

We find that the\nsum-of-the-digits of prime numbers does not have an equal probability of being\nodd or even. The authors know of no reason why prime numbers should bias\nthemselves towards a particular parity in their sums of digits, but our\nempirical tests show a very strong bias; strong enough that we are able to\ndevise a test to reliably differentiate between collections of prime numbers\nversus random numbers by looking only at their sums of digits. We are also able\nto create similar tests for products of primes. We are even able to test\n\"tainted\" sets with mixtures of primes and random numbers: as the percentage of\n(randomly chosen) prime numbers in a set of random numbers is varied, we get a\nreliable, linear change in our parity measure. For example, when we add up the\ndigits of prime numbers in base 10, their sum is significantly more likely to\nbe odd than even. This effect persists across base changes, although which\nparity is more common might change. Note that the last digit being odd in base\n10 simply reverses the parity. We have tested this for the first fifty million\nprimes -- not primes up to 50,000,000, but the first 50,000,000 prime numbers\n-- and have found that this effect persists, and does so in a predictable\nmanner. The effect is quite significant; for 50,000,000 primes in base 10, the\nnumber of primes which have an odd sum-of-digits is about an order of magnitude\nfarther away from the mean than expected. We have run multiple tests to try and\nunderstand the source of this bias, including investigating primes modulo\nrandom numbers and adjusting for Chebyshev's bias. None of these tests yielded\nany satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon.\n",

Although\nthere have been a lot of activities in nonlinear, fractional or not, dynamical\nsystems, the above question appears yet to be addressed systematically in the\ncurrent literature. The present work may be considered to be a step forward in\nthis direction. Based on a novel concept of asymptotic duality structure, we\npresent here an extended analytical framework that would provide a scenario for\nrealizing the above stated continuous deformation of integral order dynamics to\na local fractional order dynamics on a fractal and fractional space. The\nrelated concepts of self dual and strictly dual asymptotics are introduced and\nthere relevance in connection with smooth and nonsmooth deformation of the real\nline are pointed out. The relationship of the duality structure and\nrenormalization group is examined. The ordinary derivation operator is shown to\nbe invariant under this duality enabled renormalization group transformation,\nleading thereby to a {\\em natural} realization of local fractional type\nderivative in a fractal space. As an application we discuss linear wave\nequation in one and two dimensions and show how the underlying integral order\nwave equation could be deformed and renormalized suitably to yield meaningful\nresults for vibration of a fractal string or wave propagation in a region with\nfractal boundary.\n",

Intersection cographs, especially, promise many\napplications; described here are some to aesthetics. Point-line cographs turn\nout equivalent to linear spaces. Finally solved here is an interesting\ngroup-theoretic problem arising from group cographs (points in a group; C(P,Q)\n= {PQ,QP}).\n",

Macaulay developed specific localization techniques for dealing\nwith \"unmixed polynomial ideals\" in commutative algebra, transforming them into\nwhat he called \"inverse systems\" of partial differential equations. In 1970,\nD.C. Spencer and coworkers studied the formal theory of such systems, using\nmethods of homological algebra that were giving rise to \"differential\nhomological algebra\", replacing unmixed polynomial ideals by \"pure differential\nmodules\". The use of \"extension modules\" and \"differential double duality\" is\nessential for such a purpose. In particular, 0-pure differential modules are\ntorsion-free and admit an \"absolute parametrization\" by means of arbitrary\npotential like functions. In 2012, we have been able to extend this result to\narbitrary pure modules, introducing a \"relative parametrization\" where the\npotentials should satisfy compatible \"differential constraints\". We recently\ndiscovered that General Relativity is just a way to parametrize the Cauchy\nstress equations by means of the formal adjoint of the Ricci operator in order\nto obtain a \"minimum parametrization\" by adding sufficiently many compatible\ndifferential constraints, exactly like the Lorenz condition in\nelectromagnetism. These unusual purely mathematical results are illustrated by\nmany explicit examples and even strengthen the comments we recently provided on\nthe mathematical foundations of General Relativity and Gauge Theory.\n",

        "summary": "  A double Roman dominating function of a graph $G$ is a function\n$f:V(G)\\rightarrow \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ having the property that for each vertex $v$\nwith $f(v)=0$, there exists $u\\in N(v)$ with $f(u)=3$, or there are $u,w\\in\nN(v)$ with $f(u)=f(w)=2$, and if $f(v)=1$, then $v$ is adjacent to a vertex\nassigned at least $2$ under $f$. The double Roman domination number\n$\\gamma_{dR}(G)$ is the minimum weight $f(V(G))=\\sum_{v\\in V(G)}f(v)$ among all\ndouble Roman dominating functions of $G$. An outer independent double Roman\ndominating function is a double Roman dominating function $f$ for which the set\nof vertices assigned $0$ under $f$ is independent. The outer independent double\nRoman domination number $\\gamma_{oidR}(G)$ is the minimum weight taken over all\nouter independent double Roman dominating functions of $G$.\n  In this work, we present some contributions to the study of outer independent\ndouble Roman domination in graphs. Characterizations of the families of all\nconnected graphs with small outer independent double Roman domination numbers,\nand tight lower and upper bounds on this parameter are given. We moreover bound\nthis parameter for a tree $T$ from below by two times the vertex cover number\nof $T$ plus one. We also prove that the decision problem associated with\n$\\gamma_{oidR}(G)$ is NP-complete even when restricted to planar graphs with\nmaximum degree at most four. Finally, we give an exact formula for this\nparameter concerning the corona graphs.\n",

        "summary": "  The embracing of actual infinity in mathematics leads naturally to the\nquestion of comparing the sizes of infinite collections. The basic dilemma is\nthat the Cantor Principle (CP), according to which two sets have the same size\nif there is a one-to-one correspondence between their elements, and the\nPart-Whole Principle (PW), according to which the whole is greater than its\npart, are inconsistent for infinite collections. Contemporary axiomatic\nset-theoretic systems, for instance, ZFC, are based on CP. PW is not valid for\ninfinite sets. In the last two decades, the topic of sizes of infinite sets has\nresurfaced again in a number of papers. A question of whether it is possible to\ncompare the sizes to comply with PW has been risen and researched. Bernard\nBolzano in his 1848 Paradoxes of the Infinite dealt with principles of\nintroducing infinity into mathematics. He created a theory of infinite\nquantities that respects PW and which is based on sums of infinite series. We\nextend Bolzano's theory and create a constructive method for determining the\nset size of countable sets so that the cardinality of finite sets is preserved\nand PW is valid. Our concept is close to the numerosity theory from the\nbeginning of this century but it is simpler and more intuitive. In the results,\nwe partly agree with the theory of numerosities. The sizes of countable sets\nare uniquely determined, but they are not linearly ordered.\n",

Rather than studying potential fixed points of such\noperators, we examine their effect on the singularities of functions. To that\nend, we introduce the notion of a \"dreamcatcher\", an object which encodes the\nlocation and \"virtual residue\" of the singularities of an analytic function of\na specified growth rate along the boundary of the function's region of\nconvergence. Dreamcatchers can be given rigorous footing as elements of the\nHilbert space L2(Q/Z) of complex-valued functions on Q/Z which are\nsquare-integrable with respect to the counting measure on Q/Z. The\naforementioned linear operators (called here \"permutation operators\") are shown\nto \"conserve\" the singularities of their fixed points, in the sense that the\ndreamcatcher of a fixed point is itself the fixed point of the operator induced\non L2(Q/Z) (the \"dreamcatcher operator\") by the permutation operator. Using\nPontryagin duality and p-adic analysis, the fixed points of the operators\nacting on dreamcatchers for simple-pole-like singularities are completely\ndetermined for a large class of Hydra maps in the case where the fixed points\nare finitely supported on Q/Z. This enables qualitative conclusions to be made\nabout those Hydra maps' orbit classes in the non-negative integers.\n",

By replacing the\ntime derivatives in the above standard equations with pseudo-differential\noperators interpreted as derivatives of non integer order (nowadays misnamed as\nof fractional order) we are lead to generalized processes of diffusion that may\nbe interpreted as slow diffusion and interpolating between diffusion and wave\npropagation. In mathematical physics we may refer these interpolating processes\nto as fractional diffusion-wave phenomena. In this work we analyze and simulate\nboth the situations in which the input function is a Dirac delta generalized\nfunction and a box function, restricting ourselves to the Cauchy problem. In\nthe firsrst case we get the fundamental solutions (or Green functions) of the\nproblem whereas in the latter case the solutions are obtained by a space\nconvolution of the Green function with the input function. In order to clarify\nthe matter for the non-specialist readers, we briefly recall the basic and\nessential notions of the fractional calculus (the mathematical theory that\nregards the integration and differentiation of noninteger order) with a look at\nthe history of this discipline.\n",

NS is also more flexible and effective\nbecause it handles, besides independent components, also partially independent\nand partially dependent components, while IFS cannot deal with these.

Under the assumption that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are\nthree nonsingular matrices of the same size, the products $AB$ and $ABC$ are\nnonsingular as well, and the inverses of $AB$ and $ABC$ admit the reverse order\nlaws $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}$ and $(ABC)^{-1} = C^{-1}B^{-1}A^{-1}$,\nrespectively. If some or all of $A$, $B$, and $C$ are singular, two extensions\nof the above reverse order laws to generalized inverses can be written as\n$(AB)^{(i,\\ldots,j)} = B^{(i_2,\\ldots,j_2)} A^{(i_1,\\ldots,j_1)}$ and\n$(ABC)^{(i,\\ldots,j)} = C^{(i_3,\\ldots,j_3)}\nB^{(i_2,\\ldots,j_2)}A^{(i_1,\\ldots,j_1)}$, or other mixed reverse order laws.\nThese equalities do not necessarily hold for different choices of generalized\ninverses of the matrices.

A $k$-total difference labeling of a graph $G$ is a\nfunction $f$ from the set of edges and vertices of $G$ to the set\n$\\{1,2,\\ldots,k\\}$, that is a $k$-total labeling of $G$ and for which\n$f(\\{u,v\\})=|f(u)-f(v)|$ for any two adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ with\nincident edge $\\{u,v\\}$. The least positive integer $k$ for which $G$ has a\n$k$-total difference labeling is its total difference chromatic number,\n$\\chi_{td}(G)$. We determine the total difference chromatic number of paths,\ncycles, stars, wheels, gears and helms.

This new algebraic structure is\nbased on the notion of mobility algebra which has recently been introduced as a\nmodel for the unit interval of real numbers. Mobility algebras consist on a set\n$A$ together with three constants and a ternary operation. In the case of the\nclosed unit interval $A=[0,1]$, the three constants are 0, 1 and 1/2 while the\nternary operation is $p(x,y,z)=x-yx+yz$. A mobility space is a set $X$ together\nwith a map $q\\colon{X\\times A\\times X\\to X}$ with the meaning that $q(x,t,y)$\nindicates the position of a particle moving from point $x$ to point $y$ at the\ninstant $t\\in A$, along a geodesic path within the space $X$. A mobility space\nis thus defined with respect to a mobility algebra, in the same way as a module\nis defined over a ring. We introduce the axioms for mobility spaces,\ninvestigate the main properties and give examples. We also establish the\nconnection between the algebraic context and the one of spaces with geodesic\npaths. The connection with affine spaces is briefly mentioned.\n",

Therefore QED is\nmathematically invalid. Zeta function regularization equates two definitions of\nthe Zeta function at domain values where they contradict (where the Dirichlet\nseries definition is divergent and Riemann's definition is convergent). Doing\nso either creates a paradox (if Riemann's definition is true), or is logically\ninvalid (if Riemann's definition is false). We show that Riemann's definition\nis false, because the derivation of Riemann's definition includes a\ncontradiction: the use of both the Hankel contour and Cauchy's integral\ntheorem.

In this article we present a point of view that highlights the\nimportance of finding the upper bounds for prime gaps, in order to solve the\ntwin primes conjecture and the Goldbach conjecture. For this purpose, we\npresent a procedure for the determination of the upper bounds for prime gaps\ndifferent from the most famous and known approaches. The proposed method\nanalyzes the distribution of prime numbers using the set of relative numbers.\nUsing negative numbers too, it becomes intuitive to understand that that the\narrangement of 2P+1 consecutive numbers that goes -P to P, is the only\narrangement that minimizes the distance between two powers having the same\nabsolute value of the base D, with |D|<=P. This arrangement is considered\nimportant because by increasing the number of powers of the prime numbers\nwithin a range of consecutive numbers, it is presumed to decrease the overlap\nbetween the prime numbers considered. Consequently, by reducing these overlaps,\nwe suppose to obtain an arrangement, in which the prime numbers less than and\nequal to P and their multiples occupy the greatest possible number of positions\nwithin a range of 2P+1 consecutive numbers. If this result could be\ndemonstrated, would imply not only the resolution of the Legendre conjecture,\nbut also a step forward in the resolution of the twin primes conjecture and the\nGoldbach conjecture.\n",

But $div\n\\textbf{u}(x,t)=\\sum_1^3 \\frac{du_i(x,t)}{dx_i}=0.$ Using these equations and\nthe following properties of the fundamental function: $Z(x,t;\\xi,\\tau)$:\n$\\frac{dZ(x,t;\\xi,\\tau)}{d x_i}=-\\frac{d Z(x,t; \\xi,\\tau)}{d \\xi_i},$ for the\ndefinition of the unknown pressure p(x,t) we shall receive the integral\nequation. From this integral equation we define the explicit expression of the\npressure: $p(x,t)=-\\frac{d}{dt}\\triangle^{-1}\\ast\\int_0^t\\int_{\\Omega}\\sum_1^3\n\\frac{dG(x,t;\\xi,\\tau)}{dx_i}w_i(\\xi,\\tau)d\\xi\nd\\tau+\\rho\\cdot\\int_0^t\\int_{\\Omega}\\sum_1^3\\frac{dG(x,t;\\xi,\\tau)}{dx_i}w_i(\\xi,\\tau)d\\xi\nd\\tau.$ By this formula the following estimate:\n$\\int_0^t\\sum_1^3\\Big\\|\\frac{\\partial p(x,\\tau)}{\\partial\nx_i}\\Big\\|_{L_2(\\Omega)}^2 d\n\\tau<c\\cdot\\int_0^t\\sum_1^3\\|w_i(x,\\tau)\\|_{L_2(\\Omega)}^2 d\\tau$ holds.\n",

The values at x=0\nof arbitrary composition sequences of the maps x/2 and (px+1)/2 can be\nparameterized over the 2-adic integers (Z2) leading to a continuous function\nfrom Z2 to Zp which the author calls the \"characteristic function\" (or \"numen\")\nof H_p. Lipschitz-type estimates are given for the characteristic function when\np-1 is a power of 2 and 2 is a primitive root mod p, and it is shown that the\nset of periodic points of H_p is equal to the set of (rational) integer values\nattained by the characteristic function over Z2. Additionally, although the\npre-image of R under the characteristic function has zero Haar measure in the\nZ2, by pre-composing the characteristic function with an appropriately selected\nself-embedding of Z2, one can perform Fourier analysis of the aforementioned\ncomposite. Using this approach, explicit upper bounds are computed for the\nabsolute value of a periodic point of H_p whose parity vector contains at least\nceil(ln(p)/ln2)-1 zeroes between any two consecutive ones\n",

This can be useful, for instance, to locally study a space that\ncannot be globally endowed with an algebraic structure using tools from\nalgebra. The definition of these spaces will be made more precise via one of\nour main result, which involves the 'structure map'. This will also lead us to\na rigorous and unambiguous definition of algebraic structure. After showing\nsome examples which naturally arise in this context, we study various\nproperties and develop some theory for these new spaces; in particular, we\nconsider partitions (with respect to some measure $\\mu$). We then prove one of\nthe most important Theorem of this paper (Theorem 4.1), which states that every\nstructured space, under some assumptions, induces a lattice, and conversely\nevery lattice induces a structured space satisfing such hypothesis. We conclude\nwith some relations with connected spaces.\n",

Gibbs\ndeveloped a theory of bivectors, in which he associated an ellipse with each\nbivector. He obtained results relating pairs of conjugate semi-diameters and in\nparticular considered the implications of the scalar product of two bivectors\nbeing zero. This paper is an attempt to develop a similar formulation for\nhyperbolas by the use of jay-vectors - a jay-vector is a linear combination\n$\\mathbf{a}+\\mathrm{j}\\mathbf{b}$ of real vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and\n$\\mathbf{b}$, where ${\\mathrm j}^2=+1$ but ${\\mathrm j}$ is not a real number,\nso ${\\mathrm j}\\neq\\pm1$. The implications of the vanishing of the scalar\nproduct of two jay-vectors is also considered. We show how to generate a triple\nof conjugate semi-diameters of an ellipsoid from any orthonormal triad. We also\nsee how to generate in a similar manner a triple of conjugate semi-diameters of\na hyperboloid and its conjugate hyperboloid.

As\na natural generalization of the original $3n+1$ problem, it consists of a\ndiscrete dynamical system of an arithmetical kind. Using standard methods of\nnumber theory and dynamical systems, general properties are established, such\nas the existence of finitely many periodic sequences for each $q$. In\nparticular, when $q$ is a Mersenne number, $q=2^p-1$, there only exists one\nsuch cycle, known as the trivial one. Further analysis based on a probabilistic\nmodel shows that for $q=3$ the asymptotic behavior of all sequences is always\nconvergent, whereas for $q\\geq 5$ the asymptotic behavior of the sequences is\ndivergent for almost all numbers (for a set of natural density one). This leads\nto the conclusion that the so called Collatz Conjecture is true, and that $q=3$\nis a very special case among the others (Crandall conjecture).

The\ndata discovered illustrate that the distribution of the first point of\ncoalescence is closely related to the solutions of some exponential diophantine\nequation. Afterwards, I show that the first point of coalescence of the\nintegers $n$ and $3n+2$ appear to tend to an expected value of $4/5n$. When the\nalgorithm was pushed to its peak estimation it has been discovered that the\nexpected value begins to deviate from the initial estimation of $4/5n$.

We mainly show that let $d$ be an invariant metric on a gyrogroup\n$G$ and $(\\widehat{G},\\widehat{d})$ is the metric completion of the metric\nspace $(G,d)$; then for any continuous $t$-norm $\\ast$, the standard fuzzy\nmetric space $(\\widehat{G},M_{\\widehat{d}},\\ast)$ of\n$(\\widehat{G},\\widehat{d})$ is the (up to isometry) unique fuzzy metric\ncompletion of the standard fuzzy metric space $(G,M_d,\\ast)$ of $(G,d)$;\nfurthermore, $(\\widehat{G},M_{\\widehat{d}},\\ast)$ is a fuzzy metric gyrogroup\ncontaining $(G,M_d,\\ast)$ as a dense fuzzy metric subgyrogroup and\n$M_{\\widehat{d}}$ is invariant on $\\widehat{G}$. Applying this result, we\nobtain that every gyrogroup $G$ with an invariant metric $d$ admits an (up to\nisometric) unique complete metric space $(\\widehat{G},\\widehat{d})$ of $(G,d)$\nsuch that $\\widehat{G}$ with the topology introduced by $\\widehat{d}$ is a\ntopology gyrogroup containing $G$ as a dense subgyrogroup and $\\widehat{d}$ is\ninvariant on $\\widehat{G}$.\n",

If the distance\nbetween the focal points of F1 - F2 is 2a (a: constant), then any point P on\nthe lemniscate curve satisfy the equation PF1 PF2 = a^2. Jacob Bernoulli first\ndescribed the lemniscate in 1694. The Fagnano discovered the double angle\nformula of the lemniscate(1718). The Euler extended the Fagnano's formula to a\nmore general addition theorem(1751). The lemniscate function was subsequently\nproposed by Gauss around the year 1800. These insights are summarized by Jacobi\nas the theory of elliptic functions. A leaf function is an extended lemniscate\nfunction. Some formulas of leaf functions have been presented in previous\npapers; these included the addition theorem of this function and its\napplication to nonlinear equations. In this paper, the geometrical properties\nof leaf functions at n = 2 and the geometric relation between the angle theta\nand lemniscate arc length l are presented using the lemniscate curve. The\nrelationship between the leaf functions sleaf2(l) and cleaf2(l) is derived\nusing the geometrical properties of the lemniscate, similarity of triangles,\nand the Pythagorean theorem. In the literature, the relation equation for\nsleaf2(l) and cleaf2(l) (or the lemniscate functions, sl(l) and cl(l)) has been\nderived analytically; however, it is not derived geometrically.\n",

The coefficients of these\nexpansions (Fourier coefficients) can be calculated using Euler formulas. We\nwill generalize this statement and show that the function $f(x)$ can also be\ndeveloped into non-sinusoidal periodic series, formed from the sum of the\nweighted components of a complete, non-orthogonal base: the unit function 1,\nthe fundamental quasi-harmonics $g(x)$, even and $h(x)$, odd ($2L$-periodic\nfunctions, with zero mean value over the definition interval) and the secondary\nquasi-harmonics $g_n(x)$ and $h_n(x)$ ($2L/n$-periodic functions), where $n\\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^+$. The fundamental quasi-harmonics $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are any\nfunctions which admit expansions in sinusoidal series (satisfy Dirichlet\nconditions, or belong to $L^2$ space). The coefficients of these expansions are\nobtained with the help of certain algebraic relationships between the Fourier\ncoefficients of the expansions of the functions $f(x)$, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. In\naddition to their obvious theoretical importance, these types of expansions can\nhave practical importance in the approximation of functions and in the\nnumerical and analytical resolution of certain classes of differential\nequations.\n",

Associated with the general\nquartic, there is a number of subsidiary quadratic equations (resolvent\nquadratic equations) whose roots allow this systematization as well as the\ndetermination of the bounds of the individual roots of the quartic. In many\ncases the root isolation intervals are found. The second tier of the analysis\nuses two subsidiary cubic equations (auxiliary cubic equations) and solving\nthese, together with some of the resolvent quadratic equations, allows the full\nclassification of the roots of the general quartic and also the determination\nof the isolation interval of each root. These isolation intervals involve the\nstationary points of the quartic (among others) and, by solving some of the\nresolvent quadratic equations, the isolation intervals of the stationary points\nof the quartic are also determined. Each possible case has been carefully\nstudied and illustrated with a detailed figure containing a description of its\nspecific characteristics, analysis based on solving cubic equations and\nanalysis based on solving quadratic equations only. As the analysis of the\nroots of the quartic equation is done by studying the intersection points of\nthe \"sub-quartic\" $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2$ with a set of suitable parallel lines, a\nbeautiful Pythagorean analogy can be found between these intersection points\nand the set of parallel lines on one hand and the musical notes and the staves\nrepresenting different musical pitches on the other: each particular case of\nthe quartic equation has its own short tune.\n",

From this, we derive a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for a quartic polynomial to be nonnegative and positive for all\nreals. Our condition explicitly exhibits the scope and role of some\ncoefficients, and has strong geometrical meaning. In the interior of the\nnonnegativity region for all reals, there is an appendix curve. The\ndiscriminant is zero at the appendix, and positive in the other part of the\ninterior of the nonnegativity region. By using the Sturm sequences, we present\na necessary and sufficient condition for a quintic polynomial to be positive\nand nonnegative for all positive reals. We show that for polynomials of a fixed\neven degree higher than or equal to four, if they have no real roots, then\ntheir discriminants take the same sign, which depends upon that degree only,\nexcept on an appendix set of dimension lower by two, where the discriminants\nattain zero.\n",

Instead of positing a singular principle, telos, or essence as\nnoumenon, we model it as plurality accessible through multiple forms of\nawareness (\"n-awareness\"). In contrast to many other approaches, our model is\ncommitted to pluralist thinking. The noumenon is plural, and reality is neither\nreducible nor irreducible. Nothing dies out in meaning making. We begin by\nmathematizing the concept of awareness by appealing to the mathematical\nformalism of higher category theory. The beauty of higher category theory lies\nin its universality. Pluralism is categorical. In particular, we model\nawareness using the theories of derived categories and $(\\infty, 1)$-topoi\nwhich will give rise to our meta-language. We then posit a \"grammar\"\n(\"n-declension\") which could express n-awareness, accompanied by a new temporal\nontology (\"n-time\"). Our framework allows us to revisit old problems in the\nphilosophy of time: how is change possible and what do we mean by simultaneity\nand coincidence? Another question which could be re-conceptualized in our model\nis one of soteriology related to this pluralism: what is a self in this\ncontext? A new model of \"personal identity over time\" is thus introduced.\n",

Only a few works concern totally symmetric\ntensors of higher-order. Work on other tensors of higher-order than two is\nexceptionally rare. We believe that one major reason for this gap is the lack\nof knowledge about suitable tensor decompositions for the general higher-order\ntensors. We focus here on three dimensions as most applications are concerned\nwith three-dimensional space. A lot of work on symmetric second-order tensors\nuses the spectral decomposition. The work on totally symmetric higher-order\ntensors deals frequently with a decomposition based on spherical harmonics.\nThese decompositions do not directly apply to general tensors of higher-order\nin three dimensions. However, another option available is the deviatoric\ndecomposition for such tensors, splitting them into deviators. Together with\nthe multipole representation of deviators, it allows to describe any tensor in\nthree dimensions uniquely by a set of directions and non-negative scalars. The\nspecific appeal of this methodology is its general applicability, opening up a\npotentially general route to tensor interpretation. The underlying concepts,\nhowever, are not broadly understood in the engineering community. In this\narticle, we therefore gather information about this decomposition from a range\nof literature sources. The goal is to collect and prepare the material for\nfurther analysis and give other researchers the chance to work in this\ndirection.

VGC was discovered by\nthe author of this paper in 2007, after which it was improved and extended (by\ncomputational verifications) until the present (2020). VGC distinguishes as a\nvery important \"meta-conjecture\" of primes because it states a new class\ncontaining an infinite number of conjectures stronger/stricter than GC. VGC has\ngreat potential importance in the optimization of the GC experimental\nverification (including other possible theoretical and practical applications\nin mathematics and physics). VGC can be also regarded as a very special\nself-similar property of the distribution of the primes. This present survey\ncontains some new results on VGC.\n",

Various\napproximations, that achieve the set relative error bounds of 10-4, 10-6, 10-10\nand 10-16, over the positive real, are specified. Applications include, first,\nthe definition of functions that are upper and lower bounds, of arbitrary\naccuracy, for the error function. Second, new series for the error function.\nThird, new sequences of approximations for exp(-x2) which have significantly\nhigher convergence properties that a Taylor series approximation. Fourth, the\ndefinition of a complementary demarcation function eC(x) which satisfies the\nconstraint eC(x)^2 + erf(x)^2 = 1. Fifth, arbitrarily accurate approximations\nfor the power and harmonic distortion for a sinusoidal signal subject to a\nerror function nonlinearity. Sixth, approximate expressions for the linear\nfiltering of a step signal that is modelled by the error function.\n",

Lack of commutativity and\nassociativity make it difficult to investigate algebraic and geometric\nproperties of octonions. It does not make sense to ask, for example, whether\nthe equation $x^2+1=0$ is solvable, without specifying the field in which we\nwant the solutions to be lie. The equation $x^2+1=0$ has no solutions in\n$\\mathbb{R}$, which is to say, there are no real numbers satisfying this\nequation. On the other hand, there are complex numbers which do satisfy this\nequation in the field $\\mathbb{C}$ of all complex numbers. How about if we\nextend the same idea to other two normed division algebras quaternions and\noctonions. Liping Huang and Wasin So derive explicit formulas for computing the\nroots of quaternionic quadratic equations. We extend their work to octonionic\ncase and solve monic left octonionic quadratic equation of the form\n$x^2+bx+c=0$, where $a,b$ are octonions in general.[ We called this form of\nquadratic equation as left octonion quadratic equation because we can consider\n$x^2+xb+c=0$ as a different case due to non-commutativity of octonions].\nFinally, we represent the left spectrum of $2\\times2$ octonionic matrix as a\nset of solutions to a corresponding octonionic quadratic equation, which is an\napplication of deriving explicit formulas for computing the roots of octonionic\nquadratic equations.\n",

Analytic solutions\nto the system and analytic characterization through governing equations provide\ninsights into the behaviors of DAEs as well as the parametric regions of\noperation for each potential behavior. For each system (DAEs), and choice of\ndependent variable, there is a corresponding governing equation which is\nunivariate ODE or PDE that is typically higher order than the constitutive\nequations of the system. We first introduce a direct formulation for\nrepresenting systems of linear DAEs. Unlike state space formulations, our\nformulation follows very directly from the system of constitutive equations\nwithout the need for introducing state variables or singular matrices. Using\nthis formulation for the system of constitutive equations (DAEs), we develop\nmethods for deriving analytic expressions for the full solution (complementary\nand particular) for all dependent variables of systems that consist of constant\ncoefficient ordinary-DAEs and special cases of partial-DAEs. We also develop\nmethods for deriving the governing equation for a chosen dependent variable for\nthe constant coefficient ordinary-DAEs and partial-DAEs as well as special\ncases of variable coefficient DAEs. The methods can be automated with symbolic\ncoding environments thereby allowing for dealing with systems of any size while\nretaining analytic nature. This is relevant for interpretable modeling,\nanalytic characterization and estimation, and engineering design in which the\nobjective is to tune parameter values to achieve specific behavior. Such\ninsights cannot directly be obtained using numerical simulations.\n",

We then state\nthree conjectures that enrich this framework. We first propose that the\n(infinity, 1)-category of a geometric structure known as perfectoid diamond is\nan (infinity, 1)-topos. In order to construct a topology on the (infinity,\n1)-category of diamonds we then propose that topological localization, in the\nsense of Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie (infinity, 1)-topoi, extends to the (infinity,\n1)-category of diamonds. We provide a small-scale model using triangulated\ncategories. Finally, our meta-model takes the form of Efimov K-theory of the\n(infinity, 1)-category of perfectoid diamonds, which illustrates structural\nequivalences between the category of diamonds and subjective experience (i.e.\nits privacy, self-containedness, and self-reflexivity). Based on this, we\ninvestigate implications of the model. We posit a grammar (\"n-declension\") for\na novel language to express n-awareness, accompanied by a new temporal scheme\n(\"n-time\"). Our framework allows us to revisit old problems in the philosophy\nof time: how is change possible and what do we mean by simultaneity and\ncoincidence? We also examine the notion of \"self\" within our framework. A new\nmodel of personal identity is introduced which resembles a categorical version\nof the \"bundle theory\"; selves are not substances in which properties inhere\nbut (weakly) persistent moduli spaces in the K-theory of perfectoid diamonds.\n",

At the `non-trivial' zeros of\nzeta function, value of the series is zero. Thus, Riemann hypothesis is false\nif that happens for an `s' off the line $\\Re(s)=1/2$ ( the critical line). This\nseries has two components $f(s)$ and $f(1-s)$. For the hypothesis to be false\none component is additive inverse of the other. From geometric analysis of\nspiral geometry representing the component series functions $f(s)$ and $f(1-s)$\non complex plane we find by contradiction that they cannot be each other's\nadditive inverse for any $s$, off the critical line. Thus, proving truth of the\nhypothesis.\n",

Conceptually, the process relies on the\npre-proven sequence data and the method follows the confirmation of the\nconvergence of the Collatz sequence for all the natural numbers in a sequential\nforward manner (ascending order of n). Hence, all the numbers less than n have\nbeen proved to converge before beginning to prove the convergence of the\nsequence for the number n.\n  Initially, the the nature of problem was explored and explained the reason\nfor some of the remarkable properties. Then, the pattern analysis of a first\nfew sequences data led to the concept of pre-proven sequence. Then, the origin\nof quartets and subsequently, the octet patterns are described. The \"Even-Odd\"\ncombinations and the concept of (8*v + c) gave a clear picture for the overall\nprocess of evaluation for the convergence. Then onwards, individual set of\nnumbers are analyzed and the convergence confirmations are arrived at. The\nprocess of computing involves the concept of combing. Finally, the compilation\nof all the sets together would give the completion of the proof.

        "summary": "  This paper is devoted to a nonlinear singular Riemann-Liouville type\nfractional differential equation, the local existence of whose continuous\nsolutions under the weakest condition remained as an open problem until now.\nThe singularity of the equation arises from the discontinuity of the right-hand\nside function $f(x,\\omega)$ at $x=0$, and its order of singularity is the same\nas the order of the fractional differential operator in the equation. The local\nexistence of solutions to singular equations of such type cannot be established\nby a direct application of fixed point theorems only or other methods even\nthough they are enough for the same purpose in the case of equations including\na singularity of the order less than the order of the corresponding fractional\nR-L operator. For this reason, we here propose a novel technique with a result\nfor continuous functions to establish a local existence theorem for the\nproblem. Moreover, a continuation result is suggested for the local solutions\nto the problem and, thus, it will be revealed that in what circumstances their\nexisting interval can be extended to larger ones. Thanks to this and the\nproposed technique, the global existence theorem for both sublinear and linear\nequations is achieved.\n",

        "summary": "  The famous (3n + 1) or Collatz conjecture has admitted some progress over the\nlast several decades towards the conclusion that the conjecture is true (i.e.\nthat all Collatz sequences will eventually reach a value of one), but has\nstubbornly resisted a proof. Many professional mathematicians have applied an\nimpressive array of machinery to its analysis, and discovered some limits or\nboundaries to where violations of the Collatz conjecture must be, if they\nexist. Here we attempt to look at the conjecture differently than most\nmathematicians or number theorists, i.e. we will study the conjecture from the\npoints of view of a statistician/data scientist and of an engineer. As a\nstatistician or data scientist, we look at Collatz sequences as if they were\nsequences found in nature, like a collection of time series produced by some\nnatural process, ignoring for the time being their completely deterministic\norigins. As an engineer, we try to tinker with Collatz sequences to see what\nmakes them tick, and engineer -- tweak and build -- changes to the sequences\nthat likewise do interesting things, after first specifying exactly what we\nmean by interesting. Although these analyses do not yield a proof of the\nCollatz conjecture, like other efforts they present reasons to think that the\nconjecture is probably true, and the hope is that the analyses of sequences\nsimilar to Collatz sequences will tell us something about the nature of Collatz\nconjecture itself, and/or lead us into interesting and fruitful new directions.\nIndeed, many of the phenomenon revealed in the sequences of these Collatz-like\nprograms are arguably more interesting than, and suggest conjectures that are\nas interesting as, the Collatz conjecture itself.\n",

How might these shapes be predicted, and how\ncan they eventually be designed? We review our current understanding of this\nproblem, that brings together analysis, geometry and mechanics in the\ndescription of the morphogenesis of low-dimensional objects. Starting from the\nview that shape is the consequence of metric frustration in an ambient space,\nwe examine the links between the classical Nash embedding problem and\nbiological morphogenesis. Then, motivated by a range of experimental\nobservations and numerical computations, we revisit known rigorous results on\ncurvature-driven patterning of thin elastic films, especially the asymptotic\nbehaviors of the solutions as the (scaled) thickness becomes vanishingly small\nand the local curvature can become large. Along the way, we discus open\nproblems that include those in mathematical modeling and analysis along with\nquestions driven by the allure of being able to tame soft surfaces for\napplications in science and engineering.\n",

We introduce two\ndistinct approaches to the concept of fuzzy ample spectrum contractions and we\nprove general results about existence and uniqueness of fixed points. The\nproposed notions enjoys the following advantages with respect to previous\napproaches: (1) they permit to develop fixed point theory in a very general\nfuzzy framework (for instance, the underlying fuzzy space is not necessarily\ncomplete); (2) the procedures that we employ are able to overcome the technical\ndrawbacks raising in fuzzy metric spaces in the sense of Kramosil and\nMich\\'alek (that do not appear in fuzzy metric spaces in the sense of George\nand Veeramani); (3) we introduce a novel property about sequences that are not\nCauchy in a fuzzy space in order to consider a more general context than\nnon-Archimedean fuzzy metric spaces; (4) the contractivity condition associated\nto fuzzy ample spectrum contractions does not have to be expressed in separate\nvariables; (5) such fuzzy contractions generalize some well-known families of\nfuzzy contractive operators such that the class of all Mihet's fuzzy\n$\\psi$-contractions.

        "summary": "  The 3N+1-problem, also known as The Collatz Conjecture, concerns the\nbehaviour of natural numbers N when the following rule is used repeatedly: If N\nis odd then multiply N by three and add one (a type Odd operation/ iteration),\nif N is even divide N by two (a type Even operation/ iteration).\n  The Collatz Conjecture states that for any N as start-value the\niteration-series must eventually reach the known Loop -4-2-1-4-... In the\npresent work is shown that all iteration-series reach a value lower than the\nstart-value, N > 1, at some point in the iteration-series, which is equivalent\nto showing that all iteration-series also reaches the known Loop. This is done\nby analysing the behaviour of subsets of the natural numbers. The subsets are\ncalled classes: (AX-B), B < A, where the independent variable X is a positive\ninteger, the modulo A is a positive integer and the constant B is a\nnon-negative integer. It is shown that there exist a countable infinity of\n\"reducing\" classes e.g. all elements in the class (2X) = {2,4,6,8,10,...} are\nreduced in one type Even operation and all elements in the class (4X-3) =\n{1,5,9,13,17,...} are reduced in one type Odd operation followed by two type\nEven operations.\n  A formula is deduced that for any number of type Odd operations, #O = s,\ndelivers the exact number of type Even operations, #E = r, required to obtain a\n\"reducing combination\" of operations: r = ceiling(sZ), s > 0, Z = log3/log2 =\n1,5849625007...\n  Another formula is deduced that for any \"reducing combination\"\n(s,ceiling(sZ)), s > 1, delivers the exact number of \"reducing\" classes having\nmodulo A = 2^ceiling(sZ). By the help of a graph in form of an infinite\ncomplete binary tree it is then shown that all natural numbers N must belong to\nexactly one \"reducing\" class, thus proving that The Collatz Conjecture is true.\n",

The algorithm is exponential in\ncomplexity, but the well-known algorithms, such as the extended Euclidean\nalgorithm and Buchberger's algorithm, are superexponential. The\nsuperexponential complexity of the well-known algorithms is due to their not\nbeing \"minimal\" in a certain sense. Buchberger's algorithm produces a Groebner\nbasis. The proposed original reduction algorithm achieves the required task,\nvia computation of determinants of parametric Sylvester matrices, and produces\na Rabin basis, which is shown to be minimal, when two multivariate polynomials\nare reduced at a time. The minimality of Rabin basis allows us to prove\nexponential lower bounds for the space complexity of an algebraic proof of\ncertification, for a specific computational problem in the computational\ncomplexity class PSPACE, showing that the complexity classes PSPACE and P\ncannot be the same. By the same reasoning, it follows that Co-NP is not the\nsame as either of the complexity classes NP and P, and that the polynomial time\nhierarchy does not collapse. It is also shown that the class BPP of languages\ndecidable by bounded error probabilistic algorithms with (probabilistic)\npolynomial time proofs for the membership of input words is not the same as any\none of the complexity classes P, NP and Co-NP. It follows again, from the\ndiscussions, that the complexity classes NP and P are not the same, by\nrelativization of BPP, with respect to P and NP.\n",

The method is illustrated with the full analysis of\none of the possible cases. Some of the roots of the symbolic quintic equation\nfor this case have their isolation intervals determined and, as this cannot be\ndone for all roots with the help of quadratic equations only, finite intervals\ncontaining 1 or 3 roots, or 0 or 2 roots, or, rarely, 0, or 2, or 4 roots of\nthe quintic are identified. Knowing the stationary points of the quintic\npolynomial, lifts the latter indeterminacy and allows one to find the isolation\ninterval of each of the roots of the quintic. Separately, using the complete\nroot classification of the quintic, one can also lift this indeterminacy. The\nmethod also allows to see how variation of the individual coefficients of the\nquintic affect its roots.

We optimize our analytical procedure\nby defining a more general test function that depends explicitly on the\nabscissa variable sigma, and present a procedure to find non-trivial roots\nalong the critical line, as demanded by Riemann Hypothesis, thus confirming it.\nOur method even allows us to define a function, that behaves analogous to the\nRiemann zeta function, and that even admits a functional type equation.\n",

A homotopic nerve results from the nonvoid intersection of a\ncollection of homotopic 1-cycles. Briefly, a 1-cycle is a finite sequence of\npath-connected vertexes with no end vertex and with a nonvoid interior. A\nhomotopic 1-cycle has the structure of a 1-cycle in a CW space in which cycle\nedges are replaced by homotopic maps. A group $G(V,+)$ containing a basis\n$\\mathcal{B}$ is {\\em free}, provided every member of $V$ can be written as a\nlinear combination of elements (generators) of the basis $\\mathcal{B}\\subset\nV$.

Such a result allows to generalize the use of complex numbers in\nclassical algebra. Having now two finitely generated differential modules $L$\nand $M$ over the non-commutative ring ring $D=K[d_1,... ,d_n]=K[d]$ of\ndifferential operators with coefficients in $K$, we may similarly look for a\ndifferential module $N$ containing both $L$ and $M$ in order to define $L\\cap\nM$ and $L+M$.

However, in many recent books and papers, we have shown that\ncontrollability was a {\\it built-in} property of a control system, not\ndepending on the choice of inputs and outputs. The main purpose of this paper\nis to revisit control theory by showing the specific importance of the two\nprevious problems and the part plaid by $N$ in both cases for the\nparametrization of the control system. The essential tool will be the study of\n{\\it differential correspondences}, a modern name for what was called {\\it\nB\\\"{a}cklund problem} during the last century, namely the study of elimination\ntheory for groups of variables among systems of linear or nonlinear OD or PD\nequations. The difficulty is to revisit {\\it differential homological algebra}\nby using non-commutative localization. Finally, when $M$ is a $D$-module, this\npaper is using for the first time the fact that the system $R=hom_K(M,K)$ is a\n$D$-module for the Spencer operator acting on sections.\n",

All possible cases are presented with clear and very\ndetailed diagrams. It is very easy to identify which of these diagrams is the\nrelevant one for any given cubic equation and to read from it the isolation\nintervals of the real roots of the equation. A much-improved complete root\nclassification, addressing the signs (together with giving the isolation\nintervals) of the individual roots, is also presented. No numerical\napproximations or root finding techniques are used. Instead of considering the\ndiscriminant of the cubic, criterion for the existence of a single real root or\nthree real roots is found as conditions on the coefficients of the cubic,\nresulting from the roots of the auxiliary quadratic equations. It is also shown\nthat, if a cubic equation has three real roots, then these lie in an interval\n$I$ such that $\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{a^2/3 - b} \\le I \\le 2 \\sqrt{a^2/3 - b}$,\nindependent of $c$.

However, determining whether a point in the strip is a zero of a\ncomplex function is a challenging task. Bombieri proposed an assertion in the\nOfficial Problem Description that states, ``The Riemann hypothesis is\nequivalent to the statement that all local maxima of $\\xi(t)$ (namely $\\xi(s)$\non the critical line) are positive and all local minima are negative.\" In this\npaper, we follow Bombieri's idea to study the Riemann hypothesis. First, we\nshow that on the critical line, the $\\xi(s)$ function (which is then a real\nfunction of a single real variable) obeys a special differential equation, such\nthat it satisfies Bombieri's equivalence condition. Then, since we have been\nunable to locate the original proof of Bombieri's equivalence theorem, we\nindependently provide a proof for the sufficiency part of it. Namely, if the\n$\\xi(s)$ function satisfies Bombieri's equivalence condition on the critical\nline, then by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, it has no zeros outside this\ncritical line. Thus, we can conclude that the Riemann hypothesis is true.\nFinally, we discuss P\\'olya's counterexample, which is against the use of\nJensen's form of the $\\xi(s)$ function to study the Riemann hypothesis.

        "summary": "  What are simplest ways to construct a finite group from its atomic\nconstituents? To understand part-whole relations between finite simple groups\nand the global structure of finite groups, we axiomatize complexity measures on\nfinite groups. From the Jordan-H\\\"older theorem and Frobenius-Lagrange\nembedding in an iterated wreath product, any finite group $G$ can be\nconstructed from a unique collection of simple groups, its Jordan-H\\\"older\nfactors, each with well-defined multiplicities through iterated extension. What\nis the least number of levels needed in such a hierarchical construction if a\nlevel is allowed to include several of these atomic pieces? To answer this\nquestion rigorously, we give a natural set of hierarchical complexity axioms\nfor finite groups, and prove these axioms are satisfied by a unique maximal\ncomplexity function $\\mathbf{cx}$. We prove this function is the same as the\nminimal number of \"spans of gems\" (direct products of simple groups) in a\nsubnormal series with all factors of this type. This hierarchical complexity is\nthus effectively computable, and bounded below by all other complexity measures\nsatisfying the axioms, including generalizations of derived length and Fitting\nheight.\n  For solvable groups, the unique maximal group complexity measure satisfying\nthe axioms agrees with the restriction of the one for all finite groups, and in\naddition satisfies an embedding axiom. In both cases, the complexity of a group\nis bounded above and below by various natural functions. In particular,\nhierarchical complexity is sharply bounded above by socle length, with a\ncanonical decomposition. Examples illustrate applications of the bounds and\naxiomatic methods in determining complexity of groups. We show also that\nminimal decompositions need not be unique in terms of what components occur nor\ntheir ordering. The complexity axioms are also shown to be independent.\n",

In this article, we investigate the\nfollowing issues: (i) We recall the Fibonacci sequence, the golden ratio, their\nproperties and applications, and some early generalizations of the golden\nratio. The Fibonacci sequence is a $2$-sequence because it is generated by the\nsum of two previous terms, $f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_{n}$. As a natural extension\nof this, we introduce several typical $p$-sequences where every term is the sum\nof $p$ previous terms given $p$ initial values called \"seeds\". In particular,\nwe introduce the notion of $1$-sequence. We then discuss generating functions\nand limiting ratio values of $p$-sequences. Furthermore, inspired by\nFibonacci's rabbit pair problem, we consider a general problem whose particular\ncases lead to nontrivial additive sequences.

(2) Reminiscent of the Fundamental\nTheorem of Asset Pricing, absence of arbitrage is equivalent to the existence\nof a complete preference order which consistently extends a market's fair\nexchange relation and its objective strict preference order.

An\napproach is also proposed in which the real, negative multiplicities are\nallowed, implying the multiset universe to become finite and well-defined,\ncorresponding to the multiset with null multiplicities. The complement\noperation in multisets is then defined, which allows properties involving\ncomplement -- including the De Morgan theorem -- to be recovered in multisets.\nIn addition, it becomes possible to extend multisets to functions (which become\nmultifunctions), scalar fields and other continuous mathematical structure,\ntherefore achieving an enhanced space endowed with all algebraic operations\nplus set theoretical operations including union, intersection, and\ncomplementation. The possibility to define a set operation between mfunctions,\nnamely the common product, that is analogous to the traditional inner product\nis also proposed, paving the way to obtaining respective mfunction\ntransformations, and it is argued that the Walsh functions provide an\northogonal basis for the mfunctions space under the common product. This result\nalso allowed the proposal of performing integrated signal processing operations\non mset mfunctions, including filtering and enhanced template matching.\nRelationships between the cosine similarity index and the Jaccard index are\nalso identified, including the presentation of an intersection-based variation\nof the cosine index.

Tychonoff's theorem is shown\nto be equivalent to the axiom of choice. In this paper, we show that any\ncountable product of compact metric spaces is compact, without using\nTychonoff's theorem. The proof needs only basic and standard facts of compact\nmetric spaces and the Bolzano-Weierstrass property. Moreover, the component\nspaces need not be assumed to be copies of the same compact metric space, and\neach component space can be an arbitrary nonempty compact metric space\nindependently. Total boundedness together with completeness of a metric space\nimplies its compactness. Completeness of a product of complete spaces is easily\ninferred from the completeness of each component. Total boundedness therefore\nsuffices to prove the compactness of a product space consisting of countably\n(infinitely) many nonempty compact component spaces. The countable infiniteness\nis needed in the proof to exhibit a standard metric that gives rise to the\nproduct topology. Any such metric topology for the product arises as exhibited,\nand they are all equivalent to the product topology. The requirement of\nsummability of the sequences restricts the scope of the result to countably\ninfinite products. In summary, the product space obtained by taking the product\nof any sequence of nonempty compact metric spaces in the product topology is\nshown to be compact, using only the basic and standard facts of compact metric\nspaces. In conclusion, compactness of the product of a countably infinitely\nmany nonempty compact metric spaces can be proved within Cantor's set theory,\nwithout using the axiom of choice and Tychonoff's theorem.\n",

In these works, the proposed approaches to formulate this\ncalculus are based either on the power of one Sonine kernel, or the convolution\nof one Sonine kernel with the kernels of the integer-order integrals. To apply\ngeneral fractional calculus, it is useful to have a wider range of operators,\nfor example, by using the Laplace convolution of different types of kernels. In\nthis paper, an extended formulation of the general fractional calculus of\narbitrary order is proposed. Extension is achieved by using different types\n(subsets) of pairs of operator kernels in definitions general fractional\nintegrals and derivatives. For this, the definition of the Luchko pair of\nkernels is somewhat broadened, which leads to the symmetry of the definition of\nthe Luchko pair. The proposed set of kernel pairs are subsets of the Luchko set\nof kernel pairs. The fundamental theorems for the proposed general fractional\nderivatives and integrals are proved.\n",

Some pure mathematical concepts we are led to are\nGraver, Gr\\\"{o}bner, lattice and circuit bases, combinatorial geometry and\ndifferential algebra, and algebraic-differential equations. Two techniques are\ncoordinated: classical dimensional analysis (DA) in applied mathematics and\nscience, and a polynomial and differential-polynomial formulation of asymptotic\nexpansions, referred to here as Newton-Puiseux (NP) expansions. The latter\nleads to power series with rational exponents, which depend on the choice of\nthe dominant part of the equations, often referred to as the method of\n\"dominant balance\". The paper shows, using a new approach to DA based on toric\nideals, how dimensionally homogeneous equations may best be\nnon-dimensionalised, and then, with examples involving differential equations,\nuses recent work on NP expansions to show how non-dimensional parameters affect\nthe results.

For this\nmethod there exists some convergence results which are practically not very\nuseful and just guarantee the convergence of this method when the first term of\nthis sequence is very close to the guessed root \\cite{sulimayer}. Khandani et\nal. introduced a new iterative method to estimate the roots of real-valued\nfunctions \\cite{khandani}. Using this method we introduce some simple and\neasy-to-test conditions under which Newton-Raphson sequence converges to its\nguessed root even when the initial point is chosen very far from this root.\nMore clearly, for a real-valued second differentiable function $f:[a,c]\\to\n\\mathbb R$ with $f^{''}f\\ge 0$ on $(a,c)$ where $c$ is the unique root of $f$\nin $[a,c]$, the Newton-Raphson sequence $f$ converges to $c$ for each\n$x_0\\in[a,c]$ provided $f$ satisfies some other simple conditions on this\ninterval. A similar result holds if $[a,c]$ be replaced with $[c,b]$. Our study\nwill enable us to predict accurately where Newton-Raphson sequence converges.\n",

        "summary": "  Omar Khayyam's studies on cubic equations inspired the 12th century Persian\nmathematician Sharaf al-Din Tusi to investigate the number of positive roots.\nAccording to the noted mathematical historian Rashed, Tusi analyzed the problem\nfor five different types of equations. In fact all cubic equations are\nreducible to a form {\\it Tusi form} $x^2-x^3=c$. Tusi determined that the\nmaximum of $x^2-x^3$ on $(0,1)$ occurs at $\\frac{2}{3}$ and concluded when\n$c=\\frac{4}{27} \\delta$, $\\delta \\in (0,1)$, there are roots in $(0,\n\\frac{2}{3})$ and $(\\frac{2}{3},1)$, ignoring the root in $(-\\frac{1}{3},0)$.\nGiven a {\\it reduced form} $x^3+px+q=0$, when $p <0$, we show it is reducible\nto a Tusi form with $\\delta = \\frac{1}{2} + {3\\sqrt{3} q}/{4\\sqrt{-p^3}}$. It\nfollows there are three real roots if and only if $\\Delta\n=-(\\frac{q^2}{4}+\\frac{p^3}{27})$ is positive. This gives an explicit\nconnection between $\\delta$ in Tusi form and $\\Delta$ in Cardano's formula.\nThus when $\\delta \\in (0,1)$, rather than using Cardano's formula in complex\nnumbers one can approximate the roots iteratively. On the other hand, for a\nreduced form with $p >0$ we give a novel proof of Cardono's formula. While\nRashed attributes Tusi's computation of the maximum to the use of derivatives,\naccording to Hogendijk, Tusi was probably influenced by Euclid. Here we show\nthe maximizer in Tusi form is computable via elementary algebraic\nmanipulations. Indeed for a {\\it quadratic Tusi form}, $x-x^2=\\delta/4$, Tusi's\napproach results in a simple derivation of the quadratic formula, comparable\nwith the pedagogical approach of Po-Shen Loh. Moreover, we derive analogous\nresults for the {\\it general Tusi form}. Finally, we present a novel derivation\nof Khayyam's geometric solution. The results complement previous findings on\nTusi's work and reveal further facts on history, mathematics and pedagogy in\nsolving cubic equations.\n",

Consequently, much of this article focuses on exploring\ndifferent concepts of entropy as a measure of disorder, and how symmetries can\nhelp in reliable self replication, both at the level of assembly (by reducing\nthe number of wrong ways that parts could be assembled), and also as a parity\ncheck when replicas manufacture parts generation after generation.

Both constructions have later been\nsimplified by the author. Here we refine our simplified approach in order to\nobtain similar results for regular parallelisms of oriented lines. As a\nconsequence, we can demonstrate that for oriented parallelisms, as we call\nthem, there are distinctly more possibilities than in the non-oriented case.\nThe proofs require a thorough analysis of orientation in projective spaces (as\nmanifolds and as lattices) and in projective planes and, in particular, in\ntranslation planes. This is used in order to handle continuous families of\noriented regular spreads in terms of the Klein model of PG(3,R). This turns out\nto be quite subtle.

In Greece, distance learning\nstarted to get in use widely in tertiary education, since the first national\nlockdown was announced and reshaped education in many ways. In the University\nof Thessaly, in the Department of Mathematics, undergraduate students opt a lot\nof different courses to attend and due to the Covid-19 crisis all of them are\ntaught via web platforms. Some of the most significant theoretical subjects are\n\"Calculus\" (with applications in Science and Mechanics), \"Physics\" (Classical\nMechanics) and \"Philosophy of Science\". In addition, some other applied\nsubjects are \"Programming Languages\" and \"Digital Technologies in Mathematics\nEducation\" and the impact the above have, generally in education and society\nitself. In this paper, we describe the different ways students have reacted\nregarding learning Sciences in a distance learning environment. We split our\ncase study in two parts. The first one is about the way students experience\ne-learning and the second one is about their suggestions for the next day.\nIntegrating e-questionnaires and interviews and taking into account parameters\nlike economic factors and the permanent residence issue, we asked the students\nabout their preferences among face-to-face learning, distance learning and a\nblended model. Remarks about the academic life and the possible ways of taking\nthe extra step, after the Covid-19 crisis ceases to exist, are made.\n",

Conjectures from such problems\nare known to be intractable and only few partial results exist until now. In\nthis paper, we study a family of perturbed sequences of rational powers called\n'Branch sequences' of the form \\left( S_{n}=\\left( \\xi+\\Sigma_{n} \\right)\\left(\n\\frac{p^{n}}{q^{n+e_{n}}} \\right) \\right)_{n\\ge 0}. Under the assumption that\nsuch sequences are deterministic and they have controlled positive\nperturbations, we establish the convergence result: min_{n\\ge 0}(S_{n})\\le\nq^{2}. As an application, we show that Syracuse sequences are 'Branch\nsequences' with all the required conditions for convergence and therefore this\nconfirms the Collatz conjecture.\n  Keywords: Sequences of rational powers, Syracuse conjecture, Collatz problem,\n3x+1 problem.\n",

While\nthe two maps are computationally identical, only $J$ is coordinate-free and\nprovides direct support for geometric duality, whereby every geometric\nprimitive appears twice, once as a point-based and once as a plane-based form,\nan essential feature not only of projective geometry but also of euclidean\nkinematics and dynamics.

For the order structure, many efforts are\ndevoted to constructing some score functions, which can strictly distinguish\ndifferent intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) and preserve the natural partial\norder for IFVs.This paper proves that such a score function does not exist,\nnamely the application of a single monotonous and continuous function does not\ndistinguish all IFVs. For the distance or similarity measure, some examples are\ngiven to show that classical similarity measures based on the normalized\nEuclidean distance and normalized Minkowski distance do not meet the axiomatic\ndefinition of intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measures. Moreover,some\nillustrative examples are given to show that classical intuitionistic fuzzy\nTOPSIS methods do not ensure the monotonicity with the natural partial order or\nlinear orders, which may yield some counter-intuitive results. To overcome the\nlimitation of non-monotonicity, we propose a novel intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS\nmethod,using three new admissible distances with the linear orders measured by\na score degree/similarity function and accuracy degree, or two aggregation\nfunctions, and prove that the proposed TOPSIS method is monotonous under these\nthree linear orders.} This is the first result with a strict mathematical proof\non the monotonicity with the linear orders for the intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS\nmethod.\n",

In his paper (D. A. Molodtsov, Equivalence and correct operations\nfor soft sets.

To be more effective for\ndecision-making and pattern recognition applications, a good normalized\ndistance measure should ensure that its dual similarity measure satisfies the\naxiomatic definition. In this paper, we first construct some examples to\nillustrate that the dual similarity measures of two nonlinear distance measures\nintroduced in [A distance measure for intuitionistic fuzzy sets and its\napplication to pattern classification problems, \\emph{IEEE Trans. Syst., Man,\nCybern., Syst.}, vol.~51, no.~6, pp. 3980--3992, 2021] and [Intuitionistic\nfuzzy sets: spherical representation and distances, \\emph{Int. J. Intell.\nSyst.}, vol.~24, no.~4, pp. 399--420, 2009] do not meet the axiomatic\ndefinition of intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measure. We show that (1) they\ncannot effectively distinguish some intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) with\nobvious size relationship; (2) except for the endpoints, there exist infinitely\nmany pairs of IFVs, where the maximum distance 1 can be achieved under these\ntwo distances; leading to counter-intuitive results. To overcome these\ndrawbacks, we introduce the concepts of strict intuitionistic fuzzy distance\nmeasure (SIFDisM) and strict intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measure (SIFSimM),\nand propose an improved intuitionistic fuzzy distance measure based on\nJensen-Shannon divergence. We prove that (1) it is a SIFDisM; (2) its dual\nsimilarity measure is a SIFSimM; (3) its induced entropy is an intuitionistic\nfuzzy entropy. Comparative analysis and numerical examples demonstrate that our\nproposed distance measure is completely superior to the existing ones.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper, we introduce a type of latticized optimization problem whose\nobjective function is the maximum component function and the feasible region is\ndefined as a system of fuzzy relational equalities (FRE) defined by the Dombi\nt-norm. Dombi family of t-norms includes a parametric family of continuous\nstrict t-norms, whose members are increasing functions of the parameter. This\nfamily of t-norms covers the whole spectrum of t-norms when the parameter is\nchanged from zero to infinity. Since the feasible solutions set of FREs is\nnon-convex and the finding of all minimal solutions is an NP-hard problem,\ndesigning an efficient solution procedure for solving such problems is not a\ntrivial job. Some necessary and sufficient conditions are derived to determine\nthe feasibility of the problem. The feasible solution set is characterized in\nterms of a finite number of closed convex cells. An algorithm is presented for\nsolving this nonlinear problem. It is proved that the algorithm can find the\nexact optimal solution and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed\nalgorithm.\n",

In particular, we prove that for\nisotropic functions that depend on $P$ vectors, $N$ symmetric tensors and $M$\nnon-symmetric tensors (a) the number of irreducible invariants for a\nscalar-valued isotropic function is $3P+9M+6N-3$ (b) the number of irreducible\nvectors for a vector-valued isotropic function is $3$ and (c) the number of\nirreducible tensors for a tensor-valued isotropic function is at most $9$.

This significant reduction in the number of\nirreducible scalar/vector/tensor-valued functions have the potential to\nsubstantially simplify modelling complexity.\n",

Such a characterization leads to the\ndetermination of several numbers (integers or non-integers) that we call the\ncharacteristic numbers of a given parity vector. Some characteristic numbers\nare linked together by equations that can be called characteristic equations of\nthe considered parity vector. If a parity vector v of finite length n contains\nthe first n terms of a parity vector V of infinite length then all the\ncharacteristic numbers of v are considered as characteristic numbers of order n\nof the infinite vector V. The limits of nth order characteristic numbers when n\ntends to infinity constitute the absolute characteristic numbers of the\ninfinite vector V and they allow determining its behavior and properties. In\nthis paper, we study the properties of parity vectors of infinite length based\non their characteristic numbers. Then, we establish the relations between the\nfirst term of a Collatz sequence and its parity vector. Finally, still based on\nthe characteristic numbers, we determine some conditions of existence and\nnon-existence of divergent sequences.\n",

There is only one kind of iteration if the root is odd and two kinds\nif the root is even. I also show that iterations on numbers with odd roots will\ncause an increase in value and eventually lead to an even rooted number. The\niterations on even rooted numbers will subsequently cause a decrease in values.\nBecause increase in values during the odd root iterations are bounded, I\nconclude that the Collatz iteration cannot veer to infinity. Since the sequence\ngenerated by the Collatz iteration is infinite and the values of the numbers do\nnot veer to infinity it must either cycle and/or converge. I postulate that any\ncycling must occur with alternating types of iterations: e.g. odd rooted\niterations which cause the values of the numbers to increase followed by even\nrooted iterations which causes the values to decrease. I show here that for\nsimpler types of cycles, valid values of odd rooted or even rooted numbers are\nonly found in a narrow gap which closes as the number of iterations increase. I\nfurther generalize to all types of odd-even and even-odd iterations. Given that\nprevious work has shown that only very large non-trivial cycles are feasible\nduring the Collatz iteration and this study shows the low probability of large\nsimple cycles, leads us to the conclusion most likely cycles other than the\ntrivial cycle are not possible during the Collatz iteration.\n",

        "summary": "  The primary objectives of this paper are to present the construction of\nbivariate fractal interpolation functions over triangular interpolating domain\nusing the concept of vertex coloring and to propose a double integration\nformula for the constructed interpolation functions. Unlike the conventional\nconstructions, each vertex in the partition of the triangular region has been\nassigned a color such that the chromatic number of the partition is 3. A new\nmethod for the partitioning of the triangle is proposed with a result\nconcerning the chromatic number of its graph. Following the construction, a\nformula determining the vertical scaling factor is provided. With the newly\ndefined vertical scaling factor, it is clearly observed that the value of the\ndouble integral coincides with the integral value calculated using fractal\ntheory. Further, a relation connecting the fractal interpolation function with\nthe equation of the plane passing through the vertices of the triangle is\nestablished. Convergence of the proposed method to the actual integral value is\nproven with sufficient lemmas and theorems. Sufficient examples are also\nprovided to illustrate the method of construction and to verify the formula of\ndouble integration.\n",

In the first part of this paper, we investigate\na stricter version of the conjecture, expressed as follows: ''Let $p_{n}$ be\nthe n-th prime. Then, there always exist twin primes between $(p_{n}-2)^{2}$\nand $p_{n}^{2}$ ''.

We also analyse what should happen for higher values of $p_{n}$.\nIn the second part, we investigate the validity of the general Polignac's\nConjecture. We predict the ratio of the number of solutions for any value of M\ndivided by the number of solutions for M = 2, and explain how this ratio\ndepends on the factorization of M.

Even though,\nthe story of fuzzy logic started much earlier, it was specially designed\nmathematically to represent uncertainty and vagueness. It was also, to provide\nformalized tools for dealing with the imprecision intrinsic to many problems. A\ngroup is said to be nilpotent if it has a normal series of a finite length n.\nBy this notion, every finite p-group is nilpotent. Nilpotent structures such as\nthe p-groups, have normal series of finite length. Any finite p-group has many\nnormal subgroups and consequently, the phenomenon of large number of\nnon-isomorphic subgroups of a given order. This makes it an ideal object for\ncombinatorial and cohomological investigations. Cartesian product (otherwise\nknown as the product set) plays vital roles in the course of synthesizing the\nabstract groups. Previous studies have determined the number of distinct fuzzy\nsubgroups of various finite p-groups including those of square-free order.\nHowever, not much work has been done on the fuzzy subgroup classification for\nthe nilpotent groups formed from the Cartesian products of p-groups through\ntheir computations. This work is therefore designed to classify the nilpotent\ngroups formed from the Cartesian products of p-groups through their\ncomputations. In this paper, the Cartesian products of p-groups were taken to\nobtain nilpotent groups. the explicit formulae is given for the number of\ndistinct fuzzy subgroups of the Cartesian product of the dihedral group of\norder eight with a cyclic group of order of an n power of two for, which n is\nnot less than three\n",

        "summary": "  The power operation of continuous Archimedean triangular norms (t-norms) is\nfundamental for generalizing the multiplication and power operations of\nintuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) within the framework of continuous Archimedean\nt-norms. However, due to the lack of systematic research on the power operation\nof general continuous t-norms in theory, it greatly limits the further\ngeneralization of the multiplication and power operations for IFSs via general\ncontinuous t-norms. This paper aims to investigate the power operation of\ncontinuous t-norms and develop some IF information aggregation methods. In\ntheory, it is proved that a continuous t-norm is power stable if and only if\nevery point is a power stable point, and if and only if it is the minimum\nt-norm, or it is strict, or it is an ordinal sum of strict t-norms. Moreover,\nthe representation theorem of continuous t-norms is used to obtain the\ncomputational formula for the power of continuous t-norms. Based on the power\noperation of t-norms, four fundamental operations induced by a continuous\nt-norm for the IFSs are introduced. Furthermore, various IF aggregation\noperators based on these four fundamental operations, namely the IF weighted\naverage (IFWA), IF weighted geometric (IFWG), and IF mean weighted average and\ngeometric (IFMWAG) operators, are defined, and their properties are analyzed.\nIn application, a new decision-making algorithm is designed based on the IFMWAG\noperator, which can remove the hindrance of indiscernibility on the boundaries\nof some classical aggregation operators. The practical applicability,\ncomparative analysis, and advantages of the study with other decision-making\nmethods are furnished to ascertain the efficacy of the designed method.\n",

The purpose of this paper\nis to present an elementary summary of a few recent results obtained through\nthe application of the formal theory of systems of OD or PD equations and Lie\npseudogroups to engineering (elasticity, electromagnetism) or mathematical\nphysics (general relativity, gauge theory) and their couplings\n(piezoelectricity, photoelasticity). The work of Cartan is superseded by the\nuse of the canonical Spencer sequence while the work of Vessiot is superseded\nby the use of the canonical Janet sequence but the link between these two\nsequences and thus these two works is still not known today. Using differential\nduality in the linear framework, the adjoint of the Spencer operator for the\ngroup of conformal transformations provides the Cosserat equations, the Maxwell\nequations and the Weyl equations on equal footing. Such a result allows to\nunify the finite elements of engineering sciences but also leads to deep\ncontradictions in the case of gravitational waves. Indeed, the Beltrami\noperator (1892) which is parametrizing the Cauchy operator of elasticity by\nmeans of 6 stress functions is nothing else than the self-adjoint Einstein\noperator (1915) in dimension 3 for the deformation of the metric which is\nparametrizing the div operator induced from the Bianchi identities. The same\nconfusion between the Cauchy and div operators is existing on space-time as the\nCauchy operator can be parametrized by the adjoint of the Ricci operator.\nAccordingly, the foundations of engineering and mathematical physics must be\nrevisited within this new framework, though striking it may sometimes look\nlike.\n",

GGC is checked up to $10^{12}d$ for all (up to\n$10^{13}d$ for some) pairs of coefficients $m_1, m_2$, where $d=\\gcd{(m_1,\nm_2)}$ and $m_1/d, m_2/d \\leq 40$. The largest counterexamples found that\ncannot be obtained in this form are presented. Their relatively small sizes\nsupport the plausibility of GGC. Lemoine's conjecture is verified up to a new\nrecord of $10^{13}$. Four naturally arising verifying algorithms are described\nand their running times compared for every $m_1\\leq m_2\\leq 40$ relatively\nprime. These seek to find either the $p$- or the $q$-minimal $(m_1,\nm_2)$-partitions of all numbers tested, by either descending or ascending\nsearch for the prime to be maximised or minimised, respectively, in the\npartitions. For all $m_1, m_2$ descending searches were faster than ascending\nones. A heuristic explanation is provided. The relative speed of ascending\n[descending] searches for the $p$- and for the $q$-minimal partitions,\nrespectively, varied by $m_1, m_2$. Using the average of $p^*_{m_1, m_2}(n)$ -\nthe minimal $p$ in all $(m_1, m_2)$-partitions of $n$ - up to a sufficiently\nlarge threshold, two functions of $m_1, m_2$ are introduced, which may help\npredict these rankings. Our predictions correspond well with actual rankings.\nThese could be further improved by developing approximations to $p^*_{m_1,\nm_2}(n)$. Numerical data are presented, including average and maximum values of\n$p^*_{m_1, m_2}(n)$ up to $10^9$.

More specifically, if there exists reduced\ndynamics of x (that is, start from an integer x and the computation will go to\nan integer less than x), then there must also exist reduced dynamics of x+P\n(that is, if starting from an integer x+P, then computation will go to an\ninteger less than x+P), where P equals 2 to the power of L, and L is the total\ncount of x/2 computations (i.e., computational times) in the reduced dynamics\nof x (note that, equivalently, L is also the length of the reduced dynamics of\nx). Therefore, the power (or output) of this period property, which is\ndiscovered and proved in this paper, is - the study of the existence of reduced\ndynamics of x will result in the existence of reduced dynamics of x+P (and\niteratively x+n*P, n is a positive integer). Hence, only partition of integers\nneeds to be verified for the existence of their reduced dynamics.

Reduced Collatz Conjecture is easier to explore\nbecause certain structures must be presented in reduced dynamics, rather than\nin original dynamics (as original dynamics is a mixture of original dynamics).\nReduced dynamics is a computation sequence from starting integer to the first\ninteger less than it, in terms of ``I'' that represents (3*x+1)/2 and ``O''\nthat represents x/2. We formally prove that all positive integers are\npartitioned into two halves and either presents ``I'' or ``O'' in next ongoing\ncomputation. More specifically, (1) if any positive integer x that is i module\n$2^t$ (i is an odd integer) is given, then the first t computations (each one\nis either ``I'' or ``O'' corresponding to whether current integer is odd or\neven) will be identical with that of i. (2) If current integer after t\ncomputations (in terms of ``I'' or ``O'') is less than x, then reduced dynamics\nof x is available. Otherwise, the residue class of x (namely, i module $2^t$)\ncan be partitioned into two halves (namely, i module $2^{t+1}$ and $i+2^t$\nmodule $2^{t+1}$), and either half presents ``I'' or ``O'' in intermediately\nforthcoming (t+1)-th computation. This discovery will be helpful to the final\nproof of Collatz conjecture - if the union of residue classes who present\nreduced dynamics that become larger with the growth of residue module, equals\nall positive integers asymptotically, then Reduced Collatz Conjecture (or\nequivalently, Collatz Conjecture) will be true.\n",

Since the goal is to define the real numbers, this can only\nmotivate the definition of which rules should be considered a real number. The\nrule must satisfy five properties and any rule that does so we call an oracle.\nThree of the properties ensure that we do not have multiple oracles\nrepresenting the same real number. The other two properties ensure that the\noracle does narrow down to a single real number. The most important property is\nthe Separating property which ensures that if we divide a Yes interval into two\nparts, then one part is a Yes interval while the other is a No interval; the\nexception is if the division point, which is a rational number, happens to be\nthe desired real number in which case both intervals are Yes intervals. We\nexplore various examples and algorithms in using oracles in addition to\nestablishing that the oracles do, in fact, form the field of real numbers. The\nconcept of a Family of Overlapping, Notionally Shrinking Intervals is defined\nand found to be an essential tool in working with oracle arithmetic. Mediant\napproximations, which are related to continued fraction representations,\nnaturally arise from an oracle perspective. We also compare and contrast with\nother common definitions of real numbers, such as Cauchy sequences and Dedekind\ncuts, in which the conclusion is that the oracle perspective is somewhat of a\nmaster map to the other definitions.

Equivalently, an\noperator ${\\cal{D}}$ with coefficients in a differential field $K$ can be\nparametrized by an operator ${\\cal{D}}_{-1}$ iff the differential module $M$\ndefined by ${\\cal{D}}$ is torsion-free, that is $t(M)={ext}^1_D(N,D) = 0$ when\n$N$ is the differential module defined by $ad( {\\cal{D}})$ and $D$ is the ring\nof differential operators with coefficients in $K$. Also $R = hom_K(M,K)$ is a\ndifferential module for the Spencer operator $d:R \\rightarrow T^* \\otimes R$,\nfirst introduced by Macaulay in 1916 with {\\it inverse systems}. When\n${\\cal{D}}$ is the self-adjoint Einstein operator, it is not evident that\n$t(M)\\neq 0$ is generated by the Weyl tensor having only to do with the group\nof conformal transformations. Gravitational waves are not coherent with these\nresults because the stress-functions parametrizing the Cauchy = ad (Killing)\noperator have nothing to do with the metric, {\\it exactly like the Airy or\nMaxwell functions in elasticity}. Similarly, the Cauchy operator has nothing to\ndo with any contraction of the Bianchi operator.\n",

A number of Collatz graphs have been\npresented to visualize the Collatz sequences. The Collatz graph is grown by\nconsidering the bottom-up method with the inverse relation. If n is the Collatz\nfunctional value of m, then n is connected by m. The concept is simple, the\ntree-based graphs indeed provide a path starting from n down to the root, the\nnumber of 1, for a given seed n, and demonstrate the generated Collatz\nsequences eventually converges to 1. However, as a general case, due to the\nirregular structures, no one has yet proved the completeness of the Collatz\ngraphs. By completeness we mean that the Collatz graph contains all positive\nintegers n. This paper proves the Collatz conjecture by constructing a Collatz\ngraph with the regular structure. The developed Collatz graph consists of\nCollatz nodes located various levels of the graph. In the developed graph, each\nnode consists of all positive integers m which have the functional value n. A\nset of simple, yet efficient connection rules is also developed to construct\nthe graph. Results show that the developed Collatz graph generates the Collatz\ntrajectories for all positive integers and the sequences converge to 1.

Zeno argued that Achilles could never overtake the\ntortoise, as at each step Achilles arrived at the tortoise's former position,\nthe tortoise had already moved ahead. Though Zeno's premise is valid, his\nconclusion that Achilles can \"never\" pass the tortoise relies on equating\ninfinite steps with an infinite amount of time. By modeling the sequence of\nevents in terms of a converging geometric series, this paper shows that such an\ninfinite number of events sum up to a finite distance traversed in finite time.\nThe paradox stems from confusion between an infinite number of events, which\ncan happen in a finite time interval, and an infinite amount of time. The\nfallacy is clarified by recognizing that the infinite number of events can be\ncrammed into a finite time interval. At a given speed difference after a finite\namount of time, Achilles will have completed the infinite series of gaps at the\n\"catch-up time\" and passed the tortoise. Hence this paradox of Achilles and the\ntortoise can be resolved by simply adding \"before the catch-up time\" to the\nconcluding statement of \"Achilles would never overtake the tortoise\".\n",

        "summary": "  The theory of fuzzy semigroups is a branch of mathematics that arose in early\n90's as an effort to characterize properties of semigroups by the properties of\ntheir fuzzy subsystems which include, fuzzy subsemigroups and their alike,\nfuzzy one (resp. two) sided ideals, fuzzy quasi-ideals, fuzzy bi-ideals etc. To\nbe more precise, a fuzzy subsemigroup of a given semigroup $(S,\\cdot)$ is just\na $\\wedge$-prehomomorphism $f$ of $(S,\\cdot)$ to $([0,1],\\wedge)$. Variations\nof this, which correspond to the other before mentioned fuzzy subsystems, can\nbe obtained by imposing certain properties to $f$. It turns out from the work\nof Kuroki, Mordeson, Malik and that of many of their descendants, that fuzzy\nsubsystems play a similar role to the structure theory of semigroups that play\ntheir non fuzzy analogues. The aim of the present paper is to show that this\nsimilarity is not coincidental. As a first step to this, we prove that there is\na 1-1 correspondence between fuzzy subsemigroups of $S$ and subsemigroups of a\ncertain type of $S\\times I$. Restricted to fuzzy one sided ideals, this\ncorrespondence identifies the above fuzzy subsystems to their analogues of\n$S\\times I$. Using these identifications, we prove that the characterization of\nthe regularity of semigroups in terms of fuzzy one sided ideals and fuzzy\nquasi-ideals can be obtained as an implication of the corresponding non fuzzy\nanalogue.\n",

More clearly, when we take the above set as finite or a set whose\naccumulation points is empty, we prove that the limit concept does not change.\nHowever, when we take the above set as countable or a set of measure zero, we\nprove that they are new limit concepts. Also, we show that these new limit\nconcepts have the properties of existence, uniqueness, additivity,\nmultiplicativity, etc. Finally, by giving some examples, we compare the limit\nconcepts we have obtained with the previous ones.\n",

For analytical reductions of\nintegrals arising from any of the three, however, there is the possible\ndrawback for large M of there being fewer tabled integrals over $[0,1]$ than\nover $[0,\\infty]$. These representations have integration variables within\nsquare roots as arguments of Macdonald functions.

Our analysis focuses on examining\nthe iteration sequence (or composition) of the Collatz function and its reduced\nvariant, which serves as an analog to the inverse function, to scrutinize the\nvalidity of the Collatz conjecture. To substantiate this conjecture, we\nincorporate binary strings into an algebraic formula that captures the essence\nof the Collatz sequence. By this means, we transform discrete powers of 2 into\ncontinuous counterparts, ultimately culminating in the smallest natural number,\n1. Consequently, the sequence generated through infinite iterations of the\nCollatz function emerges as an eventually periodic sequence, thereby validating\nan enduring 87-year-old conjecture.\n",

His paper included a theorem, known as Theorem 6.1.1 (denoted here as\nLemma 2.1 because of its simplicity and location in this paper), but doesn't\nstudy it much. Another paper by Mueller and Schleicher also analyzed this\nformula, but doesn't integrate or differentiate the formula and states some\nspecific applications. This paper will analyze the simple formula that\ngeneralizes sigma notation to non-integer upper and lower bounds. We state and\nprove this formula in Section 2. Section 3 states a few algebraic properties\nfor the sum and product formulae and shows how differentiation of sums and\nproducts works. Because integrating a product is challenging, we only analyze\nthe integration of sums in the fourth part of Section 3. In Section 4 we apply\nthe formula in the second section to create analytic continuations for\nfunctions defined as partial sums, formulate an infinite series representation\nto any limit, create a great approximation for functions that approach a\ncertain limit, make an analytic continuation for products, and calculate the\nsum of anti-derivatives. We then conclude with a discussion of the material of\nthis paper.\n",

Using Bernstein polynomials in the iterated function system, the\npaper initially proposes the numerical integration formula for the data set\ncorresponding to univariate functions. The proposed formula of integration is\nshown to be convergent by examining the data sets of certain weierstrass\nfunctions.\n  The paper then extends the Bernstein fractal approximation and numerical\nintegration technique to two dimensional interpolating regions. Bernstein\npolynomials defined over triangular domain has been used for the purpose. The\ntriangular domain has been partitioned and the newly generated points are\nassigned colors in a particular manner to maintain the chromatic number as 3.\nFollowing the above mentioned construction and approximation of bivariate\nBernstein fractal interpolation functions, the paper introduces the numerical\ndouble integration formula using the constructed functions. The convergence of\nthe double integration formula towards the actual integral value of the data\nsets is displayed with the help of some examples including the benchmark\nfunctions. Both the newly introduced iterated function systems are verified for\ntheir hyperbolicity and the resultant fractal interpolation functions are shown\nto be continuous.\n",

As a\ndirect consequence of this determination, we can assert that every zero of both\n{\\xi}(s)^2 and {\\xi}(s) has a real part equal to 1/2.

This extension enables the\nformulation of the most typical possible world in Relational Probabilistic\nLogic with symmetric relational symbols in terms of entropy maximization\nsubjected to constraints of quantum sub-hypergraph densities. The second\ncontribution is to prove the most typical constrained multi-relational\nhyper-graphons (the most typical possible worlds) are computable by proving the\nsolutions of the maximum entropy subjected by quantum sub-hypergraph densities\nin the space of multi-relational hyper-graphons are step functions except for\nin a zero measure set of combinations of quantum hyper-graphs densities with\nmultiple relations.

Using the non-normalized Lorenz curve, we apply a generalized form of\nthe classical majorization partial order. Next, we introduce a new class of\nsmall worlds, namely those based on degree centralities of networks. Similar to\na previous study, small worlds are defined as sequences of networks with\ncertain limiting properties. We distinguish between three types of small\nworlds: those based on the highest degree, those based on the average degree,\nand those based on the median degree. We show that these new classes of small\nworlds are different from those introduced previously based on the diameter of\nthe network or the average and median distance between nodes. However, there\nexist sequences of networks that qualify as small worlds in both senses of the\nword, with stars being an example. Our approach enables the comparison of two\nnetworks with an equal number of nodes in terms of their small-worldliness.\nFinally, we introduced neighboring arrays based on the degrees of the zeroth\nand first-order neighbors and proved that for trees, equal neighboring arrays\nlead to equal delta-arrays.\n",

They\ndiffered in their methodological approaches, with Cantor's prevailing. This led\nto the foundation of the theory of sets as well as Cantor's transfinite\narithmetic. This paper argues that Bolzano's conjecture is correct and that\nEuclid's principle, 'that the whole is greater than a part', should be\nconsidered as a necessary condition for the quantification of infinite sets\n(rather than bijection). Cantor had concluded that the rational and the\nalgebraic numbers were of the same size as the natural numbers, whilst, in\ncontrast, the real numbers were a larger set. Using Cantor's methods it is\nshown in this paper that the rational numbers are of larger size than the\nnatural numbers, thus showing that bijection is not a reliable measure of the\nsize of infinite sets. It is also concluded, using mathematical induction, that\ndifferent 'countably' infinite sets can have various different sizes. The\nimplications for theorems using bijection as a measure of size is then briefly\ndiscussed. There already exist new methods of measuring numerosity, based on\nEuclid's principle, which may develop a consistent system of infinite\narithmetic.\n",

One of these two monotone\nsequences act as the majorant of the original sequence, while the other\npossesses non-negativity. Another result establishes that an approximately\nmonotone(increasing) sequence can be closely approximated by a non-decreasing\nsequence. A similar assertion can be made for approximately convex sequence. A\nsequence $\\big<u_n\\big>_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ is said to be approximately convex (or\n$\\varepsilon$-convex) if the following inequality holds under the mentioned\nassumptions \\begin{equation*} u_{i}- u_{i-1}\\leq\nu_{j}-u_{j-1}+\\varepsilon\\quad\\quad\\mbox{ where}\\quad\\quad i,j\\in\\mathbb{N}\n\\quad \\mbox{with} \\quad i<j. \\end{equation*} We proved that an approximately\nconvex sequence can be written as the algebraic difference of two specific\ntypes of sequences.

The observed biases are the combination\nof two phenomena: (a) very small gaps, say $2 \\le g \\le 30$, get off to quick\nstarts and over the first 100 million primes larger gaps are too early in their\nevolution; and (b) the assignment of small gaps across the residue classes\ndisadvantages some of those classes - until enormous primes, far beyond the\ncomputational range.\n  For modulus 10 and a few other bases, we aggregate the gaps by residue class\nand track the evolution of these teams as Eratosthenes sieve continues. The\nrelative populations across these teams start with biases across the residue\nclasses. These initial biases fade as the sieve continues.

The \\( A \\)-philosophy advocates that studying the discriminant\nhypersurface forming within such parameter spaces, often reveals essential\ninsights about the original mathematical object and its zeros. In this paper we\napply the $A$-philosophy to our space $\\mathcal{Z}_N$ by introducing \\(\n\\Delta_n(\\overline{a} ) \\) the $n$-th Gram discriminant of \\( Z(t) \\). We show\nthat the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to the corrected Gram's law \\[\n(-1)^n \\Delta_n(\\overline{1}) > 0, \\] for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We further\nshow that the classical Gram's law \\( (-1)^n Z(g_n) >0\\) can be considered as a\nfirst-order approximation of our corrected law. The second-order approximation\nof $\\Delta_n (\\overline{a})$ is then shown to be related to shifts of Gram\npoints along the \\( t \\)-axis.

In\nparticular, we show that so-called indecomposable past sets in a spacetime can\nbe viewed as the points of the locale of futures. This builds towards a\npoint-free causal boundary construction.

We analyze the theoretical properties and statistical\nbehavior of Manhattan distance through mathematical derivations and\ncomputational simulations using Python.

A tricky polynomial fit is\nintroduced (six coefficients are involved like in the original Cantor\npolynomials with rigorous but simple restrictions on points chosen) to buy out\nthe regular treatment of math series to find the pairing polynomials instantly.\nThe original bijective Cantor polynomial C1(x,y)= (x2+2xy+y2+3x+y)/2: N02 to N0\n(=positive integers) which is 2-fold and runs in zig - zag way along lines\nx+y=N is extended e.g. to the bijective P(x,y)=\n2x2+4sgn(x)sgn(y)xy+2y2-2H(x)sgn(y)x-y+1: Z2 to N0 (with sign and Heaviside\nfunctions, Z is integers) running in spiral way along concentric rhombuses, or\nto the bijective P3D(x,y,z)= [x3+y3+z3 +3(xz2+yz2 +zx2+2xyz +zy2+yx2+xy2)\n+3(2x2+2y2 +z2+2xz +2yz+4xy) +5x+11y+2z]/6: N03 to N0 which is 6-fold and runs\nalong plains x+y+z=N. Storage device for triangle matrices is also commented as\ncutting the original Cantor domain to half along with related Diophantine\nequations.\n",

One of such applications is the\ncryptanalysis of RSA numbers, which requires prime factorization of large\nsemiprimes. Based on numerical experiments, this paper proposes a conjecture on\nthe distribution of digits on prime of infinite length. This paper infuses the\ntheoretical understanding of primes to optimize the search space of prime\nfactors by shrinking it upto 98.15%, which, in terms of application, has shown\n26.50% increase in the success rate and 41.91% decrease of the maximum number\nof generations required by the genetic algorithm used traditionally in the\nliterature. This paper also introduces a variation of the genetic algorithm\nnamed Sieve Method that is fine-tuned for factorization of big semi-primes,\nwhich was able to factor numbers up to 23 decimal digits with 84% success rate.\nOur findings shows that sieve methods on average has achieved 321.89% increase\nin success rate and 64.06% decrement in the maximum number of generations\nrequired for the algorithm to converge compared to the existing literatures.\n",

Several\nresearchers have extended the framework by combining it with other theories of\nuncertainty, such as fuzzy set theory, intuitionistic fuzzy soft set theory,\nrough soft set theory, and so on. These enhancements aim to increase the\napplicability and expressiveness of soft set theory, making it a more robust\ntool for dealing with complex, real-world problems characterized by uncertainty\nand vagueness. The notion of fuzzy soft sets and their associated operations\nwere introduced by Maji et al. \\cite{7}. However, Molodtsov \\cite{3} identified\nnumerous incorrect results and notions of soft set theory that were introduced\nin the paper \\cite{7}. Therefore, the derived concept of fuzzy soft sets is\nequally incorrect since the basic idea of soft sets in \\cite{7} is flawed.\nConsequently, it is essential to address these incorrect notions and provide an\nexact and formal definition of the idea of fuzzy soft sets. This reevaluation\nis important to guarantee fuzzy soft set theory's theoretical stability and\npractical application across a range of domains. In this paper, we propose\nfuzzy soft set theory based on Molodtsov's correct notion of soft set theory\nand demonstrate a fuzzy soft set in matrix form.

Towards the end of the paper,\nwe present a generalized method applicable to second-order recurrence\nrelations.\n  Our exploration of the Fibonacci--Theodorus spiral aims to address a variety\nof questions, showcasing its unique properties and behaviors. For example, we\nstudy topics such as area, perimeter, and angles. Notably, we establish a\nrelationship between the ratio of two consecutive areas and the golden ratio, a\npattern that extends to angles sharing a common vertex. Furthermore, we present\nsome asymptotic results. For instance, we demonstrate that the sum of the first\n$n$ areas comprising the spiral approaches a multiple of the sum of the initial\n$n$ Fibonacci numbers. Moreover, we provide a sequence of open problems related\nto all spiral worked in this paper.\n  Finally, in his work Hahn, Hahn observed a potential connection between the\ngolden ratio and the ratio of areas between spines of lengths $\\sqrt{F_{n+1}}$\nand $\\sqrt{F_{n+2}-1}$ and the areas between spines of lengths $\\sqrt{F_{n}}$\nand $\\sqrt{F_{n+1}-1}$ in the Theodorus spiral.

The second main result of the paper is to study the log-convexity and\nlog-concavity of the function $$h_p(x)=(1-x)^p{\\cal K}(\\sqrt x).$$ We prove\nthat $h_p$ is strictly log-concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $p\\geq 7/32$ and\nstrictly log-convex if and only if $p\\leq 0$. This solves some problems posed\nby Yang and Tian and complete their result and a result of Alzer and Richards\nthat $f_a$ is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $a=4/3$ and $1/f_a$ is\nstrictly concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $a\\geq 8/5$. As applications of the\nconvexity and concavity, we establish among other inequalities, that for $a\\geq\na_c$ and all $r\\in(0,1)$ $$\\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt\\pi}{(2a+\\log 2)\\Gamma(3/4)^2}\\leq\n\\frac{{\\cal K}(\\sqrt r)}{a-\\frac12\\log (r)}+\\frac{{\\cal\nK}(\\sqrt{1-r})}{a-\\frac12\\log (1-r)}<1+\\frac\\pi{2a},$$ and for $p\\geq 3(2+\\sqrt\n2)/8$ and all $r\\in(0,1)$ $$\\sqrt{(r-r^2)^p{\\cal K}(\\sqrt{1-r}){\\cal K}(\\sqrt\nr)}< \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt\\pi}{2^{p+1}\\Gamma(3/4)^2}<\\frac{r^p{\\cal\nK}(\\sqrt{1-r})+(1-r)^p{\\cal K}(\\sqrt r)}{2}.$$\n",

This paper develops the notion of a\ndynamical system of IFS to study how an initial IFS evolves over time. We\nconstruct a complete metric space consisting of countable IFS as the state\nspace. An evolution operator is defined that maps the state space across time\nwhile satisfying properties of a dynamical system. We analyze the resulting IFS\ndynamics, introducing concepts like the IFS shift map and parity evolution\noperators. The shift map is proven continuous and its periodic points\ncharacterized. Results relate properties of parity evolution operators to\nsimilarity dimensions of the resulting IFS. Overall, this dynamical system\nframework allows rigorous analysis of IFS behavior over time. By providing\ntools to model fractal progression, it has significant applications in areas\nincluding image analysis, biology, and physics. The dynamics and properties\nestablished lay groundwork for future studies and practical models leveraging\nIFS.\n",

In\nthis work, we explore the behavior of the $A B C$ index for tree graphs. We\nestablish both lower and upper bounds for the $A B C$ index, expressed in terms\nof the graph's order and its Roman domination number. Additionally, we\ncharacterize the tree structures that correspond to these extremal values,\noffering a deeper understanding of how the Roman domination number ($RDN$)\ninfluences the $A B C$ index in tree graphs.\n",

In an\nodor-mediated systems, the sense of smell or odour of species plays a critical\nrole in the interactions between predators and prey. It is widely recognised in\nscientific literature that these systems are very common and essential across\nnatural ecosystems. These systems are crucial for various behaviors, including\nforaging, mating, and avoiding predators. In this paper, it is assumed that the\npresence of prey odour aids the predator in its hunting efforts. It is assumed\nthat both prey and intermediate predators seek refuge against their respective\npredators upon detecting the odour of their predators. In other words, the\nodour of predators assists prey species in evaluating the danger and seeking\nrefuge for hiding. This model incorporates the prey species' harvesting as\nwell. We also explore the impact of fading memory on the system by\nincorporating fractional derivatives into the model. The conditions for both\nthe existence and local stability of the non-negative equilibria are derived.\nThe current model system undergoes both Hopf and transcritical bifurcation when\nthe parameter values are appropriately chosen. The dynamic behaviour of the\nsystem is showcased and thoroughly analysed using a range of diagrams,\nhighlighting the the impact of prey refuge and predator odour parameters. This\npaper extensively examines the long-term impacts of harvesting within the\nsystem. The presence of prey odour plays a significant role in promoting a\nlong-term cohabitation dynamic within this specific system. It has been\nobserved that when individuals within the system have a strong memory, it\npositively affects the stability of the system. Numerical simulations are\nconducted in order to demonstrate and validate the usefulness of the model\nbeing considered, therefore supporting the analytical conclusions.\n",

Over time, fuzzy soft set theory has emerged as a\nsignificant extension, blending the principles of fuzzy set theory and soft set\ntheory to support applications in various decision-making processes. This study\nrevisits fuzzy soft set theory, addressing conceptual errors and inaccuracies\nin the definitions of t-norm, t-conorm, strong negation, and implication that\ndeviated from Molodtsov's foundational principles. Corrected definitions-fuzzy\nsoft t-norm, fuzzy soft t-conorm, fuzzy soft negation, and fuzzy soft\nimplication-are proposed to ensure theoretical rigor.

Traditional clutter\ncovariance matrix (CCM) estimation relies on Euclidean metrics, which fail to\ncapture the intrinsic geometric and structural properties of the covariance\nmatrix, thus limiting the utilization of structural information in the data. To\naddress these issues, the proposed algorithm begins by constructing Toeplitz\nHermitian positive definite (THPD) matrices from the training samples. The\nBrauer disc (BD) theorem is then employed to filter out THPD matrices\ncontaining target signals, retaining only clutter-related matrices. These\nclutter matrices undergo eigendecomposition to construct the Grassmann\nmanifold, enabling CCM estimation through the volume cross-correlation function\n(VCF) and gradient descent method. Finally, the filter weight vector is\ncomputed for filtering. By fully leveraging the structural information in radar\ndata, this approach significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness of\nclutter suppression. Experimental results on simulated and measured data\ndemonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm in heterogeneous\nenvironments.\n",

Therefore, D is also isomorphic to the\ncongruence lattice of a sectionally complemented modular lattice L, namely, the\nprincipal right ideal lattice of R. Furthermore, if the largest element of D is\ncompact, then one can assume that R is unital, respectively, that L has a\nlargest element. This extends several known results of G.M. Bergman, A.P.

Some examples include\ncorrecting the trajectory of rocket and air vehicles, vibration suppression of\nflexible structures, and airplane stability. In all these cases, the focus is\nin suppressing/decreasing system deviations rapidly. However, if one compares\nthe Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution with optimal solutions (minimum\ntime), it is seen that the LQR solution is less than optimal in some cases\nindeed (3-6) times that obtained using a minimum time solution. Moreover, the\nLQR solution is sometimes unacceptable in practice due to the fact that values\nof control extend beyond admissible limits and thus the designer must choose\ncoefficients in the linear quadratic form, which are unknown.\n  The authors suggest methods which allow finding a quasi-optimal LQR solution\nwith bounded control which is closed to the minimum time solution.

It is known that for every real n x n matrix, A,\nif no real eigenvalue of A is negative or zero, then A has a real logarithm,\nthat is, there is a real matrix, X, such that e^X = A. Furthermore, if the\neigenvalues, xi, of X satisfy the property -pi < Im(xi) < pi, then X is unique.\nIt is also known that under the same condition every real n x n matrix, A, has\na real square root, that is, there is a real matrix, X, such that X^2 = A.\nMoreover, if the eigenvalues, rho e^{i theta}, of X satisfy the condition -pi/2\n< theta < pi/2, then X is unique. These theorems are the theoretical basis for\nvarious numerical methods for exponentiating a matrix or for computing its\nlogarithm using a method known as scaling and squaring (resp. inverse scaling\nand squaring). Such methods play an important role in the log-Euclidean\nframework due to Arsigny, Fillard, Pennec and Ayache and its applications to\nmedical imaging. Actually, there is a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nreal matrix to have a real logarithm (or a real square root) but it is fairly\nsubtle as it involves the parity of the number of Jordan blocks associated with\nnegative eigenvalues. As far as I know, with the exception of Higham's recent\nbook, proofs of these results are scattered in the literature and it is not\neasy to locate them. Moreover, Higham's excellent book assumes a certain level\nof background in linear algebra that readers interested in the topics of this\npaper may not possess so we feel that a more elementary presentation might be a\nvaluable supplement to Higham. In these notes, I present a unified exposition\nof these results and give more direct proofs of some of them using the Real\nJordan Form.\n",

In this picture probability is a bi-valuation\ndefined on a lattice of statements that quantifies the degree to which one\nstatement implies another. The sum rule is a constraint equation that ensures\nthat valuations are assigned so as to not violate associativity of the lattice\njoin and meet. The product rule is much more interesting in that there are\nactually two product rules: one is a constraint equation arises from\nassociativity of the direct products of lattices, and the other a constraint\nequation derived from associativity of changes of context. The generality of\nthis formalism enables one to derive the traditionally assumed condition of\nadditivity in measure theory, as well introduce a general notion of product.

The truth value of a logical formula subject to a set\nof axioms is computed from the solution to the corresponding system of\npolynomial equations. A reference by a formula to its own provability is shown\nto be a recurrence relation, which can be either interpreted as such to\ngenerate a discrete dynamical system, or interpreted in a static way to create\nan additional simultaneous equation. In this framework the truth values of\nlogical formulas and other polynomial objectives have complex data structures:\nsets of elementary values, or dynamical systems that generate sets of infinite\nsequences of such solution-value sets. Besides the routine result that a\nformula has a definite elementary value, these data structures encode several\nexceptions: formulas that are ambiguous, unsatisfiable, unsteady, or\ncontingent. These exceptions represent several semantically different types of\nundecidability; none causes any fundamental problem for mathematics. It is\nsimple to calculate that Goedel's formula, which asserts that it cannot be\nproven, is exceptional in specific ways: interpreted statically, the formula\ndefines an inconsistent system of equations (thus it is called unsatisfiable);\ninterpreted dynamically, it defines a dynamical system that has a periodic\norbit and no fixed point (thus it is called unsteady). These exceptions are not\ncatastrophic failures of logic; they are accurate mathematical descriptions of\nGoedel's self-referential construction.

        "summary": "  Maximal planar graph refers to the planar graph with the most edges, which\nmeans no more edges can be added so that the resulting graph is still planar.\nThe Four-Color Conjecture says that every planar graph without loops is\n4-colorable. Indeed, in order to prove Four-Color Conjecture, it clearly\nsuffices to show that all maximal planar graphs are 4-colorable. Since this\nconjecture was proposed in 1852, no mathematical proofs have been invented up\nuntil now. Maybe the main reasons lie in the following three aspects in terms\nof maximal planar graphs: not clearing up the structures, not figuring out the\ncoloring types, and not straightening out the relation between structure and\ncoloring. For this, we will write a series of articles to study the structure\nand coloring theory of maximal planar graphs systematically. This is our first\narticle, which focuses mainly on the structure and coloring relations. First,\nwe introduce a new way to construct maximal planar graphs. The advantage of\nthis method is that it establishes an immediate relation with 4-colorings, and\nreveals how a given maximal planar graph is generated. Second, a special class\nof maximal planar graphs--recursive maximal planar graphs is researched in\ndepth, which lays a foundation for solving the uniquely 4-colorable planar\ngraphs conjecture(see subsequent articles). Third, we discover an important\nmode for classifying 4-colorings: tree-coloring and cycle-coloring, which runs\nthrough the whole series of articles. Furthermore, this mode is applied to the\nresearch on an arbitrary 4-coloring and its corresponding structure of unions\nof two and three bicolored subgraphs. Finally, we introduce the concepts of\nblack-white coloring and stamen phenomenon, and find out a necessary and\nsufficient condition for an even cycle to be a 2-colorable cycle.\n",

By computing Lyapunov exponents, we demonstrate that\nthe derived dynamics exhibit chaotic behavior when the gaps between zeros are\nwithin a certain bound, specifically up to 2.4. Beyond this threshold, the\ndynamics do not display chaotic behavior. Furthermore, we derive a chaotic\noperator for the Riemann zeta function within the critical strip, utilizing the\ncorrection term from the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula. We establish the chaotic\nnature and Hermiticity of this operator, and discuss its diagonalization\nproperties. Moreover, our study reveals a remarkable compatibility between our\nderived chaotic operator and the quantum hydrogen model, as evidenced by the\nanalysis of its eigenvalues resembling the energy levels of hydrogen. Numerical\nevidence, including Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation analysis, and entropy\ncomputation, underscores the unpredictability of the system. Additionally, we\nestablish a connection between our chaotic operator and the prime number\ntheorem regarding the density of primes.

It involves analyzing objects of geometry and\nanalysis using nonlocal methods, as opposed to the classical local methods,\ne.g., Newton's calculus. It also involves analyzing new nonlocal geometries and\nnonlocal analytical objects, i.e. nonlocal fields. In geometry, we introduce\nand study (nonlocal) forms, differentials, integrals, connections, curvatures,\nholonomy, G-structures, etc. In analysis, we analyze local fields using\nnonlocal methods (semilocal analysis); nonlocal fields nonlocally (of course);\nand the connection between nonlocal linear analysis and local nonlinear\nanalysis. Analysis and geometry are next synthesized to yield nonlocal (hence\nnoncommutative) homology, cohomology, de Rham theory, Hodge theory, Chern-Weil\ntheory, K-theory (called N-theory) and index theory.

The ICMAUS concepts and a computer model in which they are embodied\nare briefly described.\n  The first of the two main sections describes how many of the commonly-used\nforms and structures in mathematics, logic and related disciplines (such as\ntheoretical linguistics and computer programming) may be seen as devices for\nIC. In some cases, these forms and structures may be interpreted in terms of\nthe ICMAUS framework.\n  The second main section describes a selection of examples where processes of\ncalculation and inference in mathematics, logic and related disciplines may be\nunderstood as IC. In many cases, these examples may be understood more\nspecifically in terms of the ICMAUS concepts.\n",

Particular examples of espaliers\ninclude (i) complete Boolean algebras, (ii) direct summand lattices of\nnonsingular injective modules, (iii) complete, meet-continuous, complemented,\nmodular lattices, and (iv) projection lattices in AW*-algebras.

One novel variational principle is established instead of\nPontryagin maximum principle or other extremal principles to be suitable for\nall types of critical points in nonlinear LC circuits. The generalized\nEuler-Lagrange equation of new form is derived. The canonical Hamiltonian\nsystems of description are also obtained under the Legendre transformation,\ninstead of the generalized type of Hamiltonian systems. This approach is not\nonly very simple in theory but also convenient in applications and applicable\nfor nonlinear LC circuits with arbitrary topology and other additional integral\nconstraints.\n",
