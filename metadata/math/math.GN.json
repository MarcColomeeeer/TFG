A dense subgroup $D$ of $G$ determines $G$ if the (necessarily\ncontinuous) surjective isomorphism $\\hat{G} \\twoheadrightarrow \\hat{D}$ given\nby $h\\mapsto h|D$ is a homeomorphism, and $G$ is determined if each dense\nsubgroup of $G$ determines $G$. The principal result in this area, obtained\nindependently by L. Aussenhofer and M. J. Chasco}, is the following: Every\nmetrizable group is determined. The authors offer several related results,\nincluding these. (1) There are (many) nonmetrizable, noncompact, determined\ngroups. (2) If the dense subgroup $D_i$ determines $G_i$ with $G_i$ compact,\nthen $\\oplus_i D_i$ determines $\\Pi_i G_i$. In particular, if each $G_i$ is\ncompact then $\\oplus_i G_i$ determines $\\Pi_i G_i$. (3) Let $G$ be a locally\nbounded group and let $G^+$ denote $G$ with its Bohr topology. Then $G$ is\ndetermined if and only if ${G^+}$ is determined. (4) Let $non(N)$ be the least\ncardinal $\\kappa$ such that some $X \\subseteq T}$ of cardinality $\\kappa$ has\npositive outer measure. No compact $G$ with $w(G)\\geq non(N)$ is determined;\nthus if $non(N)=\\aleph_1$ (in particular if CH holds), an infinite compact\ngroup $G$ is determined if and only if w(G)=\\omega$. Question. Is there in ZFC\na cardinal $\\kappa$ such that a compact group $G$ is determined if and only if\n$w(G)<\\kappa$? Is $\\kappa=non(N)$? $\\kappa=\\aleph_1$?\n",

We\nare going to look at how these classes are related, and how well the various\nproperties behave under certain operations, such as taking subspaces, products,\nand images under proper mappings. Where they are not well behaved we take the\nopportunity to consider some relevant examples, which are often of special\ninterest. For instance, we examine an example of a Frechet space with unique\nsequential limits that is not Hausdorff. I asked the question of whether there\nexists in ZFC an example of a perfectly normal space that does not have\ncountable tightness: such an example was supplied and appears below.

This answers a question of Matveev,\nand improves a result of Buzyakova, who proved the same result for X compact.\n  We also prove that if a space X is the union of finitely many D-spaces, and\nhas countable extent, then X is linearly Lindel\\\"of. It follows that if X is in\naddition countably compact, then X must be compact. We also show that Corson\ncompact spaces are hereditarily D-spaces. These last two results answer recent\nquestions of Arhangel'skii. Finally, we answer a question of van Douwen by\nshowing that a perfectly normal collectionwise-normal non-paracompact space\nconstructed by R. Pol is a D-space.\n",

We show that the\nperfect oriented maps of the plane coincide with confluent (that is composition\nof monotone and open) perfect maps of the plane.

More\ngenerally, it was suggested by Kronheimer and Mrowka that the Khovanov homology\nof any knot might be related via gauge theory to the space of all trace-free\nSU(2) representations. Our result suggests that when the knot is alternating,\nKhovanov homology only sees the trace-free representations which are binary\ndihedral. The proof we give is completely elementary, using the skein exact\nsequence, so it does not explain why Khovanov homology should have this\ntopological significance. In addition, we prove a conjecture of Shumakovitch\nthat the Khovanov homology of alternating knots and 2-component links contains\nno n-torsion for n > 2. We also point out a relationship between the grading in\nKhovanov homology and the Casson-Walker invariant of the branched double cover.\n",

Here |S1(p)| is the\narc length of the unit sphere of p and |S2(p)| is the arc length of the sphere\nof radius 2. This curvature 12 formula is discrete Gauss-Bonnet formula or Hopf\nUmlaufsatz. The curvature introduced here is motivated by analogue\nconstructions in the continuum like the Jacobi equations for geodesic flows.\nFor the first order curvature K1(p) = 6-|S1(p)|, Gauss-Bonnet results are much\neasier to show, are less \"differential geometric\" but generalize to rather\ngeneral 2-dimensional graphs G=(V,E): The sum of the K1 curvatures over the\nentire graph is 6 times the Euler characteristic of G, where the Euler\ncharacteristic is defined as v-e+f where v=|V|,e=|E| and f is the number of\ntriangles. For many abstract two dimensional graphs, the sum over all K\ncurvatures is 60 times the Euler characteristic. Under which conditions this\ncurvature 60 theorem holds is still under investigation.

These properties are much stronger\nthan separability, but are equivalent to it in the presence of certain\nconvergence properties. For example, we show that every Hausdorff separable\nradial space is R-separable and note that neither separable sequential nor\nseparable Whyburn spaces have to be selectively separable. A space is called\n\\emph{d-separable} if it has a dense $\\sigma$-discrete subspace. We call a\nspace $X$ D-separable if for every sequence of dense subspaces $(D_n :\nn\\in\\omega)$ one can pick discrete subsets $F_n\\subset D_n$ such that\n$\\bigcup_{n\\in\\omega}F_n$ is dense in $X$. Although $d$-separable spaces are\noften also $D$-separable (this is the case, for example, with linearly ordered\n$d$-separable or stratifiable spaces), we offer three examples of countable\nnon-$D$-separable spaces. It is known that d-separability is preserved by\narbitrary products, and that for every $X$, the power $X^{d(X)}$ is\nd-separable. We show that D-separability is not preserved even by finite\nproducts, and that for every infinite $X$, the power $X^{2^{d(X)}}$ is not\nD-separable. However, for every $X$ there is a $Y$ such that $X\\times Y$ is\nD-separable. Finally, we discuss selective and D-separability in the presence\nof maximality. For example, we show that (assuming ${\\mathfrak d}=\\mathfrak c$)\nthere exists a maximal regular countable selectively separable space, and that\n(in ZFC) every maximal countable space is D-separable (while some of those are\nnot selectively separable).

The concept of\n\"Cauchy-indivisibility\" follows a more general research direction proposal in\nwhich we investigate the impact of basic notions in substantial results, like\nthe impact of local compactness and connectivity in the theory of proper\ntransformation groups. In order to provide some basic theory for this new class\nof actions we embed a \"Cauchy-indivisible\" action of a group of isometries of a\nseparable metric space in a proper action of a semigroup in the completion of\nthe underlying space.

In the present\nwork, starting from Grandis's notion of directed space, we propose an\nadditional condition of saturation for distinguished sets of paths and show how\nit allows to rule out exotic examples without any serious collateral damage.\nOur saturation condition is local in a natural sense, and is satisfied by the\ndirected interval (and the directed circle). Furthermore we show in which sense\nit is the strongest condition fulfilling these two basic requirements. Our\nsaturation condition selects a full, reflective subcategory of Grandis's\ncategory of d-spaces, which is closed under arbitrary limits of d-spaces, has\narbitrary colimits (obtained by saturating the corresponding colimits of\nd-spaces), and has nice cylinder and cocylinder constructions.

This is generally\ninterpreted as the price to be paid for the numerous services provided by this\naxiom. The theory proposed by Olivier Leroy shows that we can have\nsimultaneously axiom of choice and \" everything is measurable \" it takes place\nwithin the framework of \"locales\" which are particular cases of Grothendieck's\ntoposes : a \"locale\" is just a poset which has the formal properties of the\nposet of open subsets of a topological space. \"Locales\" have already been the\nobject of numerous studies (cf for example \"Sheaves in Geometry and Logic\" of\nS.Mac Lane and I.Moerdijk. Springer 92.). One of the remarkable aspects of this\ntheory is that it applies in a relevant way to the usual topological spaces in\nwhich it shows up \" non standard sub-spaces \" (sub-locales)); with for\nconsequence that the intersection (in the meaning of locale) of ordinary\nsub-spaces is not anymore necessarily a (ordinary) sub-space. We have for\nexample a sub-locale of R (called generic sub-locale of R) which is the\nintersection of dense open sets and which is still dense (although pointless).\nThe most striking result is doubtless that the natural continuation of the\nmeasure of Lebesgue (on [0,1] for example) on the open sets to the totality of\nsub-locales of [0,1] is a sigma additive outside regular measure The\n\"paradoxical \" partitions which gave non-measurable subsets in the classical\ncontext are no more partitions in the context of locales.

In the traditional presentation of these concepts there is a\nsubstantial difference between connectedness and the other two notions, namely\nconnectedness is defined as the absence of disconnectedness, while path\nconnectedness and uniform connectedness are defined in terms of connecting\npaths and connecting chains, respectively. In compact metric spaces uniform\nconnectedness and connectedness are well-known to coincide, thus the apparent\nconceptual difference between the two notions disappears. Connectedness in\ntopological spaces can also be defined in terms of chains governed by open\ncoverings in a manner that is more reminiscent of path connectedness. We\npresent a unifying metric formalism for connectedness, which encompasses both\nconnectedness of topological spaces and uniform connectedness of uniform\nspaces, and which further extends to a hierarchy of notions of connectedness.\n",

        "summary": "  A subspace Y of a separable metrizable space X is separable, but without X\nmetrizable this is not true even If Y is a closed linear subspace of a\ntopological vector space X. K.H. Hofmann and S.A. Morris introduced the class\nof pro-Lie groups which consists of projective limits of finite-dimensional Lie\ngroups and proved that it contains all compact groups, locally compact abelian\ngroups and connected locally compact groups and is closed under products and\nclosed subgroups. A topological group G is almost connected if the quotient\ngroup of G by the connected component of its identity is compact. We prove that\nan almost connected pro-Lie group is separable iff its weight is not greater\nthan c. It is deduced that an almost connected pro-Lie group is separable if\nand only if it is a subspace of a separable Hausdorff space. It is proved that\na locally compact (even feathered) topological group G which is a subgroup of a\nseparable Hausdorff topological group is separable, but the conclusion is false\nif it is assumed only that G is homeomorphic to a subspace of a separable\nTychonoff space. Every precompact topological group of weight less than or\nequal to c is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of a separable\npseudocompact group of weight c. This implies that there is a wealth of closed\nnonseparable subgroups of separable pseudocompact groups. An example is\npresented under CH of a separable countably compact abelian group which\ncontains a non-separable closed subgroup. It is proved that the following\nconditions are equivalent for an omega-narrow topological group G: (i) G is a\nsubspace of a separable regular space; (ii) G is a subgroup of a separable\ntopological group; (iii) G is a closed subgroup of a separable pathconnected\nlocally pathconnected group.\n",

We provide a sufficient condition on $X$\nunder which the topological group $H_+(X)$ is minimal. This condition is\nsatisfied, for example, by: the unit interval, the ordered square, the extended\nlong line and the circle (endowed with its cyclic order). In fact, these groups\nare even $a$-minimal, meaning, in this setting, that the compact-open topology\non $G$ is the smallest Hausdorff group topology on $G$. One of the key ideas is\nto verify that for such $X$ the Zariski and the Markov topologies on the group\n$H_+(X)$ coincide with the compact-open topology.

This fundamental theorem states: If we embed an $(n-1)$ sphere\n$S^{(n-1)}$ locally flatly in an $n$ sphere $S^{n}$, then it decomposes $S^{n}$\ninto two components. In addition, the embedded $S^{(n-1)}$ is the common\nboundary of the two components and each component is homeomorphic to the\n$n$-ball.\\newline This paper gives a constructive proof of the theorem using\nthe discrete method. More specifically, we prove the equivalent statements: Let\n$M$ be an $n$-manifold, which is homeomorphic to $S^{n}$. Then, every\n$(n-1)$-manifold $S$, a submanifold with local flatness in $M$, decomposes the\nspace $M$ into two components where each component is homeomorphic to an\n$n$-ball. The method was chosen in order to evaluate the computability and\ncomputational costs among operations between cells regarding homeomorphism. In\naddition, methods within the proof can be extended to applications in design\nalgorithms under the assumption that homeomorphic mappings are constructible\nand computable.

In this article we denote by\n$C_c^K(X)$ (resp., $C_{c}^{\\psi}(X)$) the set of all functions in $C_c(X)$ with\ncompact (resp., pseudocompact) support. First, we observe that\n$C_c^{K}(X)=O_c^{\\beta_0X\\setminus X}$ (resp.,\n$C_c^{\\psi}(X)=M_c^{\\beta_0X\\setminus \\upsilon_0X}$). This implies that for an\n$\\Bbb{N}$-compact space $X$, the intersection of all free maximal ideals in\n$C_c(X)$ equals to $C_c^K(X)$, i.e., $M_c^{\\beta_0X\\setminus X}=C_c^K(X)$.\nAfterwards, by applying methods of functionally countable subalgebras, we\nobserve some results in the remainder of Banaschewski compactification. It is\nshown that for a zero-dimensional non pseudocompact space $X$, the set\n$\\beta_0X\\setminus \\upsilon_0X$ has cardinality at least $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\nMoreover, for a locally compact and $\\Bbb{N}$-compact space $X$, the remainder\n$\\beta_0X\\setminus X$ is an almost $P$-space. These results leads us to find a\nclass of Parovi$\\breve{\\mbox{c}}$enko spaces in Banaschewski compactification\nos a non pseudocompact zero-dimensional space.

The aim of this article is to better understand the boundaries of this\nclass, by presenting new examples and counter-examples.

In this paper we shall prove that some classes of dcpos are\nSCL-faithful, these classes contain some dcpos whose Scott topologies are not\nbounded sober. These results will help to obtain a complete characterization of\nSCL-faithful dcpos in the future.\n",

Set description results from the use\nof probe functions to define feature vectors that describe a set and the\nnearness of sets is given by their proximities. A probe on a non-empty set $X$\nis a real-valued function $\\Phi: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$, where $\\Phi(x)=\n(\\phi_1(x),.., \\phi_n(x))$. We establish a connection between relations on an\nobject space $X$ and relations on the feature space $\\Phi(X).$ Having as\nstarting point the Peters proximity, two sets are \\emph{descriptively near}, if\nand only if their descriptions intersect. In this paper, we construct a\ntheoretical approach to a more visual form of proximity, namely, descriptive\nproximity, which has a broad spectrum of applications. We organize descriptive\nproximities on two different levels: weaker or stronger than the Peters\nproximity. We analyze the properties and interplay between descriptions on one\nside and classical proximities and overlap relations on the other side.\n",

As $|X|\\leq 2^{wL(X)\\chi(X)}$ for a normal space $X$ [3], this\nenlarges the class of known Tychonoff spaces for which this bound holds. In\n2.10 we give a short, direct proof of (1) that does not use 2.1.

As a consequence, we obtain some bounds for ${\\tt\nadd}(\\text{IQN-space})$. In particular, we get ${\\tt\nadd}(\\text{IQN-space})=\\mathfrak{b}$ for analytic P-ideals I generated by an\nunbounded submeasure.\n  By a result of Bukovsk\\'y, Das and \\v{S}upina it is known that in the case of\ntall ideals I the notions of IQN-space (IwQN-space) and QN-space (wQN-space)\ncannot be distinguished. We prove that if I is a tall ideal and X is a\ntopological space of cardinality less than ${\\tt cov^*}(I)$, then X is an\nIwQN-space if and only if it is a wQN-space.\n",

Contrary to the case of the one-point compactification, a\none-point connectification, if exists, may not be unique.

In order to study these\nproperties, the concept of $P$-spaces and extremally disconnected spaces are\nextend to topoframes. For a $P$- topoframe $L_{ \\tau}$, the ring\n$\\mathcal{R}L_\\tau$ is $\\aleph_0$-Kasch ring. $P$- topoframes are characterized\nin terms of ring-theoretic properties of the regularity and injectivity of the\nring of real-continuous functions on a topoframe. It follows from these\ncharacterizations that the ring $\\mathcal{R}L_\\tau$ is regular if and only if\nit is $\\aleph_0$-selfinjective. For a completely regular topoframe $L_\\tau$, we\nshow that $\\mathcal{R}L_\\tau$ is a Bear ring if and only if it is a $CS$-ring\nif and only if $L_\\tau$ is extremally disconnected and also prove that it is\nselfinjective ring if and only if $L_{ \\tau}$ is an extremally disconnected\n$P$-topoframe.\n",

We also develop a theory of representations of $\\mathcal\nF$-Borel sets, and show how to apply this theory to prove that the complexity\nof hereditarily Lindel\\\"of spaces is absolute (that is, it is the same in every\ncompactification). We use these representations to characterize the\ncomplexities attainable by a specific class of topological spaces. This\nprovides an alternative proof of the first result, and implies the existence of\na space with non-absolute additive complexity. We discuss the method used by\nTalagrand to construct the first example of a space with non-absolute\ncomplexity, hopefully providing an explanation which is more accessible than\nthe original one. We also discuss the relation of complexity and local\ncomplexity, and show how to construct amalgamation-like compactifications.\n",

This\ndocument can interest any student in Pure Mathematics in the topics of topology\nand category theory. The image-dense morphisms are clearly epimorphisms. To\netablish the converse, I use an analogous to the Kolmogorov quotient that I\ncall Hausdorff quotient. Thanks to this Hausdorff quotient, one can prove that\nthe Haus-category is a reflective subcategory of the category of topological\nspaces. As it is also a full subcategory, we deduce a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for a topological space to be Hausdorff. We use this condition to\nshow that if a morphism f:A->B is not image-dense, then the Hausdorff quotient\nof the quotient B/cl(f(A)) has at least two points.

First we\ngive an example of a non-sequential compactum $X$ such that\n$wt(X)=\\aleph_0<t(X)$ under $2^{\\aleph_0}=2^{\\aleph_1}$. In particular, this\ndemonstrates the celebrated Balogh's Theorem [5] does not hold in general if\ncountably tight is replaced with weakly countably tight. Second, we introduce\nthe notion of an S-free sequence and show that if $X$ is a homogeneous\ncompactum then $|X|\\leq 2^{wt(X)\\pi_\\chi(X)}$. This refines a theorem of De la\nVega [12].

As a\nsample of possible applications we discuss metric spaces, ultrametric spaces,\nordered groups and fields, topological spaces, partially ordered sets, and\nlattices. We describe several notions of completeness in these spaces and\nstructures and determine their respective strengths. In order to illustrate\nsome consequences of the levels of strength, we give examples of generic fixed\npoint theorems which then can be specialized to theorems in various\napplications which work with contracting functions and some completeness\nproperty of the underlying space.\n  Ball spaces are nonempty sets of nonempty subsets of a given set. They are\ncalled spherically complete if every chain of balls has a nonempty\nintersection. This is all that is needed for the encoding of completeness\nnotions. We discuss operations on the sets of balls to determine when they lead\nto larger sets of balls; if so, then the properties of the so obtained new ball\nspaces are determined. The operations can lead to increased level of strength,\nor to ball spaces of newly constructed structures, such as products. Further,\nthe general framework makes it possible to transfer concepts and approaches\nfrom one application to the other; as examples we discuss theorems analogous to\nthe Knaster--Tarski Fixed Point Theorem for lattices and theorems analogous to\nthe Tychonoff Theorem for topological spaces.\n",

This characterization suggests to call a topological space $super$\nif it has a binary closed $k$-network $\\mathcal N$. The binarity of $\\mathcal\nN$ means that every linked subfamily of $\\mathcal N$ is centered. Therefore, a\nHausdorff space is supercompact if and only if it is super and compact. In this\npaper we prove that the class of super spaces contains all GO-spaces, all\nsupercompact spaces, all metrizable spaces, and all collectionwise normal\n$\\aleph$-spaces. Moreover, the class of super spaces is closed under taking\nTychonoff products and discretely dense sets in Tychonoff products. The\nsuperness of metrizable spaces implies that each compact metrizable space is\nsupercompact, which was first proved by Strok and Szyma\\'nski (1975) and then\nreproved by Mills (1979), van Douwen (1981), and D{\\c e}bski (1984).\n",

The notions of feebly continuity and\nvery feebly continuity of $f$ at a point $\\langle x,y\\rangle\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$\nwere considered by I. Leader in 2009. We study properties of the sets $FC(f)$\n(respectively, $VFC(f)\\supset FC(f)$) of points at which $f$ is feebly\ncontinuous (very feebly continuous). We prove that $VFC(f)$ is densely\nnonmeager, and, if $f$ has the Baire property (is measurable), then $FC(f)$ is\nresidual (has full outer Lebesgue measure). We describe several examples of\nfunctions $f$ for which $FC(f)\\neq VFC(f)$. Then we consider the notion of\ntwo-feebly continuity which is strictly weaker than very feebly continuity. We\nprove that the set of points where (an arbitrary) $f$ is two-feebly continuous\nforms a residual set of full outer measure. Finally, we study the existence of\nlarge algebraic structures inside or outside various sets of feebly continuous\nfunctions.\n",

A simple calculation shows that Nachbin's observation amounts to the\nwell known fact that if a space $X$ is compact, then the projection map $Z\n\\times X \\to Z$ is closed for every space $Z$. It is also well known that the\nconverse holds: if a space $X$ has the property that the projection $Z \\times X\n\\to Z$ is closed for every space $Z$, then $X$ is compact.

The standard definition of a Valdivia compact spaces is via a\n$\\Sigma$-product of a power of the unit interval.

In \\cite{casa1}, the Corson compact\nspaces are characterized by a special family of closed subsets.

For\na separable metrizable space $X$, we identify a game-theoretic condition\nequivalent to $K(X)$ being hereditarily Baire.

Subsequently, we\nuse topological games to study hereditary Baire property in spaces of\nprobability measures and in hyperspaces over filters on natural numbers. To\nthis end, we introduce a notion of strong $P$-filter $\\mathcal{F}$ and prove\nthat it is equivalent to $K(\\mathcal{F})$ being hereditarily Baire.

        "summary": "  The reduced ring order (rr-order) is a natural partial order on a reduced\nring $R$ given by $r\\le_{\\text{rr}} s$ if $r^2=rs$. It can be studied\nalgebraically or topologically in rings of the form $\\text{C}(X)$. The focus\nhere is on those reduced rings in which each pair of elements has an infimum in\nthe rr-order, and what this implies for $X$. A space $X$ is called rr-good if\n$\\text{C}(X)$ has this property. Surprisingly both locally connected and\nbasically disconnected spaces share this property. The rr-good property is\nstudied under various topological conditions including its behaviour under\nCartesian products. The product of two rr-good spaces can fail to be rr-good\n(e.g., $\\beta \\mathbf{R}\\times \\beta \\mathbf{R}$), however, the product of a\n$P$-space and an rr-good weakly Lindel\\\"of space is always rr-good. $P$-spaces,\n$F$-spaces and $U$-spaces play a role, as do Glicksberg's theorem and work by\nComfort, Hindman and Negrepontis.\n",

The uniform norm topology arises from the $\\sup$-norm\ndefined on the collection $B_1^*(X)$ of all bounded Baire one functions. With\nrespect to this topology, $B_1^*(X)$ is a topological ring. It is proved that\nunder uniform norm topology, the set of all units forms an open set and as a\nconsequence of it, every maximal ideal of $B_1^*(X)$ is closed in $B_1^*(X)$\nwith uniform norm topology. Since the natural extension of uniform norm\ntopology on $B_1(X)$, when $B_1^*(X) \\neq B_1(X)$, does not show up these\nfeatures, a topology called $m_B$-topology is defined on $B_1(X)$ suitably to\nachieve these results on $B_1(X)$. It is proved that the relative $m_B$\ntopology coincides with the uniform norm topology on $B_1^*(X)$ if and only if\n$B_1(X) = B_1^*(X)$. Moreover, $B_1(X)$ with $m_B$-topology is 1st countable if\nand only if $B_1(X) = B_1^*(X)$. \\\\ The last part of the paper establishes a\ncorrespondence between the ideals of $B_1^*(X)$ and a special class of\n$Z_B$-filters, called $e_B$-filters on a normal topological space $X$.

Studies of this type is fundamental and\nimportant. They also remain to be immature and difficult. This is due to the\nfact that the dimensions are high and this has prevented us from studying the\nmanifolds in geometric and constructive ways.\n  Moreover, most of the present work is motivated by explicit studies of higher\ndimensional variants of Morse functions: especially so-called special generic\nmaps. The class of special generic maps is a natural class containing canonical\nprojections of unit spheres and Morse functions on homotopy spheres with\nexactly two singular points. Their images are in general (compact) manifolds\nsmoothly immersed to the targets and the dimensions of the images and the\ntargets coincide. They know much about the topologies and the differentiable\nstructures of the manifolds of the domains. The author has previously studied\nrelated problems and the present study is also a new study closely related to\nthem. Last, we also present a dream for contribution to studies of special\ngeneric maps and higher dimensional variants of Morse functions and manifolds\nadmitting them.\n",

It is divided in three parts where the\nrelated topics Bourbaki-completeness and Samuel realcompactification are\nstudied. In the first part of the thesis we study Bourbaki-completeness and\ncofinal Bourbaki-completeness (equivalently, uniform strong-paracompactness) of\nuniform spaces. In particular, we solve several primary problems related to\nproducts, subspaces, hyperspaces, metric spaces and fine spaces. Moreover, we\nshow that completeness and cofinal completeness are, respectively, equivalent\nto Bourbaki-completeness and cofinal Bourbaki-completeness whenever we consider\nuniformities having a base of star-finite covers. In the second part, we embed\nthe Bourbaki-complete metric spaces (and after, the Bourbaki-complete uniform\nspaces) into an universal space. Next, we characterized those metric spaces\nwhich are metrizable by a Bourbaki-complete metric or cofinally\nBourbaki-complete metric. In the third part we characterize the Samuel\nrealcompact spaces, that is, those uniform spaces which are complete with the\nweak uniformity induced by all the real-valued uniformly continuous functions\non the space. It turns out that these are exactly the Bourbaki-complete uniform\nspaces having no uniform partition of Ulam-measurable cardinal. Finally, as a\nnatural step in order to generalize the above result, we study which kind of\nmetric or uniform spaces satisfy that the Samuel realcompactification and the\nHewitt realcompactification are equivalent.\n",

In this paper, we use a class of finite state automata, called\n$\\Sigma$-automaton, to construct psuedo-metric spaces, and then apply them to\nthe study of classification of self-similar sets. We first introduce a notion\nof topology automaton of a fractal gasket, which is a simplified version of\nneighbor automaton; we show that a fractal gasket is homeomorphic to the\npsuedo-metric space induced by the topology automaton. Then we construct a\nuniversal map to show that psuedo-metric spaces induced by different automata\ncan be bi-Lipschitz equivalent.

Every wpo is\nNoetherian in its Alexandroff topology, and there are more; this prompts us to\ninvestigate an analogue of that theory in the wider context of Noetherian\nspaces.\n  The notion of maximal order type does not seem to have a direct analogue in\nNoetherian spaces per se, but the equivalent notion of stature, investigated by\nBlass and Gurevich (2008) does: we define the stature $||X||$ of a Noetherian\nspace $X$ as the ordinal rank of its poset of proper closed subsets. We obtain\nformulas for statures of sums, of products, of the space of words on a space\n$X$, of the space of finite multisets on $X$, in particular. They confirm\npreviously known formulas on wpos, and extend them to Noetherian spaces.\n  The proofs are, by necessity, rather different from their wpo counterparts,\nand rely on explicit characterizations of the sobrifications of the\ncorresponding spaces, as obtained by Finkel and the first author (2020).\n  We also give formulas for the statures of some natural Noetherian spaces that\ndo not arise from wpos: spaces with the cofinite topology, Hoare powerspaces,\npowersets, and spaces of words on $X$ with the so-called prefix topology.\n  Finally, because our proofs require it, and also because of its independent\ninterest, we give formulas for the ordinal ranks of the sobrifications of each\nof those spaces, which we call their sobrification ranks.\n",

It is\nobserved that these two graphs exhibit resemblance, so far as the diameters,\ngirths, connectedness, triangulatedness or hypertriangulatedness. are\nconcerned.

A selection function,\nS, specifies, for all meet-semilattices, certain subsets under consideration,\nwhich we call the ``designated'' ones; an S-frame then must have joins of (at\nleast) all such subsets and binary meet must distribute over these. A small\ncollection of axioms suffices to specify our selection functions; these axioms\nare sufficiently general to include as examples of partial frames, bounded\ndistributive lattices, sigma-frames, kappa-frames and frames. We consider right\nand left adjoints of S-frame maps, as a prelude to the introduction of closed\nand open maps.\n  Then we look at what might be an appropriate notion of Booleanness for\npartial frames. The obvious candidate is the condition that every element be\ncomplemented; this concept is indeed of interest, but we pose three further\nconditions which, in the frame setting, are all equivalent to it. However, in\nthe context of partial frames, the four conditions are distinct. In\ninvestigating these, we make essential use of the free frame over a partial\nframe and the congruence frame of a partial frame.\n  We compare congruences of a partial frame, technically called S-congruences,\nwith the frame congruences of its free frame. We provide a natural\ntransformation for the situation and also consider right adjoints of the frame\nmaps in question. We characterize the case where the two congruence frames are\nisomorphic and provide examples which illuminate the possible different\nbehaviour of the two.

For example, we show\nif $X$ is regular then $|X|\\leq 2^{c(X)^{\\pi\\chi(X)}}$ and $|X|\\leq\n2^{c(X)\\pi\\chi(X)^{ot(X)}}$, where the cardinal function $ot(X)$, introduced by\nTkachenko, has the property $ot(X)\\leq\\min\\{t(X),c(X)\\}$. It follows from the\nlatter that a regular space with cellularity at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ and\ncountable $\\pi$-character has cardinality at most $2^\\mathfrak{c}$. For a\nHausdorff space $X$ we show $|X|\\leq 2^{d(X)^{\\pi\\chi(X)}}$, $|X|\\leq\nd(X)^{\\pi\\chi(X)^{ot(X)}}$, and $|X|\\leq 2^{\\pi w(X)^{dot(X)}}$, where\n$dot(X)\\leq\\min\\{ot(X),\\pi\\chi(X)\\}$. None of these bounds involve $\\psi_c(X)$\nor $\\psi(X)$. By introducing the cardinal functions $w\\psi_c(X)$ and\n$d\\psi_c(X)$ with the property $w\\psi_c(X)d\\psi_c(X)\\leq\\psi_c(X)$ for a\nHausdorff space $X$, we show $|X|\\leq\\pi\\chi(X)^{c(X)w\\psi_c(X)}$ if $X$ is\nregular and $|X|\\leq\\pi\\chi(X)^{c(X)d\\psi_c(X)w\\psi_c(X)}$ if $X$ is Hausdorff.\nThis improves results of Sapirovskii and Sun. It is also shown that if $X$ is\nHausdorff then $|X|\\leq 2^{d(X)w\\psi_c(X)}$, which appears to be new even in\nthe case where $w\\psi_c(X)$ is replaced with $\\psi_c(X)$. Compact examples show\nthat $\\psi(X)$ cannot be replaced with $d\\psi_c(X)w\\psi_c(X)$ in the bound\n$2^{\\psi(X)}$ for the cardinality of a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Likewise,\n$\\psi(X)$ cannot be replaced with $d\\psi_c(X)w\\psi_c(X)$ in the\nArhangel'skii-Sapirovskii bound $2^{L(X)t(X)\\psi(X)}$ for the cardinality of a\nHausdorff space $X$.

Then, the relationships between the resulting soft topologies are\nobtained. With the help of an example, it is demonstrated that one formula is\nmore constructible than the other. Now, it is reasonable to ask which\n(topological) properties of a soft topology can be transferred to the set of\ncrisp topologies or the opposite. To address this question, we consider the\nstandard separation axioms and show how well these axioms can be preserved when\nmoving from a system of crisp topologies to the soft topology generated by it\nand contrariwise. Additionally, our findings extend and disprove some results\nfrom the literature.\n",

TDS\nis one of alternative branches of digital topology that studies constructing\nand modifying 2, 3 and n-dimensional digital image arrays in a computer and its\nmemory. Demands for mathematical theory of multidimensional spaces built of\nfinite number of points appeared in connection with the use of many dimensional\nimages in computer programs. This work presents, as examples, digital models of\nn-dimensional Euclidean spaces, n-dimensional spheres, a torus, a projective\nplane, etc. Methods of TMS can work successfully in such areas as biology,\nchemistry, industry, medicine, etc. The book is organized as follows. Digital\nmodels of continuous spaces are the intersection graphs of special locally\ncentered lamp covers of continuous spaces. Digital models are represented by\ngraphs, algebraic matrices and a set of unit cubes in n-dimensional Euclidean\nspace. The main mathematical characteristics of digital models of continuous\nspaces, such as the dimension, the Euler characteristic, the homology groups\nand others, are the same as those of their continuous counterparts.\nContractible transformations of digital spaces, that change the number of\nelements, do not change the mathematical characteristics and properties of\ndigital spaces. The main goal is to construct digital models of continuous\nspaces and to explain how to use the new methods to work with mathematical\nobjects. The emphasis is on introducing the readers to the basics and\nconceptual understanding of what TDS is.\n",

We do not use the fact that the Cantor set is\nembeddable into the complete Erd\\\"os space and that it is homeomorphic to the\nset of end-points of the Lelek fan. Instead, we use our recent techniques of\nMahavier products of closed relations to produce an embedding of the Cantor fan\ninto the Lelek fan.

The paper begins with answering all\nthe questions which were left open in our previous paper on the classifications\nof $Z$-ideals of $C(X)$ induced by the $U_I$ and the $m_I$-topologies on\n$C(X)$. Motivated by the definition of $m^I$-topology, another generalization\nof the topology of uniform convergence, called $U^I$-topology, is introduced\nhere. Among several other results, it is established that for a convex ideal\n$I$, a necessary and sufficient condition for $U^I$-topology to coincide with\n$m^I$-topology is the boundedness of $X\\setminus\\bigcap Z[I]$ in $X$. As\nopposed to the case of the $U_I$-topologies (and $m_I$-topologies), it is\nproved that each $U^I$-topology (respectively, $m^I$-topology) on $C(X)$ is\nuniquely determined by the ideal $I$. In the last section, the denseness of the\nset of units of $C(X)$ in $C_U(X)$ (= $C(X)$ with the topology of uniform\nconvergence) is shown to be equivalent to the strong zero dimensionality of the\nspace $X$. Also, the space $X$ is a weakly P-space if and only if the set of\nzero divisors (including 0) in $C(X)$ is closed in $C_U(X)$. Computing the\nclosure of $C_\\mathscr{P}(X)$ (=$\\{f\\in C(X):\\text{the support of\n}f\\in\\mathscr{P}\\}$ where $\\mathscr{P}$ denotes the ideal of closed sets in\n$X$) in $C_U(X)$ and $C_m(X)$ (= $C(X)$ with the $m$-topology), the results\n$cl_UC_\\mathscr{P}(X) = C_\\infty^\\mathscr{P}(X)$ ($=\\{f\\in C(X):\\forall\nn\\in\\mathbb{N}, \\{x\\in X:|f(x)|\\geq\\frac{1}{n}\\}\\in\\mathscr{P}\\}$) and\n$cl_mC_\\mathscr{P}(X)=\\{f\\in C(X):f.g\\in C^\\mathscr{P}_\\infty(X)\\text{ for each\n}g\\in C(X)\\}$ are achieved.\n",

We also prove some fixed point results for $T_1$\nlocally Hausdorff spaces and, introduced here, peripherally Hausdorff spaces.\nAn iterated function system on a topological space, IFS, is a finite family of\nclosed mappings from the space into itself. It is contractive if for every open\ncover of $X$ for some positive integer $n$ the image of $X$ via a composition\nof $n$ mappings from the IFS is contained in an element of the cover.

It was shown by Sapirovskii that $d(X)\\leq\\pi\\chi(X)^{c(X)}$ for\na regular space $X$ and the author observed this holds if the space is only\nquasiregular. We generalize this result to the class of all Hausdorff spaces by\nintroducing the nonquasiregularity degree $nq(X)$, which is countable when $X$\nis quasiregular, and showing $d(X)\\leq\\pi\\chi(X)^{c(X)nq(X)}$ for any Hausdorff\nspace $X$. This demonstrates that the degree to which a space is\nnonquasiregular has a fundamental and direct connection to its density and,\nultimately, its cardinality. Importantly, if $X$ is Hausdorff then $nq(X)$ is\n\"small\" in the sense that $nq(X)\\leq\\psi_c(X)$. This results in a unified proof\nof both Sapirovskii's density bound for regular spaces and Sun's bound\n$\\pi\\chi(X)^{c(X)\\psi_c(X)}$ for the cardinality of a Hausdorff space $X$.

We use a\nprobabilistic argument involving approximations by supmartingale processes to\nshow that in many cases there is no group topology between $\\tau_{ac}$ and the\nrestriction $\\tau_{co}$ of the compact-open topology.

First, motivated by an old problem of van\nDouwen, we construct from CH a locally compact and locally countable first\ncountable PNC space with countable spread. A space is deemed \"densely countably\ncompact\", denoted as DCC for brevity, if it possesses a dense, countable\ncompact subspace. Moreover, a space qualifies as \"densely relatively countably\ncompact\", abbreviated as DRC, if it contains a dense subset $D$ such that every\ninfinite subset of $D$ has an accumulation point in $X$. A countably compact\nspace is DCC, a DCC space is DRC, and a DRC space is evidently pseudocompact.\nThe Tychonoff plank is a DCC space but is not countably compact. A $\\Psi$-space\nbelongs to the class of DRC spaces but is not DCC. Lastly, if $p\\in {\\omega}^*$\nis not a P-point, then $T(p)$, representing the type of $p$ in ${\\omega}^*$,\nconstitutes a pseudocompact subspace of ${\\omega}^*$ that is not \\DRC. When\nconsidering a topological property denoted as $Q$, we define a space $X$ as\n\"hereditarily $Q$\" if every regular closed subspace of $X$ also possesses\nproperty $Q$. The Tychonoff plank and the $\\Psi$-spaces are not hereditary\nexamples. However, the aforementioned space $T(p)$ is a hereditary example,\nalbeit not being first countable.\n  In this paper we want to find (first countable) examples which separates\nthese properties hereditarily. We have obtained the following result.\n  (1) There is a DCC space $X$ such that no $H\\in RC(X)^+$ is countably\ncompact.\n  (2) If CH holds, then there is a DRC space $Y$ such that no $H\\in RC(Y)^+$ is\nDCC.\n  (3) If CH holds, then there is a first countable pseudocompact space $Z$ such\nthat no $H\\in RC(Z)^+$ is DRC.\n",

From the set theoretic point of view a natural\nquestion arises as whether one can broaden the picture and specify a class of\nideals (instead of a single ideal) each of which would have the similar effect.\nAs a natural candidate, we focus on a special class of ideals, namely,\nnon-$snt$ ideals ($snt$ stands for ``strongly non translation invariant\") which\nproperly contains the class of translation invariant ideals ($\\varsupsetneq\nFin$) and happens to contain ideals generated by simple density functions as\nalso certain non-negative regular summability matrices (but not all) which can\nbe seen from \\cite{DG6}. We consider the resulting class of\n$\\mathcal{I}$-Arbault sets and it is observed that for each such ideal, the\nclass of $\\mathcal{I}$-Arbault sets not only properly contains the class of\nclassical Arbault sets \\cite{Ar} but also a large subfamily of\n$\\mathbf{N}$-sets (also called ``sets of absolute convergence\") \\cite{Ft} while\nbeing contained in the class of weak Dirichlet sets. %In particular it properly\ncontains the family of $\\mathbf{N}_0$-sets which have been extensively used in\nthe literature (see \\cite{Ar, Ka, Ko}).

Motivated by their\ninvestigations of Julia sets, they asked what happens if the set of buried\npoints of a plane continuum is totally disconnected and non-empty. Curry, Mayer\nand Tymchatyn showed that in that case the continuum is Suslinian, i.e. it does\nnot contain an uncountable collection of non-degenerate pairwise disjoint\nsubcontinua.

The other one, here introduced, is expressed by using weak\npseudo-metrics, which (unlike the pseudo-metrics) do not necessarily vanish on\nthe whole of the diagonal of the cartesian product of the considered set. In\nthis case we will talk about weak Lipschitz structures. Since all topological\nstructures are defined by a a family of weak pseudo-metrics (as we will show in\nSection 4) we can find some connections between topological structures and weak\nLipschitz structures, and a link between continuous maps and weak Lipschitz\nmaps.\n  A central part of this paper is devoted to the weak Lipschitz uniformity\ndefined by a weak Lipschitz structure, which is introduced in Section 8. A\nnotion of uniform continuity with respect to weak Lipschitz uniformities is\nproposed and studied. In particular, we prove that the weak Lipschitz maps\nacting between two weak Lipschitz spaces are uniformly continuous with respect\nto the weak Lipschitz uniformities defined by the respective weak Lipschitz\nstructures.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper presents new results and reinterpretation of existing conditions\nfor strong structural controllability in a structured network determined by the\nzero/non-zero patterns of edges. For diffusively-coupled networks with\nself-loops, we first establish a necessary and sufficient condition for strong\nstructural controllability, based on the concepts of dedicated and sharing\nnodes. Subsequently, we define several conditions for strong structural\ncontrollability across various graph types by decomposing them into disjoint\npath graphs. We further extend our findings by introducing a composition rule,\nfacilitating the analysis of strong structural controllability in larger\nnetworks. This rule allows us to determine the strong structural\ncontrollability of connected graphs called pactus graphs (a generalization of\nthe well-known cactus graph) by consideration of the strong structural\ncontrollability of its disjoint component graphs. In this process, we introduce\nthe notion of a component input node, which is a state node that functions\nidentically to an external input node. Based on this concept, we present an\nalgorithm with approximate polynomial complexity to determine the minimum\nnumber of external input nodes required to maintain strong structural\ncontrollability in a diffusively-coupled network with self-loops.\n",

Besides, we also\ndevelop an $AP_u^\\ast(k_1,k_2, \\cdots, k_v)$-adjacency. For a digital image\n$(X, k)$, in case an $AP_1(k,k)$-($AP_1$-, for simplicity) adjacency on $X^2$\nexists, we formulate both an $AP_1$-$k$- and an $AP_1^\\ast$-$k$-group. Then we\nshow that an $AP_1^\\ast$-$k$-group is equivalent to a Han's $DT$-$k$-group\nbased on both the $C_{k^\\ast}$-adjacency on the product $X^2$ and the\n$(C_{k^\\ast}, k)$-continuity for the multiplication $\\alpha_1^\\prime:(X^2,\nC_{k^\\ast}) \\to (X,k)$.\n",

Similar to Hausdorff dimension, $t_{D}HD(\\cdot)$ is monotone with\nrespect to subspaces, and is a bi-Lipschitz invariant. It is also\nnon-increasing with respect to Lipschitz maps and satisfies a coarse\nintermediate dimension property.

In addition, we demonstrate that SLCG\npossesses well-defined characterizations, localization properties, and initial\nand final structures, establishing it as a topological category over groups.\n",

In particular we\nanswer a question asked by Mackowiak and Tymchatyn by showing that any\ncontinuum of arbitrary weight is a weakly confluent image of a hereditarily\nindecomposable continuum of the same weight.\n  We present two methods of constructing these preimages: (a) by\nmodel-theoretic means, using the compactness and completeness theorems from\nfirst-order logic to derive these results for continua of uncountable weight\nfrom their metric counterparts; and (b) by constructing essential mappings from\nhereditarily indecomposable continua onto Tychonoff cubes.\n  We finish by reviving an argument due to Kelley about hyperspaces of\nhereditarily indecomposable continua and show how it leads to a point-set\nargument that reduces Brouwer's Fixed-point theorem to its three-dimensional\nversion.\n",

Pavlov proved the following two interesting\nresolvability results:\n  (1) If a space $X$ satisfies $\\Delta(X) > \\ps(X)$ then $X$ is maximally\nresolvable.\n  (2) If a $T_3$-space $X$ satisfies $\\Delta(X) > \\pe(X)$ then $X$ is\n$\\omega$-resolvable.\n  Here $\\ps(X)$ ($\\pe(X)$) denotes the smallest successor cardinal such that\n$X$ has no discrete (closed discrete) subset of that size and $\\Delta(X)$ is\nthe smallest cardinality of a non-empty open set in $X$. In this note we\nimprove (1) by showing that $\\Delta(X) >$ $\\ps(X)$ can be relaxed to $\\Delta(X)\n\\ge$ $\\ps(X)$. In particular, if $X$ is a space of countable spread with\n$\\Delta(X) > \\omega$ then $X$ is maximally resolvable.\n  The question if an analogous improvement of (2) is valid remains open, but we\npresent a proof of (2) that is simpler than Pavlov's.\n",

We show that a\ncompact geodesic space X has a universal cover if and only if the following\nhold: 1) its revised and uniform fundamental groups are finitely presented, or,\nmore generally, countable; 2) its revised fundamental group is discrete as a\nquotient of the topological fundamental group. In the process, we classify the\ntopological singularities in X, and we show that the above conditions imply\nclosed liftings of all sufficiently small path loops to all covers of X,\ngeneralizing the traditional semilocally simply connected property. A geodesic\nspace with this new property is called semilocally r-simply connected, and X\nhas a universal cover if and only if it satisfies this condition. We then\nintroduce a topology on the fundamental group called the covering topology,\nwith respect to which the fundamental group is always a topological group. We\nestablish several connections between properties of the covering topology, the\nexistence of simply connected and universal covers, and geometries on the\nfundamental group.\n",

Such results are in a striking contrast with free balanced and free\nabelian topological groups cases (in standard varieties).\n  Another contrasting advantage is that the induced topological group actions\non free abelian NA groups frequently remain continuous. One of the main\napplications is: any epimorphism in the category NA must be dense. Moreover,\nthe same methods improve the following result of T.H.

The Jordan curve theorem says that a (simply) closed curve separates a\nsimply connected surface into two components. Based on the definition of\ndiscrete surfaces, we give three reasonable definitions of simply connected\nspaces. Theoretically, these three definition shall be equivalent. We have\nproved the Jordan curve theorem under the third definition of simply connected\nspaces. The Jordan theorem shows the relationship among an object, its\nboundary, and its outside area.\n  After the publication of the first version of the paper ({\\it L. Chen, Note\non the discrete Jordan Curve Theorem. In: SPIE Conf. on Vision Geometry VIII,\nvol. 3811, pp. 82-94. (1999).}), we found some statements in the original proof\nof the Jordan Curve Theorem were not explained well. One case was not proven in\ndetails. In this revision, we added two more minor definitions and make the\nproof more solid and sound when it is needed for embedding a discrete surface\ninto a Euclidean space.\n  In this revision, we also proved that the third definition of simply\nconnected spaces equivalent to the second definition of simply connected\nspaces.\n",

This means that the coarse structure of a\nhomogeneous cellular ordinal ballean $X$ is fully determined by the values of\nthe cardinals $cof(X)$ and $cov^\\sharp(X)$. For every limit ordinal $\\gamma$ we\nshall define a ballean $2^{<\\gamma}$ (called the Cantor macro-cube), which in\nthe class of cellular ordinal balleans of cofinality $cf(\\gamma)$ plays a role\nanalogous to the role of the Cantor cube $2^{\\kappa}$ in the class of\nzero-dimensional compact Hausdorff spaces. We shall also present a\ncharacterization of balleans which are coarsely equivalent to $2^{<\\gamma}$.\nThis characterization can be considered as an asymptotic analogue of Brouwer's\ncharacterization of the Cantor cube $2^\\omega$.\n",

This is a computational proximity\napproach to a Lenzen geometry of physical space. In both forms of physical\ngeometry, region is a primitive. Intuitively, a region is a set of connected\nsubregions. The primitive in this geometry is \\emph{region}, instead of\n\\emph{point}. Each description of a region with $n$ features is a mapping from\nthe region to a feature vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In the feature space,\nproximal physical geometry has the look and feel of either Euclidean,\nRiemannian, or non-Euclidean geometry, since we freely work with the relations\nbetween points in the feature space. The focus in these new forms of geometry\nis the relation between individual regions with their own distinctive features\nsuch as shape, area, perimeter and diameter and the relation between nonempty\nsets of regions. The axioms for physical geometry as well as the axioms for\nproximal physical geometry are given and illustrated. Results for parallel\nclasses of regions, descriptive fibre bundles and BreMiller-Sloyer sheaves are\ngiven. In addition, a region-based Borsuk-Ulam Theorem as well as a Wired\nFriend Theorem are given in the context of both forms of physical geometry.\n",

By a variety\nof arguments of a \"homological\" nature, it is known that the answer to this\nquestion is positive if the curve is sufficiently regular. The regularity\nhypotheses are needed to rule out the possibility of arbitrarily small squares\nthat are inscribed or almost inscribed on the curve; because of this, these\narguments do not appear to be robust enough to handle arbitrarily rough curves.\n  In this paper we augment the homological approach by introducing certain\nintegrals associated to the curve. This approach is able to give positive\nanswers to the square peg problem in some new cases, for instance if the curve\nis the union of two Lipschitz graphs $f, g \\colon [t_0,t_1] \\to \\mathbf{R}$\nthat agree at the endpoints, and whose Lipschitz constants are strictly less\nthan one. We also present some simpler variants of the square problem which\nseem particularly amenable to this integration approach, including a a periodic\nversion of the problem that is not subject to the problem of arbitrarily small\nsquares (and remains open even for regular curves), as well as an almost purely\ncombinatorial conjecture regarding the sign patterns of sums $y_1+y_2+y_3$ for\n$y_1,y_2,y_3$ ranging in finite sets of real numbers.\n",

In the discrete, a complex D can be called\nelliptic if a McKean-Singer spectral symmetry applies as this implies\nstr(exp(-t D^2)) is t-independent. In that case, the analytic index of D is the\nsum of (-1)^k b_k(D), where b_k(D) is the k'th Betti number, which by Hodge is\nthe nullity of the (k+1)'th block of the Hodge operator L=D^2. It can also be\nwritten as a topological index summing K(v) over the set of zero-dimensional\nsimplices in G and where K is an Euler type curvature defined by G and D. This\ncan be interpreted as a Atiyah-Singer type correspondence between analytic and\ntopological index. Examples are the de Rham differential complex for the Euler\ncharacteristic X(G) or the connection differential complex for Wu\ncharacteristic w_k(G). Given an endomorphism T of an elliptic complex, the\nLefschetz number X(T,G,D) is defined as the super trace of T acting on\ncohomology defined by E. It is equal to the sum i(v) over V which are contained\nin fixed simplices of T, and i is a Brouwer type index. This Atiyah-Bott result\ngeneralizes the Brouwer-Lefschetz fixed point theorem for an endomorphism of\nthe simplicial complex G. In both the static and dynamic setting, the proof is\ndone by heat deforming the Koopman operator U(T) to get the cohomological\npicture str(exp(-t D^2) U(T)) in the limit t to infinity and then use Hodge,\nand then by applying a discrete gradient flow to the simplex data defining the\nvaluation to push str(U(T)) to V, getting curvature K(v) or the Brouwer type\nindex i(v).\n",

We give various general conditions under which a locally\ncompact, $\\omega_1$-compact space is $\\sigma$-countably compact, i.e., the\nunion of countably many countably compact spaces. These conditions involve very\nelementary properties.\n  Many results shown here are independent of the usual (ZFC) axioms of set\ntheory, and the consistency of some may involve large cardinals. For example,\nit is independent of the ZFC axioms whether every locally compact,\n$\\omega_1$-compact space of cardinality $\\aleph_1$ is $\\sigma$-countably\ncompact. Whether $\\aleph_1$ can be replaced with $\\aleph_2$ is a difficult\nunsolved problem. Modulo large cardinals, it is also ZFC-independent whether\nevery hereditarily normal, or every monotonically normal, locally compact,\n$\\omega_1$-compact space is $\\sigma$-countably compact.\n  As a result, it is also ZFC-independent whether there is a locally compact,\n$\\omega_1$-compact Dowker space of cardinality $\\aleph_1$, or one that does not\ncontain both an uncountable closed discrete subspace and a copy of the ordinal\nspace $\\omega_1$.\n  Set theoretic tools used for the consistency results include the existence of\na Souslin tree, the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), and models generically referred\nto as ``MM(S)[S]''.

Combining these characterizations, we obtain such a\ncharacterization for spans of Boolean spaces with internal semigroups which we\nuse to describe the topo-algebraic counterpart of monadic second-order\nexistential quantification.

However, the expressions of the\ncoordinates of the Peano curve are not easily extendable to arbitrary $n$\ndimensions. In fact, the only known extension of the Peano curve to an\n$n$-dimensional space-filling curve, made by Stephen Milne in 1982, is rather\ngeometric and makes it difficult to establish basic properties of these curves,\nas continuity and nowhere differentiability, as well as more advanced\nproperties, as uniform distribution of the coordinate functions. Here, we will\nintroduce in a completely analytical way the $n$-dimensional version of the\nPeano curve. More precisely, for a given integer $n\\ge 2,$ we will define (by\nmeans of identities) the $n$ coordinate functions of a continuous and\nsurjective map from a closed interval to the unit $n$-dimensional cube of\n$\\mathbb{R}^n,$ which, for the particular case $n=2,$ agrees with the original\nPeano curve. With this description, as we shall see, one can easily establish\nall the properties we mentioned above, and also calculate the Hausdorff\ndimension of the graphs of the coordinate functions of this curve.\n",

Our goal is\nto further generalize descriptive frames so that the topology is an arbitrary\ncompact Hausdorff topology. For this, instead of working with the boolean\nalgebra of clopen subsets of a Stone space, we work with the ring of continuous\nreal-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space. The main novelty is to\ndefine a modal operator on such a ring utilizing a continuous relation on a\ncompact Hausdorff space.\n  Our starting point is the well-known Gelfand duality between the category\n$KHaus$ of compact Hausdorff spaces and the category $ubal$ of uniformly\ncomplete bounded archimedean $\\ell$-algebras. We endow a bounded archimedean\n$\\ell$-algebra with a modal operator, which results in the category $mbal$ of\nmodal bounded archimedean $\\ell$-algebras. Our main result establishes a dual\nadjunction between $mbal$ and the category $KHK$ of what we call compact\nHausdorff frames; that is, Kripke frames equipped with a compact Hausdorff\ntopology such that the binary relation is continuous.

However, this has almost exclusively been done using\nclassical logic, whereas much of the utility of the pointfree approach lies in\nits constructive theory, which can be interpreted in many different toposes.\nJohnstone has advocated for the development of a constructive theory of uniform\nlocales and wrote a short paper on the basic constructive theory via covering\nuniformities, but he never followed this up with a discussion of entourage\nuniformities or completions.\n  We present a more extensive constructive development of uniform locales,\nincluding both entourage and covering approaches, their equivalence,\ncompletions and some applications to metric locales and localic algebra.\n  Some aspects of our presentation might also be of interest even to\nclassically minded pointfree topologists. These include the definition and\nmanipulation of entourage uniformities using the internal logic of the\ngeometric hyperdoctrine of open sublocales and the emphasis on pre-uniform\nlocales. The latter leads to a description of the completion as the uniform\nreflection of the pre-uniform locale of Cauchy filters and a new result\nconcerning the completion of pre-uniform localic rings, which can be used to\neasily lift addition and multiplication on $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ (or\n$\\mathbb{Q}_p$) in the pointfree setting.\n",

We prove that\nfor such $X$ the free LCS $L(X)$ has the stronger property of not being\nmulti-Hilbert. We deduce that if $X$ is a $k$-space, then the following\nproperties are equivalent: (1) $L(X)$ is strongly nuclear; (2) $L(X)$ is\nnuclear; (3) $L(X)$ is multi-Hilbert; (4) $X$ is countable and discrete. On the\nother hand, we show that $L(X)$ is strongly nuclear for every projectively\ncountable $P$-space (in particular, for every Lindel\\\"of $P$-space) $X$.\n  We observe that every Schwartz LCS is multi-reflexive. It is known that if\n$X$ is a $k_\\omega$-space, then $L(X)$ is a Schwartz LCS \\cite{Chasco}, hence\n$L(X)$ is multi-reflexive.

For instance:\n  (i) If $\\kappa = cf(\\kappa)$ embeds in $\\mathcal{P}(\\omega)/fin$ and $S$ is\nany set of uncountable regular cardinals $< \\kappa$ with $|S| < \\min S$, then\nthere is a compactum $C$ such that $\\{\\omega, \\kappa\\} \\cup S \\subset dd(C)$,\nmoreover $\\lambda \\notin d(C)$ whenever $|S| + \\omega < cf(\\lambda) < \\kappa$\nand $cf(\\lambda) \\notin S$.\n  (ii) It is consistent to have a separable compactum $C$ such that $dd(C)$ is\nnot $\\omega_1$-closed.\n",

        "summary": "  A central role in topological dimension theory is played by Lipscomb's space\n$J_{A}$ since it is a universal space for metric spaces of weight $|A|\\geq\n\\aleph _{0}$. On the one hand, Lipscomb's space is the attractor of a possibly\ninfinite iterated function system, i.e. it is a generalized Hutchinson-Barnsley\nfractal. As, on the other hand, some classical fractal sets are universal\nspaces, one can conclude that there exists a strong connection between\ntopological dimension theory and fractal set theory. A generalization of\nLipscomb's space, using graphs, has been recently introduced (see R. Miculescu,\nA. Mihail, Graph Lipscomb's space is a generalized Hutchinson-Barnsley fractal,\nAequat. Math., \\textbf{96} (2022), 1141-1157). It is denoted by $J_{A}^{\\G}$\nand it is called graph Lipscomb's space associated with the graph $\\G$ on the\nset $A$. It turns out that it is a topological copy of a generalized\nHutchinson-Barnsley fractal. This paper provides a characterization of those\ngraphs $\\G$ for which $J_{A}^{\\G}$ is connected. In the particular case when\n$A$ is finite, some supplementary characterizations are presented.\n",

Complemented subsets were used\nsuccessfully by Bishop in his constructive formulation of the Daniell approach\nto measure and integration. Here we use complemented subsets in topology, in\norder to describe simulataneously an open set, the first-component of an open\ncomplemented subset, and its complement as a closed set, the second component\nof an open complemented subset. We analyse the canonical cs-topology induced by\na metric, and we introduce the notion of a modulus of openness for a cs-open\nsubset of a metric space. Pointwise and uniform continuity of functions between\nmetric spaces are formulated with respect to the way these functions inverse\nopen complemented subsets together with their moduli of openness. The addition\nof moduli of openness in the concept of an open subset, given a base for the\ncs-topology, makes possible to define the notion of uniform continuity of\nfunctions between csb-spaces, that is cs-spaces with a given base. In this way,\nthe notions of pointwise and uniform continuity of functions between metric\nspaces are directly generalised to the notions of pointwise and uniform\ncontinuity between csb-topological spaces. Constructions and facts from the\nclassical theory of topologies of open subsets are translated to our\nconstructive theory of topologies of open complemented subsets.\n",

The Ellis\nequiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal\nequiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly\nequicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.\n  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\\,(X)$\n(the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\\,(X)$ (automorphism\ngroup of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology.

We introduce a general\ncombinatorial method to construct non $\\sigma$-compact sets of reals with\nMenger's property. Special instances of these constructions give known\ncounterexamples to conjectures of Menger and Hurewicz. We obtain the first\nexplicit solution to the Hurewicz 1927 problem, that was previously solved by\nChaber and Pol on a dichotomic basis.\n  The constructed sets generate nontrivial subfields of the real line with\nstrong combinatorial properties, and most of our results can be stated in a\nRamsey-theoretic manner.\n  Since we believe that this paper is of interest to a diverse mathematical\naudience, we have made a special effort to make it self-contained and\naccessible.\n",

Here the product\ntopology is nontrivial, and the subgroups of Z^N make a rich source of examples\nof non-isomorphic topological groups. Z^N is the Baer-Specker group.\n  We study subgroups of the Baer-Specker group which possess group theoretic\nproperties analogous to properties introduced by Menger (1924), Hurewicz\n(1925), Rothberger (1938), and Scheepers (1996). The studied properties were\nintroduced independently by Ko\\v{c}inac and Okunev.

The suggested approach is based on\nthe concept of a discontinuity structure or scale Q in a topological space X.\nThis structure serves as a scale for the initial topology on X. Problems of\nscience and engineering need such a scale because all measurements and the\nmajority of computations are performed in a definite scale and problems of\nscalability are important both for physical theories and computational\nalgorithms. Taking a mapping of a topological space X with the discontinuity\nstructure Q into a topological space Y with a discontinuity structure R, we\ndefine (Q,R)-continuity, weak (Q,R)-continuity, and R-continuity of this\nmapping. Fuzzy continuous functions, which are studied in neoclassical\nanalysis, are examples of R-continuous mappings. Different properties of\nscales, Q-open, Q-closed sets, and (Q,R)-continuous mappings are obtained.\n",

We investigate which\ntopological properties are preserved by G-equivalence, with a special emphasis\nbeing placed on characterizing topological properties of X in terms of those of\nC_p(X,G). Since R-equivalence coincides with l-equivalence, this line of\nresearch \"includes\" major topics of the classical C_p-theory of Arhangel'skii\nas a particular case (when G = R). We introduce a new class of TAP groups that\ncontains all groups having no small subgroups (NSS groups). We prove that: (i)\nfor a given NSS group G, a G-regular space X is pseudocompact if and only if\nC_p(X,G) is TAP, and (ii) for a metrizable NSS group G, a G^*-regular space X\nis compact if and only if C_p(X,G) is a TAP group of countable tightness. In\nparticular, a Tychonoff space X is pseudocompact (compact) if and only if\nC_p(X,R) is a TAP group (of countable tightness). We show that Tychonoff spaces\nX and Y are T-equivalent if and only if their free precompact Abelian groups\nare topologically isomorphic, where T stays for the quotient group R/Z.

We establish that T-equivalence preserves the following\ntopological properties: compactness, pseudocompactness, sigma-compactness, the\nproperty of being a Lindelof Sigma-space, the property of being a compact\nmetrizable space, the (finite) number of connected components, connectedness,\ntotal disconnectedness.

Some of these results had been announced much\nearlier by Bell but without accessible proofs. We define the concept of the\nvariation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to the index of the\nmap on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. A fixed point theorem for positively\noriented, perfect maps of the plane is obtained. This generalizes results\nannounced by Bell in 1982. A continuous map of an interval to the real line\nwhich sends the endpoints in opposite directions has a fixed point. We\ngeneralize this to maps on non-invariant continua in the plane under positively\noriented maps of the plane (with appropriate boundary conditions). These\nmethods imply that in some cases non-invariant continua in the plane are\ndegenerate. This has important applications in complex dynamics. E.g., a\nspecial case of our results shows that if $X$ is a non-separating invariant\nsubcontinuum of the Julia set of a polynomial $P$ containing no fixed Cremer\npoints and exhibiting no local rotation at all fixed points, then $X$ must be a\npoint.

Under antisymmetry this property, also\nknown as quasi-uniformizability, allows one to compactify the topological space\nand to extend its order dynamics. In this work we study locally compact\n$\\sigma$-compact spaces endowed with a closed preorder. They are known to be\nnormally preordered, and it is proved here that if they are locally convex,\nthen they are convex, in the sense that the upper and lower topologies generate\nthe topology. As a consequence, under local convexity they are\nquasi-uniformizable. The problem of establishing local convexity under\nantisymmetry is studied. It is proved that local convexity holds provided the\nconvex hull of any compact set is compact. Furthermore, it is proved that local\nconvexity holds whenever the preorder is compactly generated, a case which\nincludes most examples of interest, including preorders determined by cone\nstructures over differentiable manifolds. The work ends with some results on\nthe problem of quasi-pseudo-metrizability. As an application, it is shown that\nevery stably causal spacetime is quasi-uniformizable and every globally\nhyperbolic spacetime is strictly quasi-pseudo-metrizable.\n",

        "summary": "  In recent years much attention has been enjoyed by topological spaces which\nare dominated by second countable spaces. The origin of the concept dates back\nto the 1979 paper of Talagrand in which it was shown that for a compact space\nX, Cp(X) is dominated by P, the set of irrationals, if and only if Cp(X) is\nK-analytic. Cascales extended this result to spaces X which are angelic and\nfinally in 2005 Tkachuk proved that the Talagrand result is true for all\nTychnoff spaces X. In recent years, the notion of P-domination has enjoyed\nattention independent of Cp(X). In particular, Cascales, Orihuela and Tkachuk\nproved that a Dieudonne complete space is K-analytic if and only if it is\ndominated by P. A notion related to P-domination is that of strong P-\ndomination. Christensen had earlier shown that a second countable space is\nstrongly P-dominated if and only if it is completely metrizable. We show that a\nvery small modification of the definition of P-domination characterizes Borel\nsubsets of Polish spaces.\n",

In particular, $K^n$ is a closed nowhere dense\nsubset of $K^{n+1}$. The proof essentially uses a multidimensional version of\nHindman's finite sums theorem. The third part of the paper lists several\nproblems concerning topologization of various algebraic structures, their\nZariski topologies, and related questions.\n",

From a lattice theoretic point of view, the\ndifference hierarchy over a bounded distributive lattice stratifies the Boolean\nalgebra generated by it according to the minimum length of difference chains\nrequired to describe the Boolean elements. While each Boolean element is given\nby a finite difference chain, there is no canonical such writing in general. We\nshow that, relative to the filter completion, or equivalently, the lattice of\nclosed upsets of the dual Priestley space, each Boolean element over the\nlattice has a canonical minimum length decomposition into a Hausdorff\ndifference. As a corollary each Boolean element over a (co-)Heyting algebra has\na canonical difference chain. With a further generalization of this result\ninvolving a directed family of adjunctions with meet-semilattices, we give an\nelementary proof of the fact that a regular language is given by a Boolean\ncombination of purely universal sentences using arbitrary numerical predicates\nif and only if it is given by a Boolean combination of purely universal\nsentences using only regular numerical predicates.\n",

This provides a positive answer to a problem of Arkhangel'ski for\nspaces of the form $C_p(X\\times Y)$.\n  Another corollary asserts that for every infinite Tychonoff spaces $X$ and\n$Y$ the space $C_{k}(X\\times Y)$ of continuous functions on $X\\times Y$ endowed\nwith the compact-open topology admits a quotient map onto a space isomorphic to\none of the following three spaces: $\\mathbb{R}^\\omega$, $(c_{0})_{p}$ or\n$c_{0}$.\n",

We also provide two applications of the method.\n  (1) We characterize $F_\\sigma$ ideals $\\mathcal{I}$ for which there is a\nHindman space which is not an $\\mathcal{I}$-space under the continuum\nhypothesis. This reduces a topological question of Albin L. Jones about\nconsistency of existence of a Hindman space which is not van der Waerden to the\nquestion whether the ideal of all non AP-sets is not below the ideal of all non\nIP-sets in the Kat\\v{e}tov order.\n  (2) Under the continuum hypothesis, we construct a Hindman space which is not\nan $\\mathcal{I}_{1/n}$-space. This answers a question posed by Jana\nFla\\v{s}kov\\'{a} at the 22nd Summer Conference on Topology and its\nApplications.\n",
