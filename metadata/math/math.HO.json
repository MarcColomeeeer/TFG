The first of these,\nextending an idea of Iverson, is the notation \"[P]\" for the function which is 1\nwhen the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This notation can\nencourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas\nin sums and integrals.\n  The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial\ncoefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in\nparentheses and read \"n choose k\", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be\nwritten on two lines in brackets and read \"n cycle k\", while Stirling numbers\nof the second kind should be written in braces and read \"n subset k\". (I might\nsay \"n partition k\".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The\nvirtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear\nin combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations\nsimilar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.\n",

In the field-theoretic\ndescription of interactive games the dialogues are defined naively as\ninteractive games of discrete time with intention fields of continuous time;\nthe correct mathematical formulation is proposed. The states and the controls\nof a dialogue correspond to the speech whereas the intention fields describe\nthe understanding. In the case of dialogues the main inverse problem is to\ndescribe geometrical and algebraical properties of the understanding. On the\nother hand, a precise mathematical definition of dialogues allows to formulate\na problem of the unraveling of a hidden dialogue structure of any 2-person\ndifferential interactive game. Such procedure is called the verbalization. It\nmeans that the states of a differential interactive game are interpreted as\nintention fields of a hidden dialogue and the problem is to describe such\ndialogue completely. If a 2-person differential interactive game is\nverbalizable one is able to consider many linguistic (e.g. the formal grammar\nof a related hidden dialogue) or psycholinguistic (e.g. the dynamical\ncorrelation of various implications) aspects of it.\n",

It is based on an\nextension of Fermat's Small Theorem (FST) to mod p^k for any k>0, and the cubic\nroots of 1 mod p^k for primes p=1 mod 6. For this solution in residues the\nexponent p distributes over a sum, which blocks extension to equality for\nintegers, providing a partial proof of FLT case1 for all p=1 mod 6. This simple\nsolution begs the question why it was not found earlier. Some mathematical,\nhistorical and psychological reasons are presented. . . . . In a companion\npaper, on the triplet structure of Arithmetic mod p^k, this cubic root solution\nis extended to the general rootform of FLT (mod p^k) (case1), called \"triplet\".\nWhile the cubic root solution (a^3=1 mod p^k) involves one inverse pair:\na+a^{-1} = -1 mod p^k, a triplet has three inverse pairs in a 3-loop: a+b^{-1}\n= b+c^{-1} = c+a^{-1} = -1 (mod p^k) where abc = 1 (mod p^k), which reduces to\nthe cubic root form if a=b=c (\\neq 1) mod p^k. The triplet structure is not\nrestricted to p-th power residues (for some p \\geq 59) but applies to all\nresidues in the group G_k(.) of units in the semigroup of multiplication mod\np^k.\n",

Based on this, we defend the thesis that\ncomprehension is compression, i.e., explaining many facts using few theoretical\nassumptions, and that a theory may be viewed as a computer program for\ncalculating observations. This provides motivation for defining the complexity\nof something to be the size of the simplest theory for it, in other words, the\nsize of the smallest program for calculating it. This is the central idea of\nalgorithmic information theory (AIT), a field of theoretical computer science.\nUsing the mathematical concept of program-size complexity, we exhibit\nirreducible mathematical facts, mathematical facts that cannot be demonstrated\nusing any mathematical theory simpler than they are. It follows that the world\nof mathematical ideas has infinite complexity and is therefore not fully\ncomprehensible, at least not in a static fashion. Whether the physical world\nhas finite or infinite complexity remains to be seen. Current science believes\nthat the world contains randomness, and is therefore also infinitely complex,\nbut a deterministic universe that simulates randomness via pseudo-randomness is\nalso a possibility, at least according to recent highly speculative work of S.\nWolfram.\n",

However this\ncourse will try to show that program-size complexity, which measures\nalgorithmic information, is of much greater philosophical significance. I'll\ndiscuss how one can use this complexity measure to study what can and cannot be\nachieved by formal axiomatic mathematical theories. In particular, I'll show\n(a) that there are natural information-theoretic constraints on formal\naxiomatic theories, and that program-size complexity provides an alternative\npath to incompleteness from the one originally used by Kurt Godel. Furthermore,\nI'll show (b) that in pure mathematics there are mathematical facts that are\ntrue for no reason, that are true by accident. These have to do with\ndetermining the successive binary digits of the precise numerical value of the\nhalting probability Omega for a \"self-delimiting\" universal Turing machine. I\nbelieve that these meta-theorems (a,b) showing (a) that the complexity of\naxiomatic theories can be characterized information-theoretically and (b) that\nGod plays dice in pure mathematics, both strongly suggest a quasi-empirical\nview of mathematics. I.e., math is different from physics, but perhaps not as\ndifferent as people usually think.

This\noriginal shape,whose use disappeared completely, proves that these numerals\nhave their origin in the Arabic letters. Contrary to what some hypotheses\npretend, particularly those that present them as drifting of Indian characters,\nthe 10 Arabic numerals that we use are, nothing else, 10 Arabic letters more or\nless modified and taken in the \"Abjadi\" order. The hypothesis of the Indian\norigin of the Arabic numerals is revealed a mistake denied by the shape of the\nArabic numerals and by the logic of the right to left representation of the\nnumbers and the algorithm of the elementary operations. The Arabic numerals\nthat simplified the writing of the numbers and the algorithms of the elementary\noperations are believed to be born in the Maghreb(North Africa). From Bejaia\n(Bougie) they passed in to Europe to give, after evolution, the modern Arabic\nnumerals : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. they also migrate to the Middle East\n(the Mashrek) to give, after transformations in shape and adding two Hebrew\nletters, the Arabic numerals, \"Mashrekis\", that are used currently in Middle\nEast.\n",

At about the same time Riemann successfully applied the geometric\nmethods that he set up in his thesis (1851) to the study of Abelian integrals,\nand the solution of Jacobi inversion problem. In response to Riemann's\nachievements, by the early 1860s Weierstrass began to build the theory of\nanalytic functions in a systematic way on arithmetical foundations, and to\npresent it in his lectures. According to Weierstrass, this theory provided the\nfoundations of the whole of both elliptic and Abelian function theory, the\nlatter being the ultimate goal of his mathematical work. Riemann's theory of\ncomplex functions seems to have been the background of Weierstrass's work and\nlectures. Weierstrass' unpublished correspondence with his former student\nSchwarz provides strong evidence of this. Many of Weierstrass' results,\nincluding his example of a continuous non-differentiable function as well as\nhis counter-example to Dirichlet principle, were motivated by his criticism of\nRiemann's methods, and his distrust in Riemann's ``geometric fantasies''.\nInstead, he chose the power series approach because of his conviction that the\ntheory of analytic functions had to be founded on simple \"algebraic truths\".\nEven though Weierstrass failed to build a satisfactory theory of functions of\nseveral complex variables, the contradiction between his and Riemann's\ngeometric approach remained effective until the early decades of the 20$^{th}$\ncentury.\n",

The central claim of\nthis paper is that a more nuanced understanding of mathematical proof and\ndiscovery may be achieved by paying attention to the aspects of mathematical\nargumentation which can be captured by informal, rather than formal, logic. Two\naccounts of argumentation are considered: the pioneering work of Stephen\nToulmin [The uses of argument, Cambridge University Press, 1958] and the more\nrecent studies of Douglas Walton, [e.g. The new dialectic: Conversational\ncontexts of argument, University of Toronto Press, 1998]. The focus of both of\nthese approaches has largely been restricted to natural language argumentation.\nHowever, Walton's method in particular provides a fruitful analysis of\nmathematical proof. He offers a contextual account of argumentational\nstrategies, distinguishing a variety of different types of dialogue in which\narguments may occur. This analysis represents many different fallacious or\notherwise illicit arguments as the deployment of strategies which are sometimes\nadmissible in contexts in which they are inadmissible. I argue that\nmathematical proofs are deployed in a greater variety of types of dialogue than\nhas commonly been assumed. I proceed to show that many of the important\nphilosophical and pedagogical problems of mathematical proof arise from a\nfailure to make explicit the type of dialogue in which the proof is introduced.\n",

Inasmuch as these\nare of a qualitative nature, it was required that they be expressed in a\nquantitative way in order to be objectified.\n  The first form of this objectification occurred in the case of 'archetypal\nresults', namely the Pythagorean triads and the internal ratio of the legs in\nthe right triangles. In the next stage, a 'scientific' treatment would come\nfrom a shift of objectification and descriptions inside an abstract theory,\nwhich would constitute the first logicomathematical knowledge. In this theory,\nthe 'archetypal results' were incorporated, generalized and acquired their\nunquestionable, supertemporal validity. The study presents a particular\nepistemological analysis of some of the main terms used in the beginnings of\nGeometrical Thought and Euclid's Elements, utilizing the theoretical apparatus\nof the theory of 'embodied mathematics'.

Consistent with this, in a survey we performed of pots and\ncontainers in modern locations, we could not find a single religious\ninscription. Here we delineate the number system of the Old European Script,\nand propose that the Old European Script may have been used for economic\npurposes. The delineation of the number signs of the Old European Script should\nfacilitate further understanding of the rest of the script and of the Old\nEuropean culture, especially as new archaeologic findings emerge.\n",

However,\nunlike the Dedekind construction, the construction proceeds directly from the\nintegers to the real numbers bypassing the intermediate construction of the\nrational numbers.\n  The construction of the additive group of the reals depends on rather simple\nalgebraic properties of the integers. This part of the construction can be\ngeneralised in several natural ways, e.g., with an arbitrary abelian group\nplaying the role of the integers. This raises the question: what does the\nconstruction construct? In an appendix we sketch some generalisations and\nanswer this question in some simple cases.\n  The treatment of the main construction is intended to be self-contained and\nassumes familiarity only with elementary algebra in the ring of integers and\nwith the definitions of the abstract algebraic notions of group, ring and\nfield.\n",

In a talk given at Z\\\"urich in the late 1940s, Weyl\ndiscussed F.Gonseth's dialectical epistemology and considered it as being\nrestricted too strictly to aspects of historical change. His own experiences\nwith post-Kantian dialectical philosophy, in particular J.G. Fichte's\nderivation of the concept of space and matter, had been a stronger dialectical\nbackground for his own 1918 studies in purely infintitesimal geometry and the\nearly geometrically unified field theory of matter (extending the Mie-Hilbert\nprogram). Although now Weyl distantiated himself from the speculative features\nof his youthful philosophizing and in particular from his earlier enthusiasm\nfor Fichte, he again had deep doubts as to the cultural foundations of modern\nmathematical sciences and its role in material culture of high modernity. For\nWeyl, philosophical \"reflection\" was a cultural necessity; he now turned\ntowards K. Jasper's and M. Heidegger's existentialism to find deeper grounds,\nsimilar to his turn towards Fichte's philosophy after World War I.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper the claim that Zeno's paradoxes have been solved is contested.\nAlthough no one has ever touched Zeno without refuting him (Whitehead), it will\nbe our aim to show that, whatever it was that was refuted, it was certainly not\nZeno. The paper is organised in two parts. In the first part we will\ndemonstrate that upon direct analysis of the Greek sources, an underlying\nstructure common to both the Paradoxes of Plurality and the Paradoxes of Motion\ncan be exposed. This structure bears on a correct - Zenonian - interpretation\nof the concept of division through and through. The key feature, generally\noverlooked but essential to a correct understanding of all his arguments, is\nthat they do not presuppose time. Division takes place simultaneously. This\nholds true for both PP and PM. In the second part a mathematical representation\nwill be set up that catches this common structure, hence the essence of all\nZeno's arguments, however without refuting them. Its central tenet is an\naequivalence proof for Zeno's procedure and Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. Some\nnumber theoretic and geometric implications will be shortly discussed.\nFurthermore, it will be shown how the Received View on the motion-arguments can\neasely be derived by the introduction of time as a (non-Zenonian) premiss, thus\ncausing their collapse into arguments which can be approached and refuted by\nAristotle's limit-like concept of the potentially infinite, which remained -\nthough in different disguises - at the core of the refutational strategies that\nhave been in use up to the present. Finally, an interesting link to Newtonian\nmechanics via Cremona geometry can be established.\n",

Since 1993, he\nhas also spent one semester each year teaching at the Department of Statistics,\nColumbia University, and has been the director of the Center for Applied\nProbability at Columbia University since its creation in 1993. Chris has been\nhonored worldwide for his contributions in probability, statistics and the\nhistory of statistics. He is a Fellow of the International Statistical\nInstitute and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and he is one of three\npeople to be a member of both the Australian Academy of Science and the\nAustralian Academy of Social Sciences. In 2003, he received the Order of\nAustralia from the Australian government. He has been awarded the Pitman Medal\nand the Hannan Medal.

Lee May, Jr.\nshowed that, treating each game as an independent event, a seven-game series is\nnot significantly fairer. In this paper, we take a different approach, taking\nhome-field advantage into account. That is, we consider a given series to\nconsist of two disjoint sets of independent events--the home games and the road\ngames. We will take the probability of winning a given road game to be\ndifferent from the probability of winning a given home game. Our analysis again\nshows that a seven-game series is not significantly fairer.\n",

        "summary": "  During the whole of 1874, Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker quar- relled\nvigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. That theory\npromised a \"general\" and \"homogeneous\" treatment of numerous questions arising\nin various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems,\nstated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered\nequivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two\ntheorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us\nto explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the\nmanipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to\nlinear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods\nfor the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --\nJordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect\nidentities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these\npractices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --\nin light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-\nchy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of\ngenerality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra\nand arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices,\nthis study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra\nwithout focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.\n",

An amalgam\nbetween the history of our modern numerals and the Indian mathematics history\nis made. Rational contradictions often passed under silence. A meticulous\nobservation of the numerals permits to affirm that our numerals are in fact\nmore or less modified Arabic letters. The \"Ghubari\" shape of the numerals shows\nthat the symbol of a numeral corresponds to the Arabic letter whose numerical\nvalue is equal to this numeral. The numerals don't have a simple resemblance\nwith some Arabic letters, but every number looks like the Arabic letter whose\nnumerical value is equal to this numeral. The elements of the ''Abjadi''\ncalculation gives us a theoretical support, independent of the letters and\nnumerals, witch explains our observation. Besides a re-lecture of the\ntestimonies of the medieval authors, particularly the testimony of Al-Biruni,\nthat is probably at the origin of all others testimonies speaking of the Indian\norigin of the numerals, is in agreement with the fact that our numerals are\nArabic letters. We have there a second way concerning the origin of our modern\nnumerals that is only to its beginnings. The deepened researches are necessary\nto understand the history of our numerals better.

Although they would be considered equivalent as\nregard to modern mathematics, not only had these two theorems been stated\nindependently and for different purposes, they had also been lying within the\ndistinct frameworks of two theories until some connections came to light in\n1872-1873, breeding the 1874 quarrel and hence revealing an opposition over two\npractices relating to distinctive cultural features. As we will be looking into\nthe 1874 quarrel, our purpose will be to show how the complex identities of\npractices such as Jordan s canonical reduction and Kronecker s invariant\ncomputation highlight some cultural issues such as tacit knowledge and\nperceptions of history peculiar to individuals or communities as well as some\nlocal ways of thinking such as disciplinary ideals and internal philosophies of\ngenerality and simplicity.\n",

It is\nknown that the current system, according to the Treaty of Nice, and the voting\nsystem proposed in the Lisbon treaty both strongly deviate from the square root\nlaw by Penrose. This is known to be the ideal voting rule under certain\nassumptions. In 2004 Slomczynski and Zyczkowski designed a voting system, now\nknown as the Jagiellonian Compromise. It satisfies the square root law with\nvery high accuracy. Each member state in this system obtains a voting weight\nproportional to the square root of the population. Additionally the quota is\nfixed in such a way that the voting power of each country is also proportional\nto the square root of the population.\n  In this paper we investigate to which extent a change of the quota in the\nTreaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon may bring the voting power closer to\nthe ideal square root distribution. Our computations show that even with\noptimal quota both systems are way off the ideal power distribution.\n",

Information-based complexity (IBC) is the study of algorithms and\ncomputational complexity of continuous problems. Examples of such problems\ninclude partial differential equations (in particular, the Schrodinger\nequation) very high dimensional integration, approximation, continuous\noptimization, and path integration. Because the computer has only partial\ninformation about the continuous mathematical problem adversary arguments at\nthe information level often lead to tight complexity bounds. This may be\ncontrasted with discrete problems where only conjectures that the complexity\nhierarchy does not collapse are available. This paper discusses precursors to\nIBC. It reports on the beginning of optimal iteration theory in the early 60s\nwhich was published in Traub's 1964 monograph. In the 70s Traub and\nWozniakowski began to formulate the foundations of IBC leading to their 1980\nmonograph. The paper continues with the development of IBC to the present.\n",

        "summary": "  I explain a direct approach to differentiation and integration. Instead of\nrelying on the general notions of real numbers, limits and continuity, we treat\nfunctions as the primary objects of our theory, and view differentiation as\ndivision of f(x)-f(a) by x-a in a certain class of functions. When f is a\npolynomial the division can be carried out explicitly. To see why a polynomial\nwith a positive derivative is increasing (the monotonicity theorem), we use the\nestimate |f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x-a)|<=K(x-a)^2. By making it into a definition we\narrive at the notion of uniform Lipschitz differentiability (ULD), and see that\nthe derivative of a ULD function is Lipschitz. Taking different moduli of\ncontinuity instead of |.|, we get different flavors of calculus, each rather\nelementary, but all together covering the total range of continuously\ndifferentiable functions. Using functions continuous at a, we recapture the\nclassical definition of differentiability at a point. We also see that ULD is\nequivalent to divisibility of f(x)-f(a) by x-a in the class of Lipschitz\nfunctions of two variables, x and a. The analogous fact is true for any\nsubadditive modulus of continuity. In this bottom-up, computational, one\nmodulus of continuity at a time approach, the monotonicity theorem takes the\ncentral stage and provides the aspects of the subject important for practical\napplications. The weighty ontological issues of compactness and completeness\ncan be treated lightly or postponed, since they are hardly used in this\nstreamlined approach that pretty much follows the Vladimir Arnold's \"principle\nof minimal generality, according to which every idea should first be understood\nin the simplest situation; only then can the method developed be applied to\nmore complicated cases.\" I discuss a generalization to many variables briefly.\n",

The aim of this paper is to show that the concept of\nprimes in Ancient China can be traced back to the time of Confuciusor (about\n500 B.C.) or more ago. This implies that the concept of primes in Ancient China\nis much earlier than the concept of primes in Euclid's \\emph{Elements}(about\n300 B.C.) of Ancient Greece. We also shows that the algorithm for counting the\ngreatest common divisor in Ancient China is essentially the Euclidean algorithm\nor the binary gcd algorithm. Donald E. Knuth said that \"the binary gcd\nalgorithm was discovered by J. Stein in 1961\". Nevertheless, Knuth was wrong.\nThe ancient Chinese algorithm is clearly much earlier than J. Stein's\nalgorithm.\n",

        "summary": "  The invention of non-Euclidean geometries is often seen through the optics of\nHilbertian formal axiomatic method developed later in the 19th century. However\nsuch an anachronistic approach fails to provide a sound reading of\nLobachevsky's geometrical works. Although the modern notion of model of a given\ntheory has a counterpart in Lobachevsky's writings its role in Lobachevsky's\ngeometrical theory turns to be very unusual. Lobachevsky doesn't consider\nvarious models of Hyperbolic geometry, as the modern reader would expect, but\nuses a non-standard model of Euclidean plane (as a particular surface in the\nHyperbolic 3-space). In this paper I consider this Lobachevsky's construction,\nand show how it can be better analyzed within an alternative non-Hilbertian\nfoundational framework, which relates the history of geometry of the 19th\ncentury to some recent developments in the field.\n",

Most of his original work was done before the\nFirst World War; it was highly theoretical and its applicability was\nquestioned. After having organized the first post-WWI International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1920, Villat became the editor of the famous Journal de\nmath\\'ematiques pure et appliqu\\'es and the director of the influential book\nseries \"M\\'emorial des sciences math\\'ematiques.\" From 1929 on, he held the\nfluid mechanics chair established by the Air Ministry at the Sorbonne in Paris\nand was heading the government's critical effort invested in fluid mechanics.\nHowever, while both his wake theory and his turbulence theory seemingly had\nlittle success outside France or in the aeronautical industry (except in the\neyes of his students), applied mathematics was despised by the loud generation\nof Bourbaki mathematicians coming of age in the mid 1930s. How are we to\nunderstand the contrasted assessments one can make of Villat's place in the\nhistory of fluid mechanics?\n",

It presents a case study on some algebraic\nresearches at the turn of the twentieth century that involved mainly French and\nAmerican authors. By investigating the collective dimensions of these works,\nthis paper sheds light on the tension between the tacit and the explicit in the\nways some groups of texts hold together, thereby constituting some shared\nalgebraic cultures. Although prominent algebraists such as Dickson made\nextensive references to papers published in France, and despite the roles\nplayed by algebra and arithmetic in the development of the American\nmathematical community, our knowledge of the circulations of knowledge between\nFrance and the United States at the beginning of the 20th century is still very\nlimited. It is my aim to tackle such issues through the case study of a\nspecific collective approach to finite group theory at the turn of the 20th\ncentury. This specific approach can be understood as a shared algebraic culture\nbased on the long run circulation of some specific procedures of decompositions\nof the analytic forms of substitutions. In this context, the general linear\ngroup was introduced as the maximal group in which an elementary abelian group\n(i.e., the multiplicative group of a Galois field) is a normal subgroup.\n",

We consider here the second method, and\nstudy the shape of the spiral strip, when unfolded on a table. We derive a\nformula that describes the corresponding flattened-out spiral. Cutting the peel\nwith progressively thinner strip widths, we obtain a sequence of increasingly\nlong spirals. We show that, after rescaling, these spirals tends to a definite\nshape, known as the Euler spiral. The Euler spiral has applications in many\nfields of science. In optics, the illumination intensity at a point behind a\nslit is computed from the distance between two points on the Euler spiral. The\nEuler spiral also provides optimal curvature for train tracks between a\nstraight run and an upcoming bend. It is striking that it can be also obtained\nwith an orange and a kitchen knife.\n",

In the\nperspective of today's mathematical disciplines - especially linear algebra -,\nthis note seems completely isolated in Poincar\\'e's works. This short paper\nactually exemplifies that the categories used today for describing some\ncollective organizations of knowledge fail to grasp both the collective\ndimensions and individual specificity of Poincar\\'es work. It also highlights\nthe crucial and transversal role played in Poincar\\'e's works by a specific\nalgebraic practice of classification of linear groups by reducing the\nanalytical representation of linear substitution to their Jordan's canonical\nforms. We then analyze in detail this algebraic practice as well as the roles\nit plays in Poincar\\'e's works. We first provide a micro-historical analysis of\nPoincar\\'e's appropriation of Jordan's approach to linear groups through the\nprism of the legacy of Hermite's works on algebraic forms between 1879 and\n1881. This mixed legacy illuminates the interrelations between all the papers\npublished by Poincar\\'e between 1878 and 1885 ; especially between some\nresearches on algebraic forms and the development of the theory of Fuchsian\nfunctions. Moreover, our investigation sheds new light on how the notion of\ngroup came to play a key role in Poincar\\'e's approach.

Also, after the first piece is taken, one can only take a piece\nwhich is adjacent to already-taken piece. This paper shows that, in this real\ntime setting, the starting player can always eat at least two-fifth of the\ntotal size of the pizza. However, this may not be the best possible amount the\nstarting player can eat. It is a modified problem from an original one where\ntwo players takes piece alternatively instead.\n",

But in both cases, he\ncompares infinitesimals favorably to imaginary roots. We agree with the\nmajority of commentators that Leibniz's infinitesimals are fictions rather than\nideal things. However, we dispute their opinion that Leibniz's infinitesimals\nare best understood as logical fictions, eliminable by paraphrase. This\nso-called syncategorematic conception of infinitesimals is present in Leibniz's\ntexts, but there is an alternative, formalist account of infinitesimals there\ntoo. We argue that the formalist account makes better sense of the analogy with\nimaginary roots and fits better with Leibniz's deepest philosophical\nconvictions. The formalist conception supports the claim of Robinson and others\nthat the philosophical foundations of nonstandard analysis and Leibniz's\ncalculus are cut from the same cloth.\n",

The latter's approach to the\nthree-body-problem has often been celebrated as a starting point of chaos\ntheory in relation to the investigation of dynamical systems. Yet, the novelty\nof Poincar\\'e's strategy can also be analyzed as having been cast out some\nspecific algebraic practices for manipulating systems of linear equations. As\nthe structure of a cast-iron building may be less noticeable than its creative\nfa\\c{c}ade, the algebraic cast of Poincar\\'e's strategy was broken out of the\nmold in generating the new methods of celestial mechanics. But as the various\ncomponents that are mixed in some casting process can still be detected in the\nresulting alloy, this algebraic cast points to some collective dimensions of\nthe M\\'ethodes nouvelles. It thus allow to analyze Poincar\\'e's individual\ncreativity in regard with the collective dimensions of some algebraic cultures.\nAt a global scale, Poincar\\'e's strategy is a testimony of the pervading\ninfluence of what used to play the role of a shared algebraic culture in the\n19th century, i.e., much before the development of linear algebra as a specific\ndiscipline. This shared culture was usually identified by references to the\n''equation to the secular inequalities in planetary theory.'' This form of\nidentification highlights the long shadow of the great treatises of mechanics\npublished at the end of the 18th century. At a more local scale, Poincar\\'e's\napproach can be analyzed in regard with the specific evolution that Hermite's\nalgebraic theory of forms impulsed to the culture of the secular equation.\nMoreover, this papers shows that some specific aspects of Poincar\\'e's own\ncreativity result from a process of acculturation of the latter to Jordan's\npractices of reductions of linear substitutions within the local algebraic\nculture anchored in Hermite's legacy .\n",

Admittedly, these theorems\nwere proved numerous times over the centuries. However, despite the popularity\nof these results, it seems that no thorough and up-to-date historical account\nof their proofs has ever been given, nor has an effort been made to reformulate\nthe oldest demonstrations in modern terms. The motivation of this paper is to\nput these strongly related theorems back in their historical perspective. More\nimportantly, we suggest a way to understand Descartes's original statement,\nwhich yet remains somewhat of an enigma. We found that this question is related\nto a certain way of counting the alternations and permanences of signs of the\npolynomial coefficients, and may have been the convention used by Descartes.\nRemarkably, this convention not only provides a ultra-simple proof of\nDescartes's rule, but it can also be used to simplify the proofs of the titular\ntheorems. Without claiming to be exhaustive, we shall present in this paper an\nhistorical account of these theorems and their proofs, and clarify their mutual\nrelation. We will explain how a suitable convention can help understand the\noriginal statement of Descartes and greatly simplify its proof, as well as the\nproofs of the above-mentioned theorems. With the exception of the proof of\nFourier's theorem and its generalizations, which run on rudiments of\ninfinitesimal calculus (Taylor's theorem), the proposed demonstrations are so\nshort and elementary they could be taught at the undergraduate level.\n",

Freiling's Axiom\nof Symmetry (AS) is one candidate for an intuitively justifiable axiom that,\nwhen appended to ZFC, is equivalent to the denial of CH. The intuition relies\non a probabalistic argument, usually cast in terms of throwing random darts at\nthe real line, and has been defended by researchers as well as popular writers.\nIn this note, the intuitive argument is reviewed. Following William Abram, it\nis suggested that while accepting CH leads directly to a counterexample to AS,\nthis is not necessarily fatal to our intuition.

The paper offers a complex analysis of Husserl's mathematical\nwritings covering calculus of variations, differential geometry, and theory of\nnumbers which laid the ground for his later phenomenological breakthrough.\nGeorg Cantor (1845-1818), the creator of set theory, was a mathematician who\nchanged the mathematical thinking per se. By analyzing the philosophy of set\ntheory this paper shows how was it possible (by introducing into mathematics\nwhat philosophers call 'the subject'). Set theory happened to be the most\nradical answer to the crisis of foundations. David Hilbert (1862-1943), facing\nthe same foundational crisis, came up with his axiomatic method, indeed a\nminimalist program whose roots can be traced back to Descartes and Cauchy.\nBringing together these three key authors, the paper is the first attempt to\nanalyze how the united efforts of philosophy and mathematics helped to dissolve\nthe epistemological crisis of the 19th century.\n  Keywords: Set theory, number, axiomatization, geometry, function, infinity.\n",

The Western philosophy of math originated in religious beliefs\nabout mathesis, cursed by the church. Later, mathematics was \"reinterpreted\",\nin a theologically-correct way, using the myth of \"Euclid\" and his deductive\nproofs. The fact of the empirical proofs in the Elements, was, however,\ncontrary to this myth. The discrepancy was resolved by Hilbert and Russell who\nrejected empirical proofs as unsound, reducing all mathematics to metaphysics.\nWe explain why that formalist metaphysics is anti-utilitarian and culturally\nbiased, not universal. Historically, most school-level math originated in the\nnon-West with a practical epistemology, but was absorbed in the West after\nsuperimposing on it an incompatible Western metaphysics, still used to teach\nit. This has made mathematics needlessly complex. Accordingly, math can be made\neasy and more universal by reverting to a more practical epistemology.\n",

It may be surprising that\nsuch systematic an integration formula exists for the inverse of a function\n$f$, a fact that seems to have been discovered for the first time by Laisant in\n1905, and seems not to be well known. More precisely, if $f$ is an invertible\nreal function, and if $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then the antiderivative\nof $f^{-1}$ is $xf^{-1}(x)-F\\circ f^{-1}(x)+C$. Laisant, and other authors\nafter him, assumes that $f^{-1}$ is differentiable, in which case the proof of\nthis formula is immediate. Recently, it has been shown by Key that this\nadditional assumption is unnecessary. In this paper, we give two different\nproofs of this result. The first proof, of geometrical spirit, relies to\nFubini's theorem, while the second proof, purely analytic, is based on the\nStieltjes integral.\n",

        "summary": "  The learning of mathematics starts early but remains far from any theoretical\nconsiderations: pupils' mathematical knowledge is first rooted in pragmatic\nevidence or conforms to procedures taught. However, learners develop a\nknowledge which they can apply in significant problem situations, and which is\namenable to falsification and argumentation. They can validate what they claim\nto be true but using means generally not conforming to mathematical standards.\nHere, I analyze how this situation underlies the epistemological and didactical\ncomplexities of teaching mathematical proof. I show that the evolution of the\nlearners' understanding of what counts as proof in mathematics implies an\nevolution of their knowing of mathematical concepts. The key didactical point\nis not to persuade learners to accept a new formalism but to have them\nunderstand how mathematical proof and statements are tightly related within a\ncommon framework; that is, a mathematical theory. I address this aim by\nmodeling the learners' way of knowing in terms of a dynamic, homeostatic\nsystem. I discuss the roles of different semiotic systems, of the types of\nactions the learners perform and of the controls they implement in constructing\nor validating knowledge. Particularly with modern technological aids, this\nmodel provides a basis designing didactical situations to help learners bridge\nthe gap between pragmatics and theory.\n",

This direct\napproach to calculus has three distinct features: (i) it defines derivative and\n(definite) integral without using limits, (ii) it defines derivative and\nantiderivative simultaneously via a derivative-antiderivative (DA) pair, and\n(iii) it posits the fundamental theorem of calculus as a natural corollary of\nthe definitions of derivative and integral. The first D in DD calculus\nattributes to Descartes for his method of tangents and the second D to DA-pair.\nThe DD calculus, or simply direct calculus, makes many traditional notations\nand procedures unnecessary, a plus when introducing calculus to the\nnon-mathematics majors. It has few intermediate procedures, which can help\ndispel the mystery of calculus as perceived by the general public.

A comprehensive approach, unconventional, is developed\nwhich implies having an overview of all pre-calculated alternatives. Difference\ns-r is the basis of the classification to be examined before taking the right\ndecisions, step by step, if difficulties are encountered. An adequate\nadjustment of s-r limits the number of all alternatives to 57, what is very\nfew. A four-component generator (2/3, 2/5, 2/7, 2/11) operates as a (hidden)\nmother-table.

We use the history of Dirichlet's theorem to understand some of the\nreasons that functions are treated as ordinary objects in contemporary\nmathematics, as well as some of the reasons one might want to resist such\ntreatment.

For this purpose I discuss and interpret, in a new\nperspective, the mathematical framework and the logic of the Third Man Argument\n(TMA) that appears in Plato's \"Parmenides\" as well as mathematical concepts\nfrom other Platonic dialogues. I claim that in this perspective the apparent\ninfinite sequence of F-Forms, that it is generated by repetitive applications\nof the TMA, converges (in a mathematical sense) to a unique F-Form for the\nparticular predicate. I also claim and prove that within this framework the\nlogic of the TMA is consistent with that of the Third Bed Argument (TBA) as\npresented in Plato's \"Republic\".\n  This supports Plato's intention for assuming a unique Form per Predicate;\nthat is, the Uniqueness thesis.\n",

This approach is from a statistics perspective\nand can help calculus learners understand calculus ideas and analyze a function\ndefined by data or sampling values from a given function, rather than an\nexplicit mathematical formula. The basics of this approach are two averages:\narithmetic mean and graphic mean. The arithmetic mean is used to define\nintegral. Area is used to interpret the meaning of an integral. Antiderivative\nis introduced from integral, and derivative-antiderivative pair is introduced\nas a mathematical operation entity. The graphic mean is an average speed in an\ninterval and is used to interpret the meaning of a derivative.\n",

David Tall (2013) suggests that Van\nHiele only saw application to geometry. Tall claims that only he himself now\nextends to wider application. Getting the facts right, it can be observed that\nTall misread Van Hiele (2002). It remains important that Tall supports the wide\napplication of Van Hiele's theory. Tall apparently didn't know that Freudenthal\nclaimed it too. There appears to exist a general lack of understanding of the\nVan Hiele - Freudenthal combination since 1957. Hans Freudenthal (1905-1990)\nalso suggested that Van Hiele only saw application to geometry, and that only\nhe, Freudenthal, saw the general application. Freudenthal adopted various\nnotions from Van Hiele, misrepresented those, gave those new names of himself,\nand started referring to this instead of to Van Hiele. The misrepresentation\nmay clarify why Tall didn't recognise Van Hiele's theory. Freudenthal mistook\nVan Hiele's distinction of concrete versus abstract for the distinction of\nreality versus model (applied mathematics). Freudenthal's misconception of\n\"realistic mathematics education\" (RME) partly doesn't work and the part that\nworks was mostly taken from Van Hiele. This common lack of understanding of Van\nHiele partly explains the situation in the education in mathematics and the\nresearch on this. Another factor is that mathematicians like Freudenthal and\nTall are trained for abstraction and have less understanding of the empirics of\nmathematics education.\n",

The usual proofs suggested by the historians\nof science derive from a proposition found at the end of Book X of Euclid's\nElements. But its conclusions, using the representation of fractions as a ratio\nof two integers relatively prime i.e. the proposition VII.22 of the Elements,\ndo not match the Aristotelian texts. In this article, we propose a new\ndemonstration conformed to these texts. They are based on very old results of\nthe odd/even theory. Since they use neither the proposition VII.22, nor any\nother result proved by a reductio ad absurdum, it seems to be the first result\nwhich was impossible to prove in another way. The significance of this result,\nrevealing a complete new territory in Mathematics, the field of irrational\nmagnitudes, accounts for the centrality gained afterwards by this kind of\nreasoning, firstly in Mathematics, then in all forms of rational discourse.\nFrom the consequences of this new proof, we can construe very simply the\nlecture on the irrationals in the mathematical text in Plato's Theaetetus\n(147d-148b).

Finally we treat the caput variationis which, in our opinion, is the\nfundamental concept of the Dissertatio.

Moreover, the\ndiscovery of non-Euclidean geometry, about 40 years earlier, had just been\ndemonstrated to be a \"true\" geometry on the same footing as Euclidean geometry.\nThese were radically new ideas, but henceforth the importance of the topic\nbecame gradually realized. As a consequence, the conventional attitude to the\nbasic geometric questions, including the possible geometric structure of the\nphysical space, was challenged, and foundational problems became an important\nissue during the following decades. Such a basic understanding of the status of\ngeometry around 1870 enables one to study the geometric works of Sophus Lie and\nFelix Klein at the beginning of their career in the appropriate historical\nperspective.\n",

In a recent breakthrough paper of Zhang, a finite upper\nbound was obtained for the first time on $H_1$; more specifically, Zhang showed\nthat $H_1 \\leq 70000000$.\n  Almost immediately after the appearance of Zhang's paper, improvements to the\nupper bound on $H_1$ were made. In order to pool together these various\nefforts, a \\emph{Polymath project} was formed to collectively examine all\naspects of Zhang's arguments, and to optimize the resulting bound on $H_1$ as\nmuch as possible. After several months of intensive activity, conducted online\nin blogs and wiki pages, the upper bound was improved to $H_1 \\leq 4680$. As\nthese results were being written up, a further breakthrough was introduced by\nMaynard, who found a simpler sieve-theoretic argument that gave the improved\nbound $H_1 \\leq 600$, and also showed for the first time that $H_m$ was finite\nfor all $m$. The polymath project, now with Maynard's assistance, then began\nwork on improving these bounds, eventually obtaining the bound $H_1 \\leq 246$,\nas well as a number of additional results, both conditional and unconditional,\non $H_m$.\n  In this article, we collect the perspectives of several of the participants\nto these Polymath projects, in order to form a case study of online\ncollaborative mathematical activity, and to speculate on the suitability of\nsuch an online model for other mathematical research projects.\n",

It became attractive to produce, under\nthe name 'statistics', more or less quantitative descriptions on any subject.\nBeyond literary records, the phenomenon can be measured by its semantic\npenetration in the press. Even if the ambition of most of these amateurs has\nremained strictly descriptive, some of them did raise the issue of proving\nthrough numbers. This is particularly remarkable, since within institutional\nscience, the techniques of statistical proving, that had been introduced by\nLaplace at the end of the 18th century, have remained largely ignored for a\nvery long time.\n",

The prime\ncandidates for a consistent density measure are overall density OD (also known\nas average density) and population-weighted density PWD (as recently adopted by\nthe US Census Bureau). In this note some less intuitive aspects of PWD are\nexplored, so that the consequences of adopting PWD as a density measure are\nbetter understood relative to OD. It will also be seen that one cannot entirely\ndispense with the need to define urban boundaries, to work preferentially with\nthe smallest parcels of land for which one has data, and to pay careful\nattention to the delineation of boundaries to ensure high-density and\nlow-density developments are allocated to separate parcels where possible.\n",

Mbirika uses mathematical tools from topology\n(specifically, knot theory) and combinatorics to analyze all the possible\nconfigurations that have a specific layout of three intertwining circles which\nwe find particularly compelling given Dante's description of the Trinity: the\nround figures arranged in a triangular format with rotational and reflective\nsymmetry. Of the many possible link patterns, we isolate two particularly\nsuggestive arrangements for the giri: the Brunnian link and the (3,3)-torus\nlink.

These women are underrepresented as conference\nspeakers, even more so than the underrepresentation of women among PhD-earners\nas a whole. This underrepresentation is the result of implicit biases present\nwithin all of us, which cause us (on average) to perceive and treat women and\nmen differently and unfairly. These mutually reinforcing biases begin in\nprimary school, remain active through university study, and continue to oppose\nwomen's careers through their effects on hiring, evaluation, awarding of\nprizes, and inclusion in journal editorial boards and conference organization\ncommittees. Underrepresentation of women as conference speakers is a symptom of\nthese biases, but it also serves to perpetuate them; therefore, addressing the\ninequity at conferences is valuable and necessary for countering this\nunderrepresentation. We describe in detail the biases against women in\nmathematics, knowing that greater awareness of them leads to a better ability\nto mitigate them.

In 1970 Academician Pontryagin rated the theory of sets as\nuseless for young mathematicians, and the translated works of Cantor were not\npublished. This article first describes the tragic fate of this translation.\n",

They created\na tradition which was strong in math till XIX century, especially in France.\nThe definitions were in binomial nomenclature mostly, but another type of\ndefinition appears in Cantor theory - it was the descriptive definition. As it\nused to be in human sciences, first the object had only one characteristic,\nthen as the research continued it enriched with new characteristics so we have\nfull-fledged conception. In this way the mathematics acquired its own\ncreativity. In 1915 Lusin laid down a new principle of the descriptive theory:\na structural characteristic is done, the analytical form had to be found. New\nschools of descriptive set theory appeared in Moscow in the first half of the\n20th century.\n",

No reader should be discouraged when he or she cannot\nunderstand everything on first readings - infinity is not a piece of cake.\n  The reasoning presented here is mainly due to the famous German mathematician\nGeorg Cantor (1845 - 1918). Despite the resistance from the mathematical\ncommunity at that time, he opened the door to infinity almost on his own,\ndramatically changing the foundations of mathematics.\n  The following notions and topics are treated: potential und actual infinity,\ncardinality and countability, Hilbert's hotel, Cantor's diagonal arguments and\nthe highly astonishing answer to the question of the validity of Cantor's\ncontinuum hypothesis.\n",

Then we associate a partial permutation matrix with a voice\nleading in a unique way and write an algorithm to easily transform any musical\ncomposition into a sequence of such matrices; we then generalise it in order to\ninclude in the model also rhythmic independence and rests. From that we extract\na vector whose components return information about the movements of the voices\nin the piece and hence about the complexity of the voice leading. We provide\nsome examples by analysing three compositions, also visualising complexity as a\npoint cloud for each piece. Finally, we interpret the sequence of complexity\nvectors associated with each composition, thus considering the position of each\nobservation with respect to time. The Dynamic Time Warping allows us to compute\nthe distance between two pieces and to show that our approach distinguishes\nwell the examples that we took into account, exhibiting a strong indication\nthat the notion of complexity we propose is a good tool to identify and\nclassify musical pieces.\n",

Can we introduce\na counter that for any possible number of medals would allow us to compute a\nnumerical rank of a country using the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals\nin such a way that the higher resulting number would put the country in the\nhigher position in the rank? Here we show that it is impossible to solve this\nproblem using the positional numeral system with any finite base.

However, it creates\nenormous confusion and frustration, particularly in the context of geographic\ninformation science, because of scale-related issues such as image resolution,\nand the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper argues that the\nconfusion and frustration mainly arise from Euclidean geometric thinking, with\nwhich locations, directions, and sizes are considered absolute, and it is time\nto reverse this conventional thinking. Hence, we review fractal geometry,\ntogether with its underlying way of thinking, and compare it to Euclidean\ngeometry. Under the paradigm of Euclidean geometry, everything is measurable,\nno matter how big or small. However, geographic features, due to their fractal\nnature, are essentially unmeasurable or their sizes depend on scale. For\nexample, the length of a coastline, the area of a lake, and the slope of a\ntopographic surface are all scale-dependent. Seen from the perspective of\nfractal geometry, many scale issues, such as the MAUP, are inevitable. They\nappear unsolvable, but can be dealt with. To effectively deal with\nscale-related issues, we introduce topological and scaling analyses based on\nstreet-related concepts such as natural streets, street blocks, and natural\ncities. We further contend that spatial heterogeneity, or the fractal nature of\ngeographic features, is the first and foremost effect of two spatial\nproperties, because it is general and universal across all scales.\n  Keywords: Scaling, spatial heterogeneity, conundrum of length, MAUP,\ntopological analysis\n",

Calculus is a necessary step\nin this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing STEM\nfields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested\nin STEM and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking\nCalculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a STEM major or are dissuaded\nfrom STEM disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on\nmainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for\nacademic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman\nbeing dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for\na man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material\nwell enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women\nand men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find\nwomen start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence\nthan men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack\nof mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of\nwomen. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women\nin STEM at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that simply\nincreasing the retention of women starting in college calculus would almost\ndouble the number of women entering the STEM workforce.\n",

We\nestablish a general setup for anamorphosis and central perspective, define the\ntotal spherical perspective within this framework, study its topology, and show\nhow to solve it with simple instruments. We consider its uses both in freehand\ndrawing and in computer visualization, and its relation with the problem of\nreflection on a sphere.\n",

Since\nthen, research on digital technology use has focused on the middle and high\nschool levels. Given the increasing diversity of digital technologies, and\ntheir varied underlying pedagogical goals and design choices, Clements' (2002)\nclaim that there is no single effect of the computer on mathematics achievement\nis as true now as it was a decade ago. However, many advances have been made in\nbetter articulating the range of design choices that are possible, their\npotential effect on the cognitive and affective dimensions on mathematics\nlearning, and their varying demands on the teacher. The aim of this chapter is\nto summarise the research literature on the use of digital technologies in the\nteaching and learning of mathematics at the k-2 level. In particular, we focus\non literature that contributes to our understanding of how the use of digital\ntechnologies affects and changes the teaching and learning of mathematics -\nthat is, how different affordances and design choices impact on the way\nteachers and learners interact and express themselves mathematically. By\ndigital technologies we refer to a range of tools including multi-purpose\ncomputer-based software programs, web-based applets, virtual manipulatives,\nprogramming languages, CD-ROMs, games, calculators, touchscreen applications\nand interactive whiteboards. The distinction between these various types is not\nalways evident and, indeed, one goal of this chapter is to provide useful\ndistinguishing features of these various technologies in order to help\neducators better evaluate and choose amongst them.\n",

Traditionally, players' names are used to set the\ninitial conditions for an instance of the game: its behaviour for an exhaustive\nset of pairings of popular UK childrens' names, and for more general initial\nconditions, is examined. Convergence to a fixed outcome (the desired result) is\nnot guaranteed, even for some plausible first name pairings. No pairs of top-50\ncommon first names exhibit non-convergence, suggesting that it is rare in the\nplayground; however, including surnames makes non-convergence more likely due\nto higher letter counts (for example, `Reese Witherspoon LOVES Calvin Harris').\nDifferent game keywords (including from different languages) are also\nconsidered. An estimate for non-convergence propensity is derived: if the sum\n$m$ of digits in a string of length $w$ obeys $m > 18/(3/2)^{w-4}$, convergence\nis less likely. Pairs of top UK names with pairs of `O's and several `L's (for\nexample, Chloe and Joseph, or Brooke and Scarlett) often attain high scores.\nWhen considering individual names playing with a range of partners, those with\nno `LOVES' letters score lowest, and names with intermediate (not simply the\nhighest) letter counts often perform best, with Connor and Evie averaging the\nhighest scores when played with other UK top names.\n",

For example, let's consider the basic concept of an\naxiomatic system: an axiomatic system can be very useful to organize, to\npresent, and to clarify mathematical knowledge. And, more importantly, logic is\na science with its own results: so, axiomatic systems are interesting also\nbecause we know several revealing theorems about them.

In fact, a wood panel covered\nby an overlapping circles grid pattern, found in the tomb of Kha, an architect\nwho served three kings of 18th Dynasty (1400-1350 BC), evidences that some\nsimple constructions with compass and straightedge were used in ancient Egypt\nabout nine centuries before Oenopides' time.\n",

The clearest model of classical harmony is\ngiven by the homophonic four-part pieces of music. The form of these pieces is\nbased on the earlier four-part chorale adaptations of J. S. Bach. Our paper\nlogically structures the musical phenomena belonging to the research area of\nclassical harmony. Its main result, the fundamental theorem of tonality,\nprovides a way to construct a complete axiom system which incorporates the\nwell-known classical compositional principles about chord changing and voice\nleading. In this axiom system, a piece complies with classical harmony if it\nsatisfies the formal requirements of four-part homophony and it does not\nviolate any classical chord-changing or modulational rules.\n",

While the D-shaped structure is generally\nrecognized by modern Pueblo peoples as a ceremonial complex, the exact uses of\nthe site are unknown, although the site has been shown to have key solar and\nlunar alignments. In this study, we examined the potential that the site was\nlaid out using advanced knowledge of geometrical constructs. Using aerial\nimagery in conjunction with ground measurements, we performed a survey of key\nfeatures of the site. We found apparent evidence that the ancestral Pueblo\npeoples laid out the site using the Golden rectangle, Pythagorean 3:4:5\ntriangles, equilateral triangles, and 45 degree right triangles. The survey\nalso revealed that a single unit of measurement, L = 30.5+/-0.5 cm, or one\nthird of that, appeared to be associated with many key features of the site.\nFurther study is needed to determine if this unit of measurement is common to\nother ancestral Pueblo sites, and also if geometric constructs are apparent at\nother sites. These findings represent the first potential quantitative evidence\nof knowledge of advanced geometrical constructs in a prehistoric North American\nsociety, which is particularly remarkable given that the ancestral Pueblo\npeoples had no written language or number system.\n",

He eliminates\nthe need of excentrics and equant points in astronomy; but he also describes\nlongitudes and latitudes with a unique method, with no more orbs than what is\nstrictly necessary to the longitudes. A better understanding of rotation as a\nspatial transformation enables this ultimate economy of thought.

His early life as as a soldier in the Royal\nArtillery and the events which led to him embarking on a career in mathematical\nresearch and teaching are dealt with in the first two chapters. Succeeding\nchapters explain the work in invariant theory and partition theory which\nbrought him to the attention of the British mathematical community and\neventually resulted in a Fellowship of the Royal Society, the presidency of the\nLondon Mathematical Society, and the award of three prestigious mathematical\nmedals and four honorary doctorates. The development and importance of his\nrecreational mathematical work is traced and discussed. MacMahon's career in\nthe Civil Service as Deputy Warden of the Standards at the Board of Trade is\nalso described. Throughout the thesis, his involvement with the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science and other scientific organisations\nis highlighted. The thesis also examines possible reasons why MacMahon's work,\nheld in very high regard at the time, did not lead to the lasting fame accorded\nto some of his contemporaries. Details of his personal and social life are\nincluded to give a picture of MacMahon as a real person working hard to succeed\nin a difficult context.\n",

His paper documented a\nnew method to calculate determinants that was based on Jacobi's Theorem. The\ncondensation method is presented and proven here, and is demonstrated by a\nseries of examples. The condensation method can be applied to a number of\nsituations, including calculating eigenvalues, solving a system of linear\nequations, and even determining the different energy levels of a molecular\nsystem. The method is much more efficient than cofactor expansions,\nparticularly for large matrices; for a 5 x 5 matrix, the condensation method\nrequires about half as many calculations. Zeros appearing in the interior of a\nmatrix can cause problems, but a way around the issue can usually be found.\nOverall, Dodgson's condensation method is an interesting and simple way to find\ndeterminants. This paper presents an elementary proof of Dodgson's method.\n",

Due to issues related to instructor-student communication and\nstudents' learning styles, a theoretical framework is built upon three\ncomponents for learning environments: inverted Bloom's taxonomy for educational\nlearning objectives, English-medium instruction (EMI) and integrating\ntechnology in the classroom. In this study, four different types of instruction\nwere designed; three classes were flipped while the fourth acts as a control.\nType A means entirely flipped with instructor-created videos and integrating\nCAS {\\sl Maxima}. Type B means entirely flipped with third-party videos. Type C\nis similar to Type A, but instead of the entire course being flipped, a single\ntopic is flipped. Type D uses the traditional lecture style. By considering\nexam scores and students' feedback, both quantitative and qualitative aspects\nof the flipped pedagogy were investigated. Quantitative analysis indicates a\nstatistically significant difference in the exam scores between instruction\nType A and Type C as determined by one-way ANOVA ($F(3,306) = 2.67$, $p =\n0.0477$) with small practical significance of the effect size ($\\eta^2 =\n0.0255$). Qualitative findings suggest that although students' engagement and\ncommunication with instructors have been enhanced, some challenges related to\nlanguage and culture, along with minimizing competition and learning about a\nnew technological tool remain to persist.\n",

The Tissot indicatrix is a graphical\nrepresentation of a field of ellipses on a map that describes its distortion.\nTissot studied extensively, from a mathematical viewpoint, the distortion of\nmappings from the sphere onto the Euclidean plane that are used in drawing\ngeographical maps, and more generally he developed a theory for the distorsion\nof mappings between general surfaces. His ideas are at the heart of the work on\nquasiconformal mappings that was developed several decades after him by\nGr{\\\"o}tzsch, Lavrentieff, Ahlfors and Teichm{\\\"u}ller. Gr{\\\"o}tzsch mentions\nthe work of Tissot and he uses the terminology related to his name (in\nparticular, Gr{\\\"o}tzsch uses the Tissot indicatrix). Teichm{\\\"u}ller mentions\nthe name of Tissot in a historical section in one of his fundamental papers\nwhere he claims that quasiconformal mappings were used by geographers, but\nwithout giving any hint about the nature of Tissot's work. The name of Tissot\nis also missing from all the historical surveys on quasiconformal mappings. In\nthe present paper, we report on this work of Tissot. We shall also mention some\nrelated works on cartography, on the differential geometry of surfaces, and on\nthe theory of quasiconformal mappings. This will place Tissot's work in its\nproper context. The final version of this paper will appear in the journal\nArch. Hist. Exact Sciences.\n",

Recent studies have provided evidence in\nfavour of adopting early warning systems as a means of identifying at-risk\nstudents. Many of these early warning systems rely on data from students'\nengagement with Learning Management Systems (LMSs). Our study examines eight\nprediction methods, and investigates the optimal time in a course to apply an\nearly warning system. We present findings from a statistics university course\nwhich has a large proportion of resources on the LMS Blackboard and weekly\ncontinuous assessment. We identify weeks 5-6 of our course (half way through\nthe semester) as an optimal time to implement an early warning system, as it\nallows time for the students to make changes to their study patterns whilst\nretaining reasonable prediction accuracy. Using detailed (fine-grained)\nvariables, clustering and our final prediction method of BART (Bayesian\nAdditive Regressive Trees) we are able to predict students' final grade by week\n6 based on mean absolute error (MAE) to 6.5 percentage points. We provide our R\ncode for implementation of the prediction methods used in a GitHub repository.\n",

Besides, the\nBenford's formula was derived with no use of any additional guiding sources.\n  Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of a group of certain discrete functions\nwas performed by approximating the functions to the above-mentioned continuous\nones, taking limits, and other methods.\n  The work can be applied for calculating the first digit probabilities of more\nadvanced functions as well while using the same approach. Furthermore, the\ntechnique can be useful while dealing with a large set of highly approximate\nnumbers and a conclusion about their nature needs to be made.\n",

With the verse What\nis god; What is not a god; what is there in between them, the ancient poet\nEuripides sets foundations to the kind of logic that one can consider as a\npredecessor of Fuzzy Logic. It is worth noting that when Seferis received the\nNobel Prize in Stockholm in 1963, he stated: Right now I feel I am a\ncontradiction myself, a sentence charged with the new language of mathematical\nlogic of the 20th century.

        "summary": "  This paper deals with the algebraic structure of the sequence of harmonics\nwhen combined with equal temperaments. Fractals and the golden ratio appear\nsurprisingly on the way. The sequence of physical harmonics is an increasingly\nenumerable submonoid of (R+,+) whose pairs of consecutive terms get arbitrarily\nclose as they grow. These properties suggest the definition of a new\nmathematical object which we denote a tempered monoid. Mapping the elements of\nthe tempered monoid of physical harmonics from R to N may be considered\ntantamount to defining equal temperaments. The number of equal parts of the\noctave in an equal temperament corresponds to the multiplicity of the related\nnumerical semigroup. Analyzing the sequence of musical harmonics we derive two\nimportant properties that tempered monoids may have: that of being\nproduct-compatible and that of being fractal. We demonstrate that, up to\nnormalization, there is only one product-compatible tempered monoid, which is\nthe logarithmic monoid, and there is only one nonbisectional fractal monoid\nwhich is generated by the golden ratio. The example of half-closed cylindrical\npipes imposes a third property to the sequence of musical harmonics, the\nso-called odd-filterability property. We prove that the maximum number of equal\ndivisions of the octave such that the discretizations of the golden fractal\nmonoid and the logarithmic monoid coincide, and such that the discretization is\nodd-filterable is 12. This is nothing else but the number of equal divisions of\nthe octave in classical Western music.\n",

Piaget and R. Garc\\'ia \\citep{piag89}. Instead of\naddressing Newton's equations as a set of axioms, ultimately given by the\nrevelation of a prodigious mind, we search for the fundamental knowledge,\nbeliefs and provisional assumptions that can produce classical mechanics. We\nstart by developing our main tool: the No Arbitrariness Principle, that we\npresent in a form that is apt for a mathematical theory as classical mechanics.\nSubsequently, we introduce the presence of the observer, analysing then the\nrelation objective-subjective and seeking objectivity going across\nsubjectivity. We take special care of establishing the precedence among all\ncontributions to mechanics, something that can be better appreciated by\nconsidering the consequences of removing them: (a) the consequence of\nrenouncing logic and the laws of understanding is not being able to understand\nthe world, (b) renouncing the early elaborations of primary concepts such as\ntime and space leads to a dissociation between everyday life and physics, the\nlatter becoming entirely pragmatic and justified \\emph{a-posteriori} (because\nit is convenient), (c) changing our temporary beliefs has no real cost other\nthan effort. Finally, we exemplify the present approach by reconsidering the\nconstancy of the velocity of light. It is shown that it is a result of\nNewtonian mechanics, rather than being in contradiction with it. We also\nindicate the hidden assumption that leads to the (apparent) contradiction.\n",

        "summary": "  Andrei Bely's modernist novel \"Petersburg,\" first published in 1913, is\nconsidered a pinnacle of the Symbolist movement. Nabokov famously ranked it as\none of the four greatest masterpieces of 20th-century prose. The author's\nfather, Bugaev, was an influential mathematician and for 12 years served as the\npresident of the Moscow Mathematical Society; he was also a source of\ninspiration for one of the main characters in the son's novel. While the\nphilosophical views and political leanings of the mathematicians surrounding\nBely, and their impact on \"Petersburg,\" have been a topic of recent academic\ninterest, there has not yet been a direct investigation of the surprisingly\nfrequent and sophisticated mathematical passages in the book itself. We attempt\nhere to rectify this gap in the scholarly literature, and in doing so find a\nrich tapestry of mathematical ideas and allusions.\n",

This treatise is one of the latest and one\nof the most elaborate medieval work on theoretical astronomy; it is famous\ntoday for having provided the first viable lunar model in terms of the distance\nMoon-Earth. Although demonstrations have been consigned to another manuscript\nwhich is now lost, we reconstruct the physical models in our mathematical\ncommentary, and we attempt at a better historical understanding of the nascent\nconcepts of space transformations, solid reference frames, trajectory, etc.\nPredictions of the models are to be compared to observations and to other\ncontemporary models, as well as theoretical premises; in turn, when records of\nobservations are missing, those have to be recalculated by modern means. Part\nof our commentary is devoted to the latitudinal movement of the five planets:\nIbn al-\\v{S}\\=atir's work on this problem belongs to a tradition initiated by\nIbn al-Haytham three centuries before. Ibn al-\\v{S}\\=atir addresses a clever\ncriticism to the work of his predecessor Nas\\=ir al-D\\=in al-T\\=us\\=i on this\nproblem, thus revealing a better understanding of affine rotations in space.\nMany other criticisms by Ibn al-\\v{S}\\=atir, especially to the astronomers\nworking at Mar\\=a\\.ga during the 13th century, also contribute to a better\nknowledge of their own work.\n",

His account of these different classes of\nrelations figures prominently in the development of his algebraic and\ndiagrammatic systems of mathematical logic. Our aim in this essay is to\nreconstruct and examine central features of the classificatory system that he\ndevelops. Given the complexity of the system, we will focus our attention on\nthe classification and explanation of of degenerate and genuine dyadic\nrelations, and we will take up the discussion of triadic relations elsewhere.\nOne of our reasons for wanting to explore this account of relations is to\nbetter understand how it informed the later development of relations as they\nfigure in the history of mathematical logic. The earlier work of Peirce on\ndyadic relations influenced the development of the account of dyadic logical\nrelations in works of Ernst Schroder, Leopold Lowenheim, Thoralf Skolem and\nAlfred Tarski. As such, our primary aim in this essay is to trace the early\ndevelopment of these ideas about the formal relation of the dyad for the sake\nof better understanding how it might have influenced these later developments.\n",

Let ABC be an isosceles triangle. Define circle C to be the circle\nsymmetric relative to AB to the circumscribed circle of the triangle ABC. Then\nthe locus of intersection points of pairs of equal cevians is the union of the\nbase AB, the triangle's axis of symmetry, and the circle C.\n",

A\nnumerical method reduces such an equation to arithmetic for quick\nvisualization, but this can be misleading if the method is not developed and\noperated carefully due to numerical oscillations, instabilities, and other\nartifacts of the programmed solution.

These techniques are illustrated through\nseveral detailed examples with a relevant governing equation, and lead to open\nquestions suggested for undergraduate-accessible research.\n",

In this paper, we present and analyze\nadmission data of students from different groups entering a math PhD program at\na southern California university. We observe that some factors correlate with\nsuccess in the PhD program (defined as obtaining a PhD degree within a\ntime-limit). According to our analysis, GRE scores correlate with success, but\ninterestingly, the verbal part of the GRE score has a higher predictive power\ncompared to the quantitative part. Further, we observe that undergraduate\nstudent GPA does not correlate with success (there is even a slight negative\nslope in the relationship between GPA and the probability of success). This\ncounterintuitive observation is explained once undergraduate institutions are\nseparated by tiers: students from \"higher tiers\" have undergone a more rigorous\ntraining program; they on average have a slightly lower GPA but run a slightly\nhigher probability to succeed. Finally, a gender gap is observed in the\nprobability to succeed with female students having a lower probability to\nfinish with a PhD despite the same undergraduate performance, compared to\nmales. This gap is reversed if we only consider foreign graduate students. It\nis our hope that this study will encourage other universities to perform\nsimilar analyses, in order to design better admission and retention strategies\nfor Math PhD programs.\n",

After an introduction and a look at Robinson's\nand Nelson's approaches to classical nonstandard analysis, three desiderata for\nan intuitionistic construction of infinitesimals are extracted from Brouwer's\nwritings. These cannot be met, but in explicitly Brouwerian settings what might\nin different ways be called approximations to infinitesimals have been\ndeveloped by early Brouwer, Vesley, and Reeb.

In\nthe final section of his work he described what he called `infinite number\nexpressions' and `measurable numbers'. This work was evidently an attempt to\nprovide an improved proof of the sufficiency of the criterion usually known as\nthe `Cauchy criterion' for the convergence of an infinite sequence. Bolzano had\nin fact published this criterion four years earlier than Cauchy who, in his\nwork of 1821, made no attempt at a proof. Any such proof required the\nconstruction or definition of real numbers and this, in essence, was what\nBolzano achieved in his work on measurable numbers. It therefore pre-dates the\nwell-known constructions of Dedekind, Cantor and many others by several\ndecades. Bolzano's manuscript was partially published in 1962 and more fully\npublished in 1976. We give an account of measurable numbers, the properties\nBolzano proved about them, and the controversial reception they have prompted\nsince their publication.\n",

Motivated by recent developments in\ndependent type theory and infinity category theory, it presents a history of\nideas around the concepts of truth, proof, equality, and equivalence as well as\ntheir relation to human thought. We describe a few selected ideas of Platon,\nAristoteles, Leibniz, Kant, Frege and others and then pass to the results of\nG\\\"odel and Tarski about incompleteness, undecidability and truth in deductive\nsystems and their semantic models. The main focus of this text, however, is the\ndevelopment of dependent type theory through the work of Per Martin--L\\\"of and\nrecent developments in homotopy type theory, i.e., the univalent foundations\nprogram of Vladimir Voevodsky and others. These theories allow the notion of\nidentity types, which gives new possibilities for handling equality, symmetry,\nequivalence and isomorphisms in a conceptual way. Martin--L\\\"of type theories\nhave semantic models in (infinity,1)-categories, which are related to\nsimplicial localizations of Quillen model categories. The interaction of type\ntheory with infinity category theory is a new paradigm for a structural view on\nmathematics which is superior to set theory. It also supports the recent\nemerging trend for computer assisted proofs in mathematics and verification of\nalgorithms and software in computer science.\n",

Though there are theoretical nuances between the\ntwo phrases, both kinds of labor involve the management of emotions; some acts\nassociated with these constructs involve caring, listening, comforting,\nreassuring, and smiling. In this article I explore the different ways academic\nmathematicians are called to provide emotional labor in the discipline, thereby\nilluminating a rarely visible component of a mathematical life in the academy.\nUnderlying this work is my contention that a conceptualization of labor\ninvolved in managing emotions is of value to the project of understanding the\ncharacter, values, and boundaries of such a life. In order to investigate the\nvarious dimensions of emotional labor in the context of academic mathematics, I\nextend the basic framework of Morris and Feldman [33] and then apply this\nextended framework to the mathematical sciences. Other researchers have mainly\nfocused on the negative effects of emotional labor on a laborer's physical,\nemotional, and mental health, and several examples in this article align with\nthis framing. However, at the end of the article, I argue that mathematical\ncommunities and mentoring structures such as EDGE help diminish some of the\nnegative aspects of emotional labor while also accentuating the positives.\n",

Its central part\nis the development of an empirical conception of mathematics that plays a\ncentral r\\^ole in the sequel. Our analysis is based on the notion of experience\naccording to William James; it is also inspired by certain aspects of Per\nMartin-L\\\"of's philosophy. It provides a way of thinking the firm certainty\nwith which proofs endow theorems, while invalidating the interpretation of this\ncertainty as the mark of a direct access to an absolute and transcendental\ntruth. The sequel of our essay builds on this analysis for defining a sort of\nquasi-mode of existence appropriate for mathematical beings that respects the\nprincipal features of modes of existence according to the latourian ontology.\nIn the conclusion, the way this quasi-mode might be integrated into this\nontology is discussed, in particular with respect to the mode of reference that\nprevails in many other sciences.\n",

        "summary": "  In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called\n'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, the first dialogue of a trilogy\nincluding the Sophist and the Statesman. In the present article, we study an\nimportant point in more detail, the 'definition' of 'powers'\n('$\\delta\\upsilon\\nu\\acute\\alpha\\mu\\epsilon\\iota\\varsigma$'). While in\n[Brisson-Ofman2], it was shown that the different steps to get the definition\nare mathematically and philosophically incorrect, it is explained why the\ndefinition itself is problematic. However, it is the first example, at least in\nthe trilogy, of a definition by division. This point is generally ignored by\nmodern commentators though, as we will try to show, it gives rise, in a\nmathematical context, to at least three fundamental questions: the meaning(s)\nof 'logos', the connection between 'elements and compound' and, of course the\nquestion of the 'power(s)'. One of the main consequences of our works on\nTheaetetus' 'mathematical passage', including the present one, is to challenge\nthe so-called 'main standard interpretation'. In particular, following\n[Ofman2014], we question the claim that Plato praises and glorifies both the\nmathematician Theodorus and the young Theaetetus. According to our analysis,\nsuch a claim, considered as self-evident, entails many errors. Conversely, our\nanalysis of Theaetetus' mathematical mistakes highlights the main cause of some\ngenerally overlooked failures in the dialogue: the forgetting of the 'logos',\nfirst in the 'mathematical part', then in the following discussion, and finally\nthe failure of the four successive tries of its definition at the end of the\ndialogue. Namely, as we will show, the passage is closely connected with the\nproblems studied at the end of the dialogue, but also to the two other parts of\nthe trilogy through the method of 'definition by division'. Finally, if our\nconclusions are different from the usual ones, it is probably because the\npassage is analyzed, maybe for the first time, simultaneously from the\nphilosophical, historical and mathematical points of view. It had been\nconsidered usually either as an excursus by historians of philosophy (for\ninstance [Burnyeat1978]), or as an isolated text separated from the rest of the\ndialogue by historians of mathematics (for instance [Knorr1975]), or lastly as\na pretext to discuss some astute developments in modern mathematics by\nmathematicians (for instance [Kahane1985]).[Brisson-Ofman1]: Luc\nBrisson-Salomon Ofman, `Theodorus' lesson in Plato's Theaetetus(147d3-d6)\nRevisited-A New Perspective', to appear[Brisson-Ofman2]: Luc Brisson-Salomon\nOfman, `The Philosophical Interpretation of Plato'sTheaetetus and the Final\nPart of the Mathematical Lesson (147d7-148b)', to appear[Burnyeat 1978]: Myles\nBurnyeat, `The Philosophical Sense of Theaetetus' Mathematics',Isis, 69, 1978,\n489-514[Kahane1985]: Jean-Pierre Kahane, `la th{\\'e}orie de Th{\\'e}odore des\ncorps quadratiques r{\\'e}els',L'enseignement math{\\'e}matique, 31, 1985, p.\n85-92[Knorr1975]: Wilbur Knorr, The evolution of the Euclidean elements,\nReidel, 1975[Ofman2014]: Salomon Ofman, `Comprendre les math{\\'e}matiques pour\ncomprendre Platon-Th{\\'e}{\\'e}t{\\`e}te (147d-148b)', Lato Sensu, I, 2014, p.\n70-80\n",

In this context it seemed natural to express\nthe translational curvature of his new spaces by a rotational quantity (via a\nkind of Grassmann dualization).

In the early 1930's two related unpublished results from\n1859 were found in Riemanns very rough notes by the great twentieth century\nmathematician and scholar, Carl Ludwig Siegel (1896-1981).\n  In his 1932 paper \"Uber Riemanns Nachlass zur analytischen Zahlentheorie\"(\"On\nRiemann's Nachlass for Analytic Number Theory\") Siegel presents these\nunpublished results and gives derivations he found in Riemann's notes. The\nfirst is an asymptotic development, now called the Riemann-Siegel formula, for\nefficiently computing values of the Riemann Zeta Function. The second is a new\nintegral representation of the zeta function. These results had not been\nrediscovered seventy years after Riemann. Thus, in 1932 the importance of\nSiegel's paper was not only its contribution to the history of mathematics, but\nalso its contribution to current research.\n  Hoping to get some insight into how Siegel spotted and deciphered these gems\namong Riemann's fragmentary and disordered personnel papers, we decided to look\nat the 1932 paper. We also wanted to learn how much of the paper is original to\nRiemann and whether Siegel needed to fill any gaps. Although Siegel's paper is\ncited whenever the Riemann-Siegel formula is discussed, we were unable the\nlocate an English translation. Despite our limited knowledge of the German\nlanguage, we have produced a translation of the paper as it appears in volume\none of Siegel's collected works.\n",

One often reads that it is equivalent to the notion\nof \\textit{polar,} a concept that emerged in the beginning of 19th century. In\nthis article we shall study in great detail the developments around that notion\nin the middle part of the \\textit{Brouillon project.} We shall in particular\nshow, using the notes added by Desargues after the first draft was written, how\nhere arises a new \\textit{theory,} that of the \\textit{polarity} associated to\na conic section. We shall show that besides a natural correspondance between\npoints and lines, Desargues has understood that a conic induces on every line\nin its plane an involution, and how he progressively handles the considerable\nconceptual difficulties he has to deal with when trying to explain clearly his\nnovative ideas.\n",

Each lighthouse\n\"illuminates\" facing towards the placement center with the same angle $\\alpha$,\nalso called \"Illumination Angle\" in this case. As for the light source itself,\nthere are two variations: a single point light source at the center of each\nlighthouse and point light sources on the arc seen by the illumination angle\nfor each lighthouse. The problem: what is the total dark (not illuminated) area\nfor a given number of lighthouses, and as the number of lighthouses approach\ninfinity? We show that by definition of the problem, neighbor lighthouses do\nnot overlap or be tangent to each other. We propose a solution for the center\npoint light source case and discuss several small cases of $n$ for the arc\nlight source case.\n",

There are good reasons for thinking that\nthis view should be rejected: it misrepresents both historical and current\nmathematical practice. Nonetheless, evidence, proof, and derivation are closely\nintertwined. This paper seeks to tease these concepts apart. It emphasizes the\nrole of argumentation as a context shared by evidence, proofs, and derivations.\nThe utility of argumentation theory, in general, and argumentation schemes, in\nparticular, as a methodology for the study of mathematical practice is thereby\ndemonstrated. Argumentation schemes represent an almost untapped resource for\nmathematics education. Notably, they provide a consistent treatment of rigorous\nand non-rigorous argumentation, thereby working to exhibit the continuity of\nreasoning in mathematics with reasoning in other areas. Moreover, since\nargumentation schemes are a comparatively mature methodology, there is a\nsubstantial body of existing work to draw upon, including some increasingly\nsophisticated software tools. Such tools have significant potential for the\nanalysis and evaluation of mathematical argumentation. The first four sections\nof the paper address the relationships of evidence to proof, proof to\nderivation, argument to proof, and argument to evidence, respectively. The\nfinal section directly addresses some of the educational implications of an\nargumentation scheme account of mathematical reasoning.\n",

At\nthat time, this was an open question since nobody knew whether Fermat's\nassertion was true. Euler had proved it for $n = 3$ and $n = 4$. However, no\none else had demonstrated the general case. Then Sophie Germain valiantly\nentered the world of mathematics in 1804, reaching out to Gauss (writing under\nthe assumed name Monsieur Le Blanc) boldly stating that she could do it.\nEventually, Germain conceived a formidable plan for proving Fermat's Last\nTheorem in its entirety, and in the process she obtained proofs of Case 1 for\nparticular families of exponents. Her efforts resulted in Sophie Germain's\nTheorem that proves Case 1 of FLT for an odd prime exponent $p$ whenever $2p +\n1$ is prime. Today, a prime $p$ is called a Sophie Germain prime if $2p + 1$ is\nalso prime. It remains an unanswered question whether there are an infinite\nnumber of Sophie Germain primes. But there is more that Germain did in number\ntheory, much of which was veiled by the mathematicians with whom she shared her\nwork. This article provides historical details of Sophie Germain's efforts,\nwritten with the sole intention of paying homage to the only woman\nmathematician who contributed to proving the most famous assertion of Fermat.\n",

The great French mathematician Henri Poincar\\'e\ncharacterised these anomalies as `monsters', a name that stuck. Secondly, the\ntwentieth-century philosopher Imre Lakatos composed a seminal work on the\nnature of mathematical proof, in which monsters play a conspicuous role.\nLakatos coined such terms as `monster-barring' and `monster-adjusting' to\ndescribe strategies for dealing with entities whose properties seem to falsify\na conjecture. Thirdly, and most recently, mathematicians dubbed the largest of\nthe sporadic groups `the Monster', because of its vast size and uncanny\nproperties, and because its existence was suspected long before it could be\nconfirmed.\n",

Using the analytic geometry and inversion\n(reflection) theorems, the center and radius of the inversion circle are\nobtained. Inside any one of the three given circles, a circle of the similar\nradius and concentric with its own corresponding original circle is drawn.The\ntangent circle to these three similar circles is obtained. Then the inverted\ncircles of the three similar circles and the tangent circle regarding an\nobtainable point and a computable power of inversion (reflection) constant are\nobtained. These circles (three inverted circles and an inverted tangent\ncircle)will be tangent together.Just,we obtain another reflection point and\npower of inversion so that those three reflected circles (inversions of three\nsimilar circles) can be reflections of three original circles, respectively. In\nsuch a case,the reflected circle tangent to three reflected circles regarding\nsame new inversion system will be tangent to the three original ones. This\ncircle is our desirable circle. A drawing algorithm is also given for drawing\ndesirable circle by straightedge and compass. A survey of conformal mapping\ntheory and inversion in higher dimensions is also accomplished. Although,\nLaguerre transformation might be used for solution of this problem, but we do\nnot make use of this method. Our novelty is just for drawing a circle tangent\nto three given circles applying a tangent circle to three identical circles\nconcentric with three given ones and then inverting them as original ones by\ncompass and straightedge not any thing else.\n",

I will consider the structure of mathematical\nlimit in Fregean arithmetics, calculus, and topology. I argue that a\ntopological approach to the concept of gramme creates a new \"limit\" that\nillustrates the map of our \"commute\" to the unknown, and therefore avoids the\naporetic act of crossing the impassible limit between life and death. This new\n\"limit,\" often referred to by mathematicians as a \"cone,\" is a shapeless shape\nthat offers us knowledge about time and space that we otherwise cannot know\nabout. By redefining the limit of time through three mathematical systems --\narithmetic, calculus, and topology -- this paper offers new perspectives to\ncouple mathematics with philosophy.\n",

On the other hand, every\nyear a great number of school students leave mathematics with total\ndisillusionment and bitterness, without ever witnessing any beauty in it. In\nthis work, we give some strategies to teach mathematics, especially to gifted\nstudents and to instill a love of mathematics in them. We will describe an\nintegrated approach to teaching mathematics where students are introduced to\nmore advanced, more elegant and more beautiful aspects of the subject early.\nThe proposed integrated approach takes advantage of the fascinating\ninterconnections between various subfields of mathematics, and even borrows\nfrom advanced topics such as number theory and topology. Combining the teaching\nof computer programming with the teaching of mathematics is another key focus\nof this work. This opens up the door to explore, not only the beautiful topics\nsuch as fractals, computer math art and computer graphics in general, but also\nreal-life applications resulting from computer simulations in engineering and\nphysics and other natural sciences. We will also discuss the use of\nstorytelling, explorations and experimenting, puzzles and creative problem\nsolving etc., to make learning interesting for students. It is important to\nshow students that the `true' essence of mathematics goes beyond the dry\nprocedural drill of learning arithmetic.

It could be considered as a follow-up\nof Chapter 1, where Ghislaine Gueudet situates the current state of DAD in\nlooking back to its origin: chapter 12 proposes a possible future of this\napproach in analyzing its current state. It determines the missing resources of\nDAD in questioning current and past PhD students who have anchored their\nresearch in DAD. What did/do they learn in using DAD as a main theoretical\nresource; to which extent did/do they estimate that they have enriched DAD by\ntheir own work? Which are, according to them, the still missing resources of\nDAD? Which of these resources should be developed by DAD from itself, and/or in\nco-working with other theoretical framework? From this inquiry, this chapter\nproposes ten perspectives of research, aiming to develop some theoretical blind\npoints of DAD, or to develop some methodological tools, or to deepen the\ncultural/social aspects of DAD in questioning the naming systems used by\nteachers when interacting with resources. This chapter echoes actually\ndifferent perspectives of research already present, as promising germs, in\nprevious chapters of the book.\n",

The pool of\nsignatories contains relatively more individuals inferred to be women and/or\nmembers of underrepresented ethnic groups. Moreover, this pool is diverse with\nrespect to the levels of professional security and types of academic\ninstitutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather,\nasks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of\nindividuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at\nhighly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically\nagainst diversity statements, calling them \"a mistake,\" and claiming that their\nusage during early stages of faculty hiring \"diminishes mathematical\nachievement.\" Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories\nwho both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly\ninferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities.

Intuitively, motivated proofs contain\nno \"puzzling\" steps, but they have received little further analysis. In this\npaper, I begin a philosophical investigation into motivated proofs.

I argue that motivated proofs promote understanding,\nconvey new mathematical resources and stimulate new discoveries.

In the same Memoir also appeared, five years before\nLaplace's contributions, what is usually called the Laplace limit constant.\nFurthermore, Carlini published other mathematical Memoirs anticipating, 70\nyears in advance, the importance of complex branches of the Lambert's special\nfunction.\n",

In that paper\nhe proposed a novel type of magic square, where in every row, column and\ndiagonal, if the entries are sorted in decreasing order, the difference between\nthe sum of entries with odd indices and those with even indices is constant. He\ncalled them \\emph{quadrata subtractionis}, meaning squares of subtraction. He\ngave examples of such squares of orders 4 and 5, and challenged readers to\nproduce an example of square of order 6. We discuss the likely method which he\nused to produce squares of order 5, and show that it can be generalized to\narbitrary odd orders. We also show how to construct doubly-even squares. At the\nend, we show an example of a square of order 6, sought by Kocha\\'nski, and\ndiscuss the enumeration of squares of subtraction.\n",

We estimate the time\nspent on an assignment by combining log file events into sessions of student\nactivity.

As an\napplication of these performance metrics, we contrast the behaviour of students\nwith WeBWorK scores less than 50% with the remainder of the class in a first\nyear Calculus course.

        "summary": "  Computer-based testing is an expanding use of technology offering advantages\nto teachers and students. We studied Calculus II classes for STEM majors using\ndifferent testing modes. Three sections with 324 students employed:\nPaper-and-pencil testing, computer-based testing, and both. Computer tests gave\nimmediate feedback, allowed multiple submissions, and pooling. Paper-and-pencil\ntests required work and explanation allowing inspection of high cognitive\ndemand tasks. Each test mode used the strength of its method. Students were\ngiven the same lecture by the same instructor on the same day and the same\nhomework assignments and due dates. The design is quasi-experimental, but\nstudents were not aware of the testing mode at registration. Two basic\nquestions examined were: (1) Do paper-and-pencil and computer-based tests\nmeasure knowledge and skill in STEM Calculus II in a consistent manner? (2) How\ndoes the knowledge and skill gained by students in a fully computer-based\nCalculus II class compare to students in a class requiring pencil-and-paper\ntests and hence some paper-and-pencil work. These results indicate that\ncomputer-based tests are as consistent with paper-and-pencil tests as\ncomputer-based tests are with themselves. Results are also consistent with\nclasses using paper-and-pencil tests having slightly better outcomes than fully\ncomputer-based classes using only computer assessments.\n",

We demonstrate that the Mesoamericans did not need to invent\npositional notation and discover zero at the same time because they were not\nafraid of using a number system in which the same number can be written in\ndifferent ways. A Long Count number system with digits from 0 to 20 is seen\nlater to pass to one using digits 0 to 19, which leads us to propose that even\nearlier there may have been an initial zeroless bijective numeration system\nwhose digits ran from 1 to 20. Mesoamerica was able to make this conceptual\nleap to the concept of a cardinal zero to perform arithmetic owing to a\nfamiliarity with multiple and redundant number representation systems.\n",

This is one of the main reasons that the enrollment of calculus\nclasses is consistently low. Lastly, a large portion of basic math classes are\ntaught by adjunct instructors, the turnover ratio among adjunct instructors is\nnot small. One such consequence is that many students don't have equitable\nlearning experiences and some students are still struggling with College\nAlgebra even in the calculus class.

        "summary": "  This article is the first part of a study of the so-called 'mathematical\npart' of Plato's Theaetetus (147d-148b). The subject of this 'mathematical\npart' is the irrationality, one of the most important topics in early Greek\nmathematics. As of huge interest for mathematicians, historians of mathematics\nas well as of philosophy, there had been an avalanche of studies about it. In\nour work, we revisit this question, for we think something is missing: a global\nanalysis of Plato's text, from these three points of view simultaneously:\nhistory, mathematics and philosophy. It is what we have undertook through a new\ntranslation, a new interpretation of the mathematical lesson about irrational\nmagnitudes and a novel interpretation of the whole passage from these three\npoints of view. Our guideline is considering Plato's writings seriously, not as\nsome playful work. This simple rule is indeed surprisingly constraining, but it\nallows us to get a rare direct glance inside pre-Euclidean mathematics, in\ncontradiction with the 'Main Standard Interpretation' prevailing in history of\nmathematics as well as in history of philosophy. This study had been divided in\ntwo parts for editorial reasons. In the present article, we propose an analysis\nof the first part of this 'mathematical part', Theodorus' lesson. In the second\narticle (Brisson-Ofman (to appear)), we present the sequel of the lesson and a\nphilosophical interpretation of the 'mathematical part' within the framework of\nthe entire dialogue. Both articles form a whole. They are both aimed to an\naudience without any particular mathematical background, and require only\nelementary mathematical knowledge, essentially of high school-level. Some more\ndelicate points are nevertheless developed in the Appendices.\n",

In\nthe present one, we consider the sequel and the end of the passage\n(147d7-148b2), as well as its philosophical interpretation in connection with\nthe whole dialogue. As in the previous article, we analyze it simultaneously\nfrom the mathematical, the historical and the philosophical points of view, a\nnecessity to understand it. Our strategy is once again to take seriously\nPlato's text, not as the dream of a poet. Our analysis casts a new light on\nthis passage, as an essential testimony for both Plato's philosophy and for\nhistory of mathematics. Plato's relation to Theodorus and Theaetetus is more\ncomplex than usually claimed; the search for a definition of knowledge\nconducted in a large part of the dialogue and even in some other dialogues is\nrooted in the mathematical passage; it needs a reevaluation of its connection\nto Euclid's Elements, in particular the proposition X.9, as well as a supposed\nEuclid's 'catastrophic' mistake (to quote Jean Itard) on incommensurability. In\na nutshell, the passage has to be understood differently than in the usual\ninterpretations gathered together under the collective so-called name 'Modern\nStandard Interpretation' (or MSI). Both articles form a whole. They are both\naimed to an audience without any particular mathematical background, and\nrequire only elementary mathematical knowledge, essentially of high\nschool-level.

This chapter examines a group of five tablets\ncontaining tables for surfaces of squares and rectangles dated to the Early\nDynastic period (ca. 2600-2350 BCE) and unearthed in southern Mesopotamia. In\norder to capture the methods used by ancient scribes to quantify surfaces,\nspecial attention is paid to the layout and organization of the tables, as well\nas to the way in which measurement values are written down. It is argued that\nthese methods vary according to the dimensions of the squares or rectangles\nconcerned: the quantification of small surfaces does not use the same\nmathematical tools as the quantification of large parcels of land. The chapter\nshows a reciprocal influence between the metrological systems adopted by the\nancient scribes and the methods of calculation of surface they implemented.\nSome methods may reflect ancient land-surveying practices, and others may\ntestify the emergence of new mathematical concepts applied to all kinds of\nsurfaces, large or small. Ultimately, several different conceptualizations of\nthe notion of surface emerge from the examination of these tables.\n",

Using a conjoint analysis method called Analytic Hierarchy Process from\nmathematician Thomas Saaty, this paper evaluates the relative influence certain\npredictors have on admissions into a mathematics PhD program. Additionally,\nthis paper analyzes the difference in factor rankings between varying\npopulations. For instance, results indicate that full professors tend to differ\nfrom their associate and assistant peers in their criteria rankings, and top 30\nmath PhD programs also differ in rankings when compared to programs outside the\ntop 30. It is my hope that the ordinal rankings and its subsequent analyses\nwill not only explain why some factors are valued more by the mathematics\ncommunity but also provide some guidance to potential graduate school\napplicants on where to dedicate their time as undergraduates\n",

We provide a mathematically rigorous and\naxiomatic presentation of angular measure that leads to the traditional way of\nmeasuring a plane angle subtended by a circular arc as the length of the arc\ndivided by the radius of the arc, a scalar quantity. We distinguish between the\n\\emph{angular magnitude}, defined in terms of congruence classes of angles, and\nthe (numerical) \\emph{angular measure} that can be assigned to each congruence\nclass in such a way that, e.g., the right angle has the numerical value\n$\\frac\\pi2$. We argue that angles are intrinsically different from lengths, as\nthere are angles of special significance (such as the right angle, or the\nstraight angle), while there is no distinguished length in Euclidean geometry.\nThis is further underlined by the observation that, while units such as the\nmetre and kilogram have been refined over time due to advances in metrology, no\nsuch refinement of the radian is conceivable. It is a mathematically defined\nunit, set in stone for eternity. We conclude that angular measures are numbers,\nand the current definition in SI should remain unaltered.\n",

The second is an activity about pentagons\nand pentagrams which aims at finding a more natural way of discovering their\nproperties than that suggested by Euclid as an illustration of the method of\nsynthesis and analysis. The third is an activity on circle inversion and its\nconnection with polarity and the construction of the fourth harmonic point\nafter three given point on a line. The activity continues with the reading of\nPoncelet's ideas about ideal secants of conics and how to use GeoGebra to make\nsense of them. The fourth activity shows how to use the possibility to move\nobjects in GeoGebra to make sense of the geometric intuition behind Cremona and\nHirst letters about the Bellavitis-Hirst inversion of a circle. We discuss the\nreasons why we believe that these kind of activities may help students to read\nand understand original writings in projective geometry and why we believe that\nthey may be very effective in the training of prospective teachers of\nmathematics.\n",

A\ndifferential equation that has only one independent variable is called an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE), and all derivatives in it are taken with\nrespect to that variable. Most often, the variable is time, t; although, I will\nuse x in this paper as the independent variable. The differential equation\nwhere the unknown function depends on two or more variables is referred to as\nPartial Differential Equations (PDE). Ordinary differential equations can be\nsolved by a variety of methods, analytical and numerical. Although there are\nmany analytic methods for finding the solution of differential equations, there\nexist quite a number of differential equations that cannot be solved\nanalytically [8]. This means that the solution cannot be expressed as the sum\nof a finite number of elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials,\ntrigonometric, and hyperbolic functions). For simple differential equations, it\nis possible to find closed form solutions [9]. But many differential equations\narising in applications are so complicated that it is sometimes impractical to\nhave solution formulas; or at least if a solution formula is available, it may\ninvolve integrals that can be calculated only by using a numerical quadrature\nformula. In either case, numerical methods provide a powerful alternative tool\nfor solving the differential equations under the prescribed initial condition\nor conditions [9]. In this paper, I present the basic and commonly used\nnumerical and analytical methods of solving ordinary differential equations.\n",

The life story of Ramanujan is so well known that it needs no\nelaboration not even a summarisation. In his short life period he made\nsubstantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite\nseries, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems\nthen considered unsolvable. Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900\nresults in the form of identities and equations. Many were completely novel;\nhis original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime,\nthe Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have\nopened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research.\nNearly all his claims have now been proven correct.\n  The focus of the paper is the increasing influence of the ideas propounded by\nRamanujan in the development of computing technology. We shall discuss the\napplication of certain infinite series discovered by Ramanujan in computing the\nvalue of the mathematical constant $\\pi$. We shall also consider certain\nspecial graphs known as Ramanujan graphs and the reason for designating them as\nsuch. We shall examine how certain researchers are attempting to create an\nabstract machine which they call Ramanujan machine which is thought of as\nsimulating the hypothesised thought process of Ramnujan.

The notion of angle is replaced\nby pseudo-angle, defined via the Minkowski inner product. Indeed, in Minkowski\nspace, the unit hyperbola is the set of points a unit metric distance from the\norigin, analogous to the Euclidean unit circle. While this is a result of pure\ngeometrical interest, the connection to Minkowski space allows an\ninterpretation in terms of special relativity where, in the limit $c\\to\\infty$,\nit leads to a familiar result from non-relativistic dynamics. This\nnon-relativistic result can be interpreted as an inscribed angle theorem for\nthe parabola, which we show can also be obtained from the Euclidean inscribed\nangle theorem by taking the limit of a family of ellipses ananlogous to the\nnon-relativistic limit $c\\to\\infty$. This simple result could be used as a\npedagogical example to consolidate understanding of pseudo-angles in\nnon-Euclidean spaces or to demonstrate the power of analytic continuation.\n",

We will follow this evolution from Steiner to the Neapolitan school\n(Trudi and Battaglini) and finally to the contribution of Beltrami that closed\nthis journey, at least from a mathematical point of view (scholars of\nelementary geometry, in fact, will continue to resume the problem from the\nsecond half of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century). We believe that\nsuch evolution may indicate the steady development of the mathematical methods\nfrom Euclidean metric to projective, and finally, with Beltrami, with the use\nof quadratic transformations. In this sense, the work of Beltrami appears\nsimilar to the recent (after the anticipations of Magnus and Steiner) results\nof Schiaparelli and Cremona. Moreover, Beltrami's methods are closely related\nto the study of birational transformations, which in the same period were\nbecoming one of the main topics of algebraic geometry. Finally, our work\nemphasises the role played by the ninepoint conic problem in the studies of\nyoung Beltrami who, under Cremona's guidance, was then developing his\nmathematical skills. To this end, we make considerable use of the unedited\ncorrespondence Beltrami-Cremona, preserved in the Istituto Mazziniano, Genoa.\n",

The system of axioms, together with\nits a priori interpretation, offers new views to philosophy and pedagogy of\nmathematics: (i) it supports the thesis that Euclidean geometry is a priori,\n(ii) it supports the thesis that in modern mathematics the Weyl's system of\naxioms is dominant to Euclid's system because it reflects the a priori\nunderlying symmetries, (iii) it gives a new and promising approach to learn\ngeometry which, through the Weyl's system of axioms, leads from the essential\ngeometric symmetry principles of the mathematical nature directly to modern\nmathematics.\n",

Its\nbasic tenet is that students acquire their own mathematical understanding by\nconstructing them from the inside rather than by internalizing them from the\noutside. Cognitive load theory, on the other hand, suggests that the free\nexploration of a highly complex environment may cause a heavy working memory\nload and led to poorer learning. Advocates of this view further argue that\nconstructivist strategies provide learners with information that exceeds their\nworking memory capacity, and thus fail to efficiently guide learners'\nacquisition of mathematical knowledge. The current study describes the elements\nof constructivism theory and their cognitive basis and show how they can be\naligned with the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture. More\nspecifically, we present several ways in which cognitive load can be managed by\nthese elements and so facilitate mathematical learning.\n",

The advocates of such a\nreading have lumped infinitesimals with infinite wholes, which are rejected by\nLeibniz as contradicting the part-whole principle. Far from supporting this\nreading, the letter is arguably consistent with the view that infinitesimals,\nas inassignable quantities, are mentis fictiones, i.e., (well-founded) fictions\nusable in mathematics, but possibly contrary to the Leibnizian principle of the\nharmony of things and not necessarily idealizing anything in rerum natura.\nUnlike infinite wholes, infinitesimals - as well as imaginary roots and other\nwell-founded fictions - may involve accidental (as opposed to absolute)\nimpossibilities, in accordance with the Leibnizian theories of knowledge and\nmodality.\n",

Like in Egypt also in Babylon\nsuch a value system can be shown. The reconstructed calculation sequence, of\nthe Plimpton 322 cuneiform tablet, presented and described here, shows in its\ncompleteness that, around 3800 years ago there already was a systematically\napplied exact measuring system, with the usage of trigonometric function\nvalues. With this approach one can plausibly explain that, as we still it\npractice today, a geometry of the circle has been used for this calculation. It\nis based on, but not only, of the usage of the regularities, which 1200 years\nlater, were named after Pythagoras. During a second calculation step, for an\nintended scaled documentation, presentation or transfer to other locations, the\ndimensionless calculated function value, was extended, with a fractional part,\nor more exact spelled a common factor. This transformation creates a real\nmeasurable length from the ratios, always related to the smallest unit. The\nsystematic usage by means of inclining triangles already in old Babylonian\ntimes, goes far beyond the previously known level of this age. The accuracy of\nthe individual calculation is just as verifiable and on exactly the same level\nas the trigonometric functions used today. However, at least at this point in\ntime, the Babylonians were content with dividing a quarter circle into at least\n150 inclining triangles. This old Babylonian trigonometric function value\nsystem, together with the here described \"Babylonian diagonal calculation\", is\nthus the forerunner of the Greek chord calculation and the Indo-Arabic\ntrigonometric functions of the early Middle Ages, which we still use today. In\naddition, the new approach to Plimpton 322 plausible explains why and how such\nvalues could have been used.\n",

The counting, number transcoding and\ncalculation skills of 274 children were assessed in the penultimate term of\npreschool (Mage=4:0). Prior to these assessments, parents completed\nquestionnaires that surveyed the frequency of the children's home learning\nexperiences. Three types of experiences were indexed: code-focused home\nliteracy experiences that focus on the phonological and orthographic features\nof language, meaning-focused home literacy experiences that focus on sharing\nthe meaning of language and text, and home number experiences. The children's\nlanguage abilities (phonological awareness and vocabulary) and nonverbal\nabilities (inhibitory control and nonverbal reasoning) were assessed in the\nfinal term of preschool (Mage=4:3). Their number skills were reassessed in the\nfinal term of the first year of primary school (Mage=5:3). Home letter-sound\ninteraction experiences (interactive code-focused literacy experiences) had\nsignificant longitudinal relationships with counting and number transcoding\nthat were independent of language and nonverbal abilities. The relationship\nbetween letter-sound interaction experiences and later counting was also\nindependent of the autoregressive influence of baseline counting ability. We\nextend previous findings by demonstrating that interactive code-focused home\nliteracy experiences in the preschool period predict growth in counting skills\neven when a broad range of language and cognitive abilities are controlled.\n",

Alternative models of WM have\nbeen proposed and a modality-dependent model of WM, distinguishing between\nverbal and visuospatial WM modalities, has been advanced. In addition, the\nrelationship between verbal and visuospatial WM and academic achievement has\nnot been extensively and consistently studied, especially when it comes to\ndistinguishing between mathematical and reading tasks. Method: In the present\nstudy, we tested a large group of middle school children in several measures of\nWM, and in mathematical and reading tasks. Results: Confirmatory factor\nanalyses showed that verbal and visuospatial WM can be differentiated and that\nthese factors have a different predictive power in explaining unique portions\nof variance in reading and mathematics. Conclusions: Our findings point to the\nimportance of distinguishing between WM modalities in evaluating the\nrelationship between mathematics and reading.\n",

In this paper, we offer a\ndescriptive theory of analogical reasoning in mathematics, stating general\nconditions under which an analogy may provide genuine inductive support to a\nmathematical conjecture (over and above fulfilling the merely heuristic role of\n'suggesting' a conjecture in the psychological sense). The proposed conditions\ngeneralize the criteria put forward by Hesse (1963) in her influential work on\nanalogical reasoning in the empirical sciences. By reference to several\ncase-studies, we argue that the account proposed in this paper does a better\njob in vindicating the use of analogical inference in mathematics than the\nprominent alternative defended by Bartha (2009). Moreover, our proposal offers\nnovel insights into the practice of extending to the infinite case mathematical\nproperties known to hold in finite domains.\n",

This\ninfluence can be traced, in particular, in Casorati's work on the\nfinite-difference calculus as conceived and published between 1879 and 1880\nwhen Pincherle was living in Pavia. Casorati's work has an interesting {\\it\nback story} related to his entry to the 1880 {\\it Grand Prix} of the French\n{\\it Acad\\'emie des Sciences} that helps us in understanding Casorati's\npersonality. Moreover, the correspondence that Casorati exchanged with other\nmathematicians on his work reveals that some of the results contained in\n[Casorati, 1880b] had been obtained -- though in a narrower context -- in an\nearly paper by Christoffel. Finally, the letters between Casorati and Pincherle\ncontain a short unpublished note by Pincherle on a paper by Jules Tannery\n[Tannery, 1875]. This note offers the first evidence of the influence of\n[Casorati, 1880b] on Pincherle's work on the finite-difference calculus.\n",

In this article, we offer a glimpse into the mathematical practice\nof the three leading exponents of the Italian School of algebraic geometry:\nCastelnuovo, Enriques, and Severi.

Unlike what is often assumed today, from\ntheir perspective, rigor is neither opposed to intuition nor understood as a\nunitary phenomenon - Enriques distinguishes between small-scale rigor and\nlarge-scale rigor and Severi between formal rigor and substantial rigor.\nFinally, we turn to the notion of mathematical objectivity. We draw from our\ncase study in order to advance a multi-dimensional analysis of objectivity.\nSpecifically, we suggest that various types of rigor may be associated with\ndifferent conceptions of objectivity: namely objectivity as faithfulness to\nfacts and objectivity as intersubjectivity.\n",

Recent literature in higher education overwhelmingly depicts this\nmode of instruction as inferior compared to the desired student-centered models\nbased on active learning techniques. First, using a four-quadrant model of\neducational environments, we address common confusion related to a conflation\nof two prevalent dichotomies by focusing on two key dimensions: (1) the extent\nto which students are prompted to engage actively and (2) the extent to which\nexpert explanations are provided. Second, using a case study, we describe an\nevolution of tertiary mathematics education, showing how traditional\ninstruction can still play a valuable role, provided it is suitably embedded in\na student-centered course design. We support our argument by analyzing the\nteaching practice and learning environment in a third-year abstract algebra\ncourse through the lens of Stanislav Dehaene's theoretical framework for\neffective teaching and learning. The framework, comprising \"four pillars of\nlearning\", is based on a state-of-the-art conception of how learning can be\nfacilitated according to cognitive science, educational psychology, and\nneuroscience findings. In the case study, we illustrate how, over time, the\nunit design and the teaching approach have evolved into a learning environment\nthat aligns with the four pillars of learning. We conclude that traditional\nlectures can and do evolve to optimize learning environments and that the\nerection of the dichotomy \"traditional instruction versus active learning\" is\nno longer relevant.\n",

The Inquiry-Based Mathematics\nEducation (IBME) movement has gained strong momentum among some mathematicians,\nattracting substantial funding, including from some US government agencies.\nThis resulted in the successful mobilization of regional consortia in many\nstates, uniting over 800 mathematics education practitioners working to reform\nundergraduate education. Inquiry-based learning is characterized by the\nfundamental premise that learners should be allowed to learn 'new to them'\nmathematics without being taught. This progressive idea is based on the\nassumption that it is best to advance learners to the level of experts by\nengaging learners in mathematical practices similar to those of practising\nmathematicians: creating new definitions, conjectures and proofs - that way\nlearners are thought to develop 'deep mathematical understanding'. However,\nconcerted efforts to radically reform mathematics education must be\nsystematically scrutinized in view of available evidence and theoretical\nadvances in the learning sciences. To that end, this scoping review sought to\nconsolidate the extant research literature from cognitive science and\neducational psychology, offering a critical commentary on the effectiveness of\ninquiry-based learning. Our analysis of research articles and books pertaining\nto the topic revealed that the call for a major reform by the IBME advocates is\nnot justified. Specifically, the general claim that students would learn better\n(and acquire superior conceptual understanding) if they were not taught is not\nsupported by evidence.

They were less successful in giving tentative\nexplanations of what convinced the Egyptians of its correctness. In particular,\nthey never looked into the possibility of dissecting three identical copies of\nthe frustum and recomposing them into three boxes of differing sizes whose\nvolumes can be easily calculated. This is surprising because the formula at\nwhich the historians arrived seems to suggest this procedure. About 2000 years\nafter the Egyptians, the Chinese scholar Liu Hui did exactly this for the\nalmost identical problem from the Nine Chapters. If those historians of\nmathematics around 1930 had known Liu Hui's algorithm they could have easily\ndrawn tentative conclusions also for the Egyptian case. The present paper\nsuggests that it was their knowledge of rigorous Euclidean geometry and of\nrelatively modern algebra which distorted the judgment of those historians,\nsomething which could not have been the case for Liu Hui. Their failure seems\nto have discouraged later Egyptologists to look for explanations or to even\npoint to Liu Hui when his work had become known. Thus a chance was missed to\nuse the great intuitive and pedagogic potential of a remarkable piece of\nEgyptian mathematics. This paper is not a contribution to the historiography of\nEgyptian mathematics for which the author is no specialist but argues primarily\non a methodological level using secondary historical sources. The paper is\npartly inspired by a more recent publication of Paul Shutler (2009) who\nsuggests an intuitive and historically possible proof also for the special, and\nmathematically crucial case of the second formula, which is related to the full\npyramid.\n",

Prior studies have shown that there exists a forced\nwinning strategy for the first player, whereby they can win in at least 29\nmoves and at most 43 moves. This paper proposes a practical solution to the\nforced-win problem discovered by Bertholon et al., by putting forth a simple\nmethod for randomizing the first set of moves that are played. This method uses\n5 randomly generated digits between 0 and 8 to arbitrarily place the first 4\nmoves of the game, and helps players avoid forced wins without having to change\nother rules of the game. This paper also investigates the probability that a\nrandom placement of the first 4 moves will lead to an easily calculable forced\nwin, and shows that this probability is precisely 56/59049, or 0.0948%.\n",

In\nthe usual approach to the problem, network resistance is ignored and simplified\npower-angle relations are used based on branch reactances alone. The purpose of\nthis note is to describe a tractable generalisation of this approach to account\nfor arbitrary network resistances. The solution is worked in detail for a\nsingle network branch with resistance $R \\geq 0$ and reactance $X > 0$, with\nexplicit formulae derived linking branch impedance, active and reactive power\nflows, voltage phase displacement and losses under the 'flat' voltage profile\nassumption. These formulae have a convenient expression in terms of a\n'coefficient of support' which relates the assumed active power flow to the\ncorresponding reactive power consumed on the branch, and encapsulates much of\nthe mathematical technicalities in the exact solution. It is shown that when\nnetwork resistance is taken into account, the angle displacement $\\delta_j -\n\\delta_k$ between adjacent bus voltages is always larger than given by the\nlossless power-angle relation $\\sin(\\delta_j - \\delta_k) = XP$. The approach is\napplied to the analysis of circulating power flows in large networks, building\non the classic work of Janssens and Kamagate (2003). It is seen that in\nnetworks with nonzero branch resistances, a circulating flow of active power is\nalways accompanied by a counter-circulating flow of reactive power.\n",

It is an algebra with symbols but\nwithout numbers, in which the covariation between geometric variables,\nconstrained by ruler and compass constructions or with other geometric\nconstructions, can be expressed with symbolic equations. By using algebraic\nmanipulations, it is possible to easily deduce the properties of the\ncorresponding geometric constructions, including those that produce graphs of\nrational functions. We believe that the study of functions through Descartes's\nalgebra can be didactically effective in teaching and learning the concept of\nfunction in secondary school. Firstly, it avoids the reference to real numbers;\nsecondly, the interpretation of formulas as geometric constructions and vice\nversa facilitates the \"transition\" from functions understood as processes to\nfunctions understood as objects.\n",

In France, somepreeminent geographers were not convinced by\nNewton's arguments, and about the same period, based on empirical measurements,\nthey emitted another theory, claiming that on the contrary, the Earth has the\nform of a spheroid flattened at the equator and elongated at the poles. To find\nthe real figure of the Earth became one of the major questions that were\ninvestigated by geographers, astronomers, mathematicians and other scientists\nin the eighteenth century, and the work done around this question had an impact\non the development of all these fields. In this paper, we review the work of\nthe eighteenth-century French mathematician, astronomer and geographer\nAlexis-Claude Clairaut related to the question of the figure of the Earth. We\nreport on the relation between this work and that of Leonhard Euler. At the\nsame time, we comment on the impact of the question of the figure of the Earth\non mathematics, astronomy and hydrostatics. Finally, we review some later\nmathematical developments that are due to various authors that were motivated\nby this question. It is interesting to see how a question on geography had such\nan impact on the theoretical sciences.

A Young diagram is a visual\nrepresentation of a partition using rows of boxes, where each row of boxes\ncorresponds to a part. The conjugate partition is similar to a transpose of a\nmatrix; we switch the rows with columns, or the index of a part with the part\nitself. Self-conjugate partitions are partitions that are equal to their\nconjugate; previously, the only known way to verify whether a partition is\nself-conjugate was through the use of a Young diagram. In this research, by\nproving preliminary lemmas and theorems about easily identifiable shapes which\nare symmetric, we come to the main result: by simply adding the multiplicities\nof parts appropriately, we can show whether or not a partition is\nself-conjugate without the use of a Young diagram.\n",

We demonstrate this idea by\nlooking at original paintings from the Renaissance, and by carrying out the\nexplicit analytic calculations that underpin those masterpieces.\n",

To this end,\nwe consider categorical groupoids, where colors (timbres) are objects and color\nvariations (timbre variations) are morphisms, and functors between them, which\nare induced by continuous maps.

There exist many mathematical proofs, but they tend to involve several\nanalytical steps or geometrical constructions, making them unintuitive and hard\nto understand. Here, a simpler explanation is presented which only requires\nfollowing the paths of light rays, and examining local paths that move from one\npoint on a conic to a nearby one. First, a light-ray is followed as it runs\nalong one of the legs of an isosceles triangle, and then reflects off a mirror\nthat is parallel to the triangle's base. It bounces back along the path of the\ntriangle's other leg. Next, a path is examined, moving from an arbitrary point\non a conic section curve to a nearby point on the same curve. This path\nconsists of two equal-length straight line steps, with each step following one\nof the constraints that defines the curve. For example, on an ellipse, defined\nby the sum of the distances to the two foci remaining constant, the path starts\nat a point on the ellipse, moves a distance delta directly away from one focus,\nthen makes a second equal-length step directly towards the second focus. These\ntwo steps form the legs of precisely the sort of isosceles triangle described\nabove, with its base running along the path of the curve. A light ray following\nthe legs of that triangle gets reflected directly from one focus to the other.\nAs the triangle shrinks towards zero, the reflection point converges onto the\nactual curve. Exactly the same argument also explains the reflections of\nparabolas and hyperbolas. Surprisingly, this explanation does not seem to have\nappeared previously in the long history of writings about conics. It is hoped\nthat it will help to make the reflective properties of conic sections easier to\nunderstand and to explain.\n",

Too often, a\nnarrower definition of who is considered a mathematician (and what is\nconsidered mathematics) is used to exclude people from the discipline -- both\nexplicitly and implicitly. However, using a narrow definition of a\nmathematician allows us to examine and challenge systemic barriers that exist\nin certain spaces of the community. This paper explores and illuminates\ntensions between narrow and broad definitions and how they can be used to\npromote both inclusion and exclusion simultaneously. In this article, we\npresent a framework of definitions based on identity, function, and\nqualification and exploring several different meanings of ``mathematician\". By\ninterrogating various definitions, we highlight their risks and opportunities,\nwith an emphasis on implications for broadening and/or narrowing participation\nof underrepresented groups.\n",

Contrary to the belief that these authors\nare merely stating variations of the famous Thabit ibn Qurra's (d. 901) rule in\ndifferent manners, we show that their statements are different.

The research involved 171 ninth-grade students\nfrom the author's school and was divided into two experimental groups (A and B)\nand a control group (C). The study aimed to improve students' mathematical\ncomputation ability through algorithm analysis and comparison. The results\nshowed that after a long period of practice, there was an improvement in\nstudents' computational ability, and most students could reach the level of\nhigh school mathematical computation ability. However, further research is\nneeded to determine how to achieve level three of mathematical computation\nability.\n  The study found that students' computational ability levels were similar in\nthe experimental and control groups at the beginning of the study. Through\ntargeted discussion courses, students' computational ability levels were\nimproved. The degree of improvement was not significantly related to students'\ngender but had a moderate positive correlation with the number of times\nstudents participated in related discussions.\n  Based on the practical results, the author proposes several suggestions to\nhelp teachers improve students' mathematical computation ability. Firstly,\nstudents' interest in learning computation can be stimulated by arousing their\ncuriosity, using typical problems to motivate their interest, and encouraging\ntheir participation. Secondly, teachers should pay more attention to selecting\ntypical problems to help students better understand computational logic.\nLastly, in addition to understanding computational logic, teachers should also\nfocus on developing students' mathematical thinking quality, enabling students\nto select optimal computational strategies and improve their algorithm\nselection abilities.\n",

The target is undergraduate (adult) learners but these LOs can be\nadapted for earlier and later stages of learning. Core contents of Ethical\nReasoning are: 1. its six constituent knowledge, skills, and abilities; 2. a\nstakeholder analysis; and 3. ethical practice standards or guidelines. These\nare briefly summarized. Five LOs are articulated at each of three levels of\ncognitive complexity (low/med/high), and a set of assignment features that can\nbe adapted repeatedly over a term are given supporting these LOs. These\nfeatures can support authentic development of the knowledge, skills, and\nabilities that are the target of ethical reasoning instruction in math and\nquantitative courses at the tertiary level. Three contexts by which these can\nbe integrated are Assumption (what if the assumption fails?), Approximation\n(what if the approximation does not hold?), and Application (is the application\nappropriate? what if it is not?). One or more of the three core contents of\nEthical Reasoning can be added to any problem already utilized in a course (or\nnew ones) by asking learners to apply the core to the context. Engagement with\nethical reasoning can prepare students to assume their responsibilities to\npromote and perpetuate the integrity of their profession across their careers\nusing mathematics, statistics, data science, and other quantitative methods and\ntechnologies.\n",

In considering women across all social classes, it argues for a\nbroad definition of 'mathematics' that includes arithmetic and astronomy, and\nassesses women's opportunities for engagement under three headings: education,\nfamily, and sociability. It concludes that certain elements of Scottish\nEnlightenment culture promoted wider participation by women in mathematical\nactivities than has previously been recognized, but that such participation\ncontinued to be circumscribed by societal views of the role of women within\nfamily formation.\n",

We use the term illustration to encompass any way one might bring a\nmathematical idea into physical form or experience, including hand-made\ndiagrams or models, computer visualization, 3D printing, and virtual reality,\namong many others. The very process of illustration itself challenges our\nmathematical understanding and forces us to answer questions we may not have\nposed otherwise. It can even make mathematics an experimental science, in which\nimmersive exploration of data and representations drive the cycle of problem,\nconjecture, and proof. Today, modern technology for the first time places the\nproduction of highly complicated models within the reach of many individual\nmathematicians. Here, we sketch the rich history of illustration, highlight\nimportant recent examples of its contribution to research, and examine how it\ncan be viewed as a discipline in its own right.\n",

While formal logic is certainly necessary for a complete\nunderstanding of mathematical practice, it is not sufficient. Important aspects\nof mathematical reasoning closely resemble patterns of reasoning in\nnonmathematical domains. Hence the tools developed to understand informal\nreasoning, collectively known as argumentation theory, are also applicable to\nmuch mathematical argumentation. This chapter investigates some of the details\nof that application. Consideration is given to the many contrasting meanings of\nthe word ``argument''; to some of the specific argumentation-theoretic tools\nthat have been applied to mathematics, notably Toulmin layouts and\nargumentation schemes; to some of the different ways that argumentation is\nimplicated in mathematical practices; and to the social aspects of mathematical\nargumentation.\n",

Light effects and\nmovements of virtual objects are computed on the basis of triangulations.\nBesides computer graphics, triangulated surfaces are used for the simulations\nof physical processes, like heating or cooling of objects or deformations. The\nnumerical method for these simulations is often the finite element method,\nwhose accuracy depends on the quality of the triangulation. The quality of a\ntriangle is generally determined by computing its proximity to an equilateral\ntriangle. Namely, the triangle's inner angles should neither be too small nor\ntoo big in order to obtain reliable numerical results. Therefore, one often\nimproves the mesh quality before any simulation. The fact that we require\ntriangulations for accurate simulations is the main motivation for our\noccupation with triangle transformations. We need a triangulation method that\ntransforms each triangle into a more regular one. However, the transformation\nshould not regularize a particular triangle too fast as this may inhibit that\nthe regularity a neighboring triangles can achieve. At the same time, we would\nlike to prove the efficacy of the transformation. a property often missed by\nthe heuristic procedures used in practice. Besides the practical motivation,\nthe transformation itself exhibits interesting properties which can nicely be\nproved by basic mathematics.\n",

First, Kummer's concept of\n''ideal prime factors of a complex number'' was inspired by Poncelet's\nintroduction of ideal elements in geometry as well as by the\nreconceptualization that Michel Chasles put forward for them in 1837. In other\nwords, the idea of ideal divisors in Kummer's ''theory of complex numbers''\nderives from the introduction of ideal elements in the new geometry. This is\nwhere the term ''ideal'' comes from. Second, the introduction of ideal elements\ninto geometry and the subsequent reconceptualization of what was in play with\nthese elements were linked to philosophical reflections on generality that\npractitioners of geometry in France developed in the first half of the\n19${}^{\\rm th}$ century in order to devise a new approach to geometry, which\nwould eventually become projective geometry. These philosophical reflections\ncirculated as such and played a key part in the advance of other domains,\nincluding in Kummer's major innovation in the context of number theory.\n",

Some mathematicians, such as Euclid and Cantor,\nheld the position that a line is composed of points, while others, like\nAristotle, Weyl and Brouwer, argued that a line is not composed of points but\nrather a matrix of a continued insertion of points. In spite of this\ndisagreement on the structure of the continuum, they did distinguish the\ntemporal line from the spatial line. In this paper, we argue that there is\nindeed a difference between the intuition of the spatial continuum and the\nintuition of the temporal continuum. The main primary aspect of the temporal\ncontinuum, in contrast with the spatial continuum, is the notion of\norientation.\n  The continuum has usually been mathematically modeled by Cauchy sequences and\nthe Dedekind cuts. While in the first model, each point can be approximated by\nrational numbers, in the second one, that is not possible constructively. We\nargue that points on the temporal continuum cannot be approximated by rationals\nas a temporal point is a flow that sinks to the past. In our model, the\ncontinuum is a collection of constructive Dedekind cuts, and we define two\ntopologies for temporal continuum: 1. oriented topology and 2. the ordinary\ntopology. We prove that every total function from the oriented topological\nspace to the ordinary one is continuous.\n",

Finally, we will show that Euler's ideas on continued\nfractions lead to an integral representation for the Legendre polynomials that\nseems to be less generally known.\n",

In standard 5-card poker, the order from most common to least\ncommon is straight, flush, full house. The same order is true for 7-card poker\nsuch as Texas hold'em. However, is the same true for n-card poker for larger n?\nWe study the probability of obtaining these various hands for n-card poker for\nvarious values of $n\\geq 5$. In particular, we derive equations for the\nprobability of flush, straight and full house and show that the probability of\nflush is less than a straight when $n\\leq 11$, and is more than a straight when\nn>11. Similarly, we show that the probability of full house is less than a\nstraight when $n\\leq 19$, and is more than a straight when n>19. This means\nthat for games such as Big Two where the ordering of 13-card hands depends on\nthe ordering in 5-card poker, the ranking ordering does not follow the\noccurrence probability ordering, contrary to what intuition suggests.\n",

Using a machine\nlearning algorithm of the support vector machine (SVM) classification, we\ninvestigated whether there are observable variations in the survey response\nwhen stratified by gender difference. We seek a hyperplane that best divides\nthis dataset into two distinct classes based on gender differences. After\nimplementing the principal component analysis (PCA) for reducing the data\ndimensionality, we observed that there exists a discernible hyperplane that\nsegregates the responses based on gender difference. This implies that SVM has\nlearned to capture and represent the underlying gender-related characteristics\nwithin the dataset.

The construction of a\nteaching-learning project, as part of a collaborative effort with the class\nteacher, a priori helps students to overcome the main difficulties inherent in\nconceptualizing the local approximation objects of a function in the first year\nof preparatory classes. In the case of the design and implementation of\ndidactic development engineering, analysis of the reasoning produced by\nstudents confronted with a situation with an adidactic dimension will enable us\na priori to study the nature and origin of these difficulties. Our methodology\nfor analyzing student work is based on a model of reasoning analysis within the\nframework of the theory of didactic situations mathematics. This model has\nplayed an essential role in the development of didactic engineering, in the\nidentification of students' conceptions, forms and functions of reasoning. It\nalso enabled us to identify epistemological, didactic and cultural obstacles to\nlearning the concept of local approximation of a function. These obstacles\nresult either from the paradigm shift that takes place during the transition\nfrom secondary to higher education, or from working within the paradigm of\nInfinitesimal Analysis during the appropriation of this mathematical concept.\n",

On the contrary, we show that\nsycategorematicity, as a traditional idea of classical scholasticism, is a\nfeature of young Leibniz's thinking, from which he moves away in order to solve\nthe same problem, as he gains mathematical knowledge.\n  We have divided Leibniz's path toward his mature view of infinitesimals into\nfive phases, which are especially significant for reconstructing the entire\nevolution. In our reconstruction, an important role is played by Leibniz's text\nDe Quadratura Arithmetica. Based on this and other texts we dispute the thesis\nthat fictionality coincides with syncategorematicity, and that unassignability\ncan be bypassed. On the contrary, we maintain that unassignability, as\nincompatible with the principle of harmony, is the ultimate reason for the\nfictionality of infinitesimals.\n",

More specifically, we write the entries of the Chebyshev matrices\n$ T$ and $ U$ in terms of binomial coefficients. We remark that the inverses of\ncertain submatrices of the Chebyshev matrix $ T$ correspond to classical power\nreduction formulas for trigonometric functions. Therefore the entries of $\nT^{-1}$ are expressible in terms of binomial coefficients and powers of two.\nThe inverses of certain submatrices of the Chebyshev matrix $ U$ appear in\npower reduction formulas involving the Catalan triangles. We could not spot\nthem in the literature. As a corollary the Catalan triangles are interpreted as\ninverses of rather natural matrices of binomial coefficients. We explain the\nmatrix inversions in terms of Riordan arrays. We solve the integral $ \\int\n_{0}^{2\\pi }\\cos^{2m}( x)\\sin^{2n}( x) dx$ and deduce a hypergeometric identity\nfrom the Fourier expansion of $\\cos^{2m}(x)$ and $ \\sin^{2n}( x)$. As a\ncorollary we prove that super Catalan numbers are integers. We emphasize that\nfrom the point of view of these base changes between the trigonometric\npolynomials it is more natural to work with $2\\cos(x)$ and $2\\sin(x)$ instead\nof $\\cos(x)$ and $\\sin(x)$, since the transition matrices become invertible\nover the integers. We do a similar analysis for the spread polynomials. This\nenables us to make a conjecture of Goh and Wildberger more precise. In this\nexposition we give a mostly self-contained account of the matter, the\nprerequisites just being four semesters of calculus, linear algebra, elementary\ncomplex variables and the residue theorem.\n",

On this\nbasis Bolyai developed a non-Euclidean geometry nowadays called hyperbolic\ngeometry.\n  The English translation of Bolyai's text is reprinted in the paper, with\nexplanatory notes provided at the end of each section. Some of the theorems are\ndiscussed in detail, with a particular focus on those in which Bolyai derived\nthe trigonometric identities of the hyperbolic plane and on his astonishing\nquadrature of the circle. Bolyai's terse style of exposition can be quite\nchallenging, so I have tried to fill in some of the mathematical details which\nhe chose to omit, either through lack of space or simply because he thought\nthem to obvious too include.\n",

They begin by discussing huge (but still describable)\nfinite numbers, then they proceed to the concepts of fixed points, Cantor's\ncountably infinite ordinals, transfinite cardinals and the continuum\nhypothesis, and then to more recent attempts to define still-larger infinities\ncalled large cardinals. I should warn the reader that the author is an\nastrophysicist, so these pedagogic explanations may not be satisfying (or\nanywhere nearly sufficiently rigorous) to a mathematician. Still, I hope these\nexplanations provide some intuitive insights about concepts that are too large\nto fit in the physical universe.\n",

Considering the Weierstrass product for the Jacobi\ntheta function $\\vartheta_1$ and taking quarter of the factors (corresponding\nto the positive quadrant in the lattice $n_1\\omega+n_2\\omega_2$ of periods), we\ncome to the double gamma function. It satisfies big collection of identities\nparallel to properties of $\\Gamma(x)$. We discuss the seminal work (1888-89) by\nV.P.Alekseevsky, where the double gamma function was introduced and\ninvestigated. His standpoint was the paper by P.\\'E.Appell (1881) on extensions\nof Heine's $q$-version of the Euler gamma function. For the case of equal\nperiods $\\omega_1=\\omega_2$, a function equivalent to the double gamma function\nwas introduced earlier by H.Kinkelin (1860). After Alekseevsky, the double\ngamma function was a topic of investigations by E.W.Barnes, J.Beaupin,\nG.H.Hardy, V.A.Steklov in 1899-1907. It was quite unusual compared to special\nfunctions known at that time. Despite obviously bright publications, the\nfunction was forgotten until 1976-1979, when it appeared again in works by\nT.Shintani and M.V.Vign\\'eras. In the same time, Shintani introduced the double\nsine as a product of two double gammas. We also discuss the biography of\nAlekseevsky (1858-1916).\n",

The publication of these\ntexts raises the question of the nature of these signs and the economy of\nimplicit relationships between their various components. Peirce's semiological\napproach provides the philosophical ground for these reflections, while Michel\nSerres's structuralism is a fertile source of inspiration. The digital tool\nholds much promise for many issues, including the particular difficulties of\ntables. We will show that it can be implemented by different computer\nstructures which largely determine the way the historian conceives them a\npriori but also the way the reader receives them a posteriori. Finally, the\ntables are the simple case that founds a general problematic on the\ninterpretation of many manuscripts and allows us to study the problem of the\nwriting process at its root.\n",

For the second purpose, we have collected together\nthe original Sanskrit verses describing the correction terms, their English\ntranslations and their presentations in modern notations. The Kerala rationale\nfor these correction terms are also critically examined. The general conclusion\nin this regard is that, even though the correction terms give high precision\napproximations to the value of $\\pi$, the rationale presented by Kerala authors\nis not strong enough to convince modern mathematical scholarship.\n  The author has extended M\\=adhava's results by presenting higher order\ncorrection terms which yield better approximations to $\\pi$ than the correction\nterms attributed to M\\=adhava. The various infinite series representations of\n$\\pi$ obtained by M\\=adhava and his disciples from the basic M\\=adhava-Leibniz\nseries using M\\=adhava's correction terms are also discussed. A few more such\nseries representations using the better correction terms developed by the\nauthor are also presented.

Calvin accommodated Epicurean chance with Stoic determinism and\nsynthesised \\emph{phronesis/prudentia}, founded personal experience and\nemployed to deal with \\emph{tyche/fortuna}, and \\emph{episteme/scientia},\nuniversal knowledge. This meant that matters of chance, which had previously\nbeen considered too particular for mathematical treatment, became part of\n\\emph{episteme/scientia}. Clear evidence of the significance of Calvin in\nmathematics is in the facts that Huygens considered using the word 'hope' to\ndescribe mathematical expectation and French mathematics still uses\n\\emph{esp\\'erance} for mathematical expectation. Calvin asserted that Hope\nrepresented a universal, objective and indubitable idea making it\ncharacteristic of mathematics. The argument is built on a review of how the\nideas of Hope, Faith and Prudence have evolved in European thought that\nhighlights Calvin's innovations. The conclusion identifies contemporary issues\nin the application of mathematics in society that are illuminated in light of\nCalvin's doctrine.\n",

The basic question has been whether the infinite exists only in\npotential or exists in actuality. Only at the end of the 19th century, a set\ntheory was created that works with the actual infinite. Initially, this theory\nwas rejected by other mathematicians. The creator behind the theory, the German\nmathematician Georg Cantor, felt all the more the need to challenge the long\ntradition that only recognised the potential infinite. In this, he received\nstrong support from the interest among German neothomist philosophers, who,\nunder the influence of the Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII, Aeterni Patris, began\nto take an interest in Cantor's work. Gradually, his theory even acquired\napproval from the Vatican theologians. Cantor was able to firmly defend his\nwork and at the turn of the 20th century, he succeeded in gaining its\nacceptance. The storm that had accompanied its original rejection now\naccompanied its acceptance. The theory became the basis on which modern\nmathematics was and is still founded, even though the majority of\nmathematicians know nothing of its original theological justification. Set\ntheory, which today rests on an axiomatic foundation, no longer poses the\nquestion of the existence of actual infinite sets. The answer is expressed in\nits basic axiom: natural numbers form an infinite set. No substantiation has\nbeen discovered other than Cantor's: the set of all natural numbers exists from\neternity as an idea in God's intellect.\n",

The paper turns then to Weyl's\nremarks on Noether's work, and argues against assimilating her use of the\naxiomatic method in algebra to his late view on axiomatics, on the ground of\nthe latter's resistance to Noether's principle of detachment.\n",

For example, the rabbinical school of\nBeit Hillel says that one boy and one girl are necessary, whereas Beit Shammai\nurges for two boys. Surprisingly enough, although the corresponding average\nfamily sizes differ in both cases, the gender ratios remain constant. We show\nmore that for any family planning rule the gender ratio is equal to the birth\nodds. The proof of this result is given by using different mathematical\ntechniques, such as induction principle, Doob's optional-stopping theorem, and\nbrute-force. We conclude that, despite possible asymmetries in the religiously\nmotivated family planning rules, they discriminate neither boys nor girls.\n",

It is part of the folklore of mathematics\nthat the genesis of this argument was motivated by physical analogy involving\nelectrostatic fields. The story goes something like this: If an electrostatic\npotential is prescribed on the boundary of a region, it will extend to a\npotential in the interior of the region which is harmonic when the electric\nfield is in stable equilibrium, and that electrostatic field has minimum\nDirichlet energy. The details of this argument are seldom given and where they\nare, they are typically scant, redacted, and speculative while often omitting\neither physics details or mathematics details. The purpose of this article is\nto give a detailed reconstruction of the electrostatic argument by combining\naccounts in several contemporary and historical disparate sources.

We\nprecisely define morphisms, distinguish between dynamic morphisms (on\noperations, binary relations) and static ones (on $n$-ary relations), and\ndescribe how a flexible and pluralistic use of morphisms can serve as a general\nframework for understanding and explanation in a wide variety of fields.\n",

Four\ndifferent approaches are discussed all of which are found in Nilakantha\nSomayaji's (1444 - 1545 CE) Tantrasangraha and the roots of all of which can be\ntraced to ideas originally articulated by Sangamagrama Madhava (c. 1340 - 1425\nCE): (i) a simple method when the argument is small; (ii) an iterative method\nwhen the argument is small; (iii) a method based on a lookup table; (iv) a\nmethod when the argument is large. The paper also contains the original\nSanskrit verses describing the various methods and English translations\nthereof. Moreover, there is a presentation of a novel method for computing the\ncircumference of a circle found in Jyeshthadeva's (c. 1500 - 1575 CE)\nYuktibhasha which is based on method (i) for computing the arcsin function. All\nmethods have been illustrated with numerical examples. A surprising by-product\nof the investigation is a totally unexpected appearance of a core integer\nsequence, namely, the entry A001764 in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer\nSequence, while studying the iterative method for computing the arcsin\nfunction.\n",

Since the first mathematical stamps appeared in the\nearly 20th century, featuring prominent scholars like Carl Friedrich Gauss and\nIsaac Newton, they serve not only as philatelic artifacts but also as\nhistorical carriers of knowledge. The paper presents several practical projects\nto interest students, such as creating their own math stamps, investigating the\nprice trends of math-themed stamps, and developing a timeline of mathematical\ndiscoveries depicted in philatelic issues. The proposed projects develop\nstudents' mathematical skills in areas such as percentage calculations, general\narithmetic, working with time intervals, and statistical analysis. Students can\nanalyze shapes, symmetry, and patterns on stamps, study principles of\nproportion, and explore geometric figures. Using stamps broadens students'\nhorizons, providing an opportunity to become familiar with renowned\nmathematicians from different eras, countries, and cultures. This also offers\nstudents a new perspective on the subject, presenting mathematical discoveries\nas part of the world's cultural heritage. Postage stamps dedicated to\nmathematics can become a powerful tool for visualizing theoretical knowledge,\nstimulating interest in mathematics, and encouraging independent research among\nstudents.\n",

By the way the\ninteractive game theoretical aspects of interpretational geometries are\nclarified.\n",

First, because there are very elegant and\ndifficult questions in it. Second, because some of the greatest figures in\nmathematics so far had spent time working on problems in number theory. In\nparticular, Descartes spent time looking for (and finding) a pair of amicable\nnumbers that previously in Europe had been unknown. Euler also mentions the\nwork of Frans van Schooten. Then Euler explains the form of the amicable\nnumbers that were then known, which were $2^n xy$ and $2^n z$, where $x,y,z$\nare prime, and the two conditions i) $z=xy+x+y$ and ii) $2^n(x+y+2)=xy+x+y+1$\nare satisfied. Euler says that to find more amicable numbers different forms\nshould be tried. He gives 30 pairs of amicable numbers but does not explain how\nhe found them. This is discussed in Ed Sandifer's November 2005 \"How Euler did\nit\". One of the pairs (pair XIII) Euler lists is incorrect.\n",

Even if the exterior algebra\nover a vector space is a well known concept, the construction of an exterior\nalgebra over an affine space, in which points and vectors coexist, has been\nneglected. This paper wants to fill this lack.\n  Some attention is given to the introduction of defining by abstraction (today\ncalled definition by quotienting or by equivalence relation), a procedure due\nto and used by Peano to define geometric forms, basic elements of an affine\nexterior algebra. This Peano's innovative way of defining, is a relevant\ncontribution to mathematics.\n  It is observed that in the construction of an affine exterior algebra on the\nEuclidean three-dimensional space, Grassmann and Peano make use of metric\nconcepts: an accurate analysis shows that, in some cases, the metric aspects\ncan be eliminated, putting into evidence the sufficiency of the underlying\naffine structure of the Euclidean space.\n  In the final part of the paper some geometrical and mechanical applications\nand interpretations of the affine exterior algebra given by Grassmann and Peano\nare presented.\n",

Around 1930 Severi\nand Guareschi, in a series of mutually fecundating individual papers,\ncharacterized differentiability in terms of 'lower tangent cones' and strict\ndifferentiability in terms of 'lower paratangent cones', a notion introduced,\nindependently, by Severi and Bouligand in 1928.

The data constituting this latter part are\nobtained by planned observations, focussed experiments, and afterwards\ncollected in growing databases (formerly known as \"books\", \"tables\",\n\"encyclopaedias\" etc).\n  In this discussion Kolomogorov complexity plays a role of the central\nmetaphor.\n  The second part and Appendix 1 are dedicated to more precise definitions and\nexamples of complexity.\n",

We also consider extensions of the game rules to other group\nstructures.\n  Note: While this is an article for general readership originally published\nonline by Gathering for Gardner in honor of Martin Gardner's birthday (Oct.\n2011), Al-Jabar has been played in university abstract algebra courses as a\nteaching tool, as well as by game enthusiasts, since its release. Moreover, the\nalgebraic game structure described has sparked further work by other\nmathematicians and game designers. Thus, we submit this article to the ArXiV as\na resource for educators as well as those interested in mathematical games.\n",

The primary\nconcerns are: Why do so many children find elementary mathematics difficult?\nAnd, why are the ones who succeed still so poorly prepared for college material\nneeded for technical careers? The answer provided by conventional wisdom is\nessentially that mathematics is difficult. Third-graders are not\ndevelopmentally ready for the subtlety of fractions, for instance, and even\nhigh-performing students cannot be expected to develop the skills of\nexperienced users. However we will see that this is far from the whole story\nand is probably wrong: elementary-education fractions are genuinely harder and\nless effective than the version employed by experienced users. Experts discard\nat least 90% of what is taught in schools. Our educational system is actually\ncounterproductive for skill development, and the reasons for this are an\nimportant secondary concern.\n",

In fact, Lobachevsky developed a large set of analytical and\ngeometrical theorems in non-Euclidean geometry using these formulae. (2)\nDifferential and integral calculus are developed in hyperbolic space without\nthe use of any Euclidean model of hyperbolic space. (3) There exist models of\nspherical and of Euclidean geometry within hyperbolic geometry, and these\nmodels are used to prove the hyperbolic trigonometry formulae. (4) If\nhyperbolic geometry were contradictory, then either Euclidean or spherical\ngeometry would be contradictory. We shall also see that some of these ideas\nwere rediscovered by later mathematicians.\n",

Whereas Mayan mathematics were based on a vigesimal system,\nthey used a different base when dealing with long periods of time, the Long\nCount Calendar (LCC), composed of different Long Count Periods: the Tun of 360\ndays, the Katun of 7200 days and the Baktun of 144000 days. There were two\nother calendars used in addition to the LCC: a civil year Haab' of 365 days and\na religious year Tzolk'in of 260 days. Another cycle was also in use: a\n3276-day cycle (combination of the 819-day Kawil cycle and the 4\ndirections-colors). Based on the hypothesis that Mayan astronomers had a good\nknowledge of naked-eye astronomy, we propose here an explanation of the origin\nof the LCC, the Haab', the Tzolk'in and the 3276-day cycle.

It is very easy to use, estimating a team's winning\npercentage from the runs they score and allow. This data is readily available\non standings pages; no computationally intensive simulations are needed.\nNormally accurate to within a few games per season, it allows teams to\ndetermine how much a run is worth in different situations. This determination\nhelps solve some of the most important economic decisions a team faces: How\nmuch is a player worth, which players should be pursued, and how much should\nthey be offered. We discuss the formula and these applications in detail, and\nprovide a theoretical justification, both for the formula as well as simpler\nlinear estimators of a team's winning percentage. The calculations and modeling\nare discussed in detail, and when possible multiple proofs are given. We\nanalyze the 2012 season in detail, and see that the data for that and other\nrecent years support our modeling conjectures. We conclude with a discussion of\nwork in progress to generalize the formula and increase its predictive power\n\\emph{without} needing expensive simulations, though at the cost of requiring\nplay-by-play data.\n",

Miller and his colleagues provided a\ntheoretical justification by modeling runs scored and allowed by independent\nWeibull distributions. They showed that a single Weibull distribution did a\nvery good job of describing runs scored and allowed, and led to a predicted\nwon-loss percentage of $({\\rm RS_{\\rm obs}}-1/2)^\\gamma / (({\\rm RS_{\\rm\nobs}}-1/2)^\\gamma + ({\\rm RA_{\\rm obs}}-1/2)^\\gamma)$, where ${\\rm RS_{\\rm\nobs}}$ and ${\\rm RA_{\\rm obs}}$ are the observed runs scored and allowed and\n$\\gamma$ is the shape parameter of the Weibull (typically close to 1.8). We\nshow a linear combination of Weibulls more accurately determines a team's run\nproduction and increases the prediction accuracy of a team's winning percentage\nby an average of about 25% (thus while the currently used variants of the\noriginal predictor are accurate to about four games a season, the new\ncombination is accurate to about three). The new formula is more involved\ncomputationally; however, it can be easily computed on a laptop in a matter of\nminutes from publicly available season data. It performs as well (or slightly\nbetter) than the related Pythagorean formulas in use, and has the additional\nadvantage of having a theoretical justification for its parameter values (and\nnot just an optimization of parameters to minimize prediction error).\n",

        "summary": "  A fractal can be simply understood as a set or pattern in which there are far\nmore small things than large ones, e.g., far more small geographic features\nthan large ones on the earth surface, or far more large-scale maps than\nsmall-scale maps for a geographic region. This paper attempts to argue and\nprovide evidence for the fractal nature of maps and mapping. It is the\nunderlying fractal structure of geographic features, either natural or\nhuman-made, that make reality mappable, large-scale maps generalizable, and\ncities imageable. The fractal nature is also what underlies the beauty of maps.\nAfter introducing some key fractal concepts such as recursion, self-similarity,\nscaling ratio, and scaling exponent, this paper demonstrates that fractal\nthought is rooted in long-standing map-making practices such as series maps\nsubdivision, visual hierarchy, and T\\\"opfer's radical law. Drawing on previous\nstudies on head/tail breaks, mapping can be considered a head/tail breaks\nprocess; that is to divide things around an average, according to their\ngeometric, topological and/or semantic properties, into the head (for those\nabove the average) and the tail (for those below the average), and recursively\ncontinue the dividing process for the head for map generalization, statistical\nmapping, and cognitive mapping. Given the fractal nature of maps and mapping,\ncartography should be considered a perfect combination of science and art, and\nscaling must be formulated as a law of cartography or that of geography in\ngeneral.\n  Keywords: Scaling of geographic features, map generalization, statistical\nmapping, cognitive mapping, head/tail breaks\n",

We elaborate on\ntwo such results. The first one, known as Lexell's Theorem (Lexell was a\nstudent of Euler), concerns the locus of the vertices of a spherical triangle\nwith a fixed area and a given base. This is the spherical counterpart of a\nresult in Euclid's Elements, but it is much more difficult to prove than its\nEuclidean analogue. The second result, due to Euler, is the spherical analogue\nof a generalization of a theorem of Pappus (Proposition 117 of Book VII of the\nCollection) on the construction of a triangle inscribed in a circle whose sides\nare contained in three lines that pass through three given points. Both results\nhave many ramifications, involving several mathematicians, and we mention some\nof these developments.

We explore this old\nquestion from a modern viewpoint, taking into account linear algebra, shape\ntheory, numerical analysis, random matrix theory, the Hopf fibration, and much\nmuch more. One of the best distributions of random triangles takes all six\nvertex coordinates as independent standard Gaussians. Six can be reduced to\nfour by translation of the center to $(0,0)$ or reformulation as a 2x2 matrix\nproblem.\n  In this note, we develop shape theory in its historical context for a wide\naudience. We hope to encourage other to look again (and differently) at\ntriangles.\n  We provide a new constructive proof, using the geometry of parallelians, of a\ncentral result of shape theory: Triangle shapes naturally fall on a hemisphere.\nWe give several proofs of the key random result: that triangles are uniformly\ndistributed when the normal distribution is transferred to the hemisphere. A\nnew proof connects to the distribution of random condition numbers.\nGeneralizing to higher dimensions, we obtain the \"square root ellipticity\nstatistic\" of random matrix theory.\n  Another proof connects the Hopf map to the SVD of 2 by 2 matrices. A new\ntheorem describes three similar triangles hidden in the hemisphere. Many\ntriangle properties are reformulated as matrix theorems, providing insight to\nboth. This paper argues for a shift of viewpoint to the modern approaches of\nrandom matrix theory. As one example, we propose that the smallest singular\nvalue is an effective test for uniformity. New software is developed and\napplications are proposed.\n",

In further work about the approximation of algebraic numbers\n(2,3) famously Thue used instead a completely different tool, the drawer method\nof Dirichlet, and showed further that the above statement holds for any\nalgebraic number. Thue's methods were later generalized by Siegel(4,5,6,7) who\nshowed, among other things, that for every algebraic number in the above\ninequality the exponent $\\frac{n}{2}+1+\\epsilon$ could be replaced by\n$\\frac{n}{m}+m-1+\\epsilon$, where $m$ is some natural number.\n  This note demonstrates a generalization of Thue's methods in (1); Like Thue I\nrestrict myself to the roots $\\xi =\\sqrt[n]{\\frac{a}{b}}$ of the binomial\nequations. The continued fraction expansion of the binomial series is\ngeneralized and algebraic approximation functions are given instead of rational\napproximation functions. In doing so I proceed exactly as in my work on the\nexponential function(8). Integrals are set up for the approximation functions;\nthus the estimates become much easier and you can prove Thue's theorem with\nSiegel's Exponents for the binomial algebraic equations without difficulty and\nwithout use of the pigeonhole principle.\n",

Advancements in\ntechnology and, taking the student as the focus of his own learning, led to a\nchange of paradigm in the design and development of educational contents. In\nthis paper we describe the first experience with an interactive feedback and\nassessment tool (Siacua), based on parameterized math exercises, and explain\nhow we use it to motivate student independent study in a multivariate calculus\nenvironment. We have defined an index about the subject, trying to make it\nconsensual enough for being used in other courses about multivariate calculus.\nThen we have created a concept map, selected some existing parameterized\ntrue/false questions from PmatE project and classified them using our concept\nmap, for being reused in our system. For complementing the course we have\ncreated about one hundred parameterized multiple choice question templates in\nsystem Megua and generated about one thousand instances for using in Siacua.\nResults based on data collected by this tool and also based on an informal\nsurvey are presented. This first experience allows us to conclude our approach\nhas an important impact on student motivation and contributes to the success on\nlearning multivariate calculus.\n",

In particular, we do not use\nthe terms `Galois group' and even `group'.

So\nthe note provides a bridge (by showing that there is no gap) between elementary\nmathematics and Galois theory. The note is accessible to students familiar with\npolynomials, complex numbers and permutations; so the note might be interesting\neasy reading for professional mathematicians.\n",

        "summary": "  Numbers are often used to define more complicated numbers. For example, two\nintegers are used to define a rational number and two reals are used to define\na complex number. It might be expected that an irrational power of an\nirrational number would be an irrational number. Despite that, it is actually\npossible for an irrational power of an irrational number to be a rational\nnumber. For many generations, this circulated as a non-constructive proof by\ncontradiction in logic for discrete mathematics textbooks and college courses.\nSince the 80s, a constructive proof circulated orally, such as\n$\\sqrt{2}^{log_\\sqrt{2} 3}$ equals to 3. A written proof was published in 2008\nby Lord. The first contribution of this paper is to prove that there is an\nuncountable number of such pairs of irrational numbers such that the power of\none to the other is a rational number. Marshall and Tan answered the question\nof whether there is a single irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational.\nThey proved that given $I$ = $(\\frac{1}{e})^{(\\frac{1}{e},\\infty)}$, then every\nrational number in $I$ is either of the form $a^a$ for an irrational $a$ or is\nin the very thin set $\\{1,4,27,256,...,n^n,...\\}$. It seems a challenging task\nto analytically solve the equation $x^x=y$ for any real $y$. To the best of our\nknowledge, there is no work on finding $x$ from a given $y$. We proved that\n$ln((ln(y))<x$ for $y>e$ and $x<ln(y)$, for $y> e^e$. Hence, the second\ncontribution of this paper is to estimate the real $x$ such that either one of\nthe equations $x^x=y$ or $x^{x^x}=y$ holds, for a given $y$.\n",

Two aspects stand out as permanent features of his different approaches:\nthe {\\em unique determination of an affine connection} (i.e., without torsion\nin the terminology of Cartan) and the question {\\em which type of group}\ncharacterizes physical space. The first feature came up in 1919 (commentaries\nto Riemann's inaugural lecture) and played a crucial role in Weyl's work on the\nPoS in the early 1920s. He defended the central role of affine connections even\nin the light of Cartan's more general framework of connections with torsion. In\nlater years, after the rise of the Dirac field, it could have become\nproblematic, but Weyl saw the challenge posed to Einstein gravity by spin\ncoupling primarily in the possibility to allow for non-metric affine\nconnections. Only after Weyl's death Cartan's approach to infinitesimal\nhomogeneity and torsion became revitalized in gravity theories.\n",

The theory is preceded by a general chapter on counting\nmethods. Then, the theory of probabilities is presented in a discrete\nframework. Two objectives are sought. The first is to give the reader the\nability to solve a large number of problems related to probability theory,\nincluding application problems in a variety of disciplines. The second was to\nprepare the reader before he approached the manual on the mathematical\nfoundations of probability theory. In this book, the reader will concentrate\nmore on mathematical concepts, while in the present text, experimental\nframeworks are mostly found. If both objectives are met, the reader will have\nalready acquired a definitive experience in problem-solving ability with the\ntools of probability theory and at the same time he is ready to move on to a\ntheoretical course on probability theory based on the theory of measurement and\nintegration. The book ends with a chapter that allows the reader to begin an\nintermediate course in mathematical statistics.\n",

Second, the only quadrilaterals which have\ninscribed ellipses tangent at the midpoint of even two sides of $Q$ are\ntrapezoids or what we call a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral(the intersection\npoint of the diagonals of $Q$ coincides with the midpoint of at least one of\nthe diagonals of $Q$).\n",

This arises by\nstraightforward combination of a) Kendall's Theorem - that the space of all\ntriangles is a sphere - and b) the natural map sending triangles in space to\npoints in this shape sphere. The answer is 3/4. Our method moreover readily\ngeneralizes to a wider class of problems, since a) and b) both have many\napplications and admit large generalizations: Shape Theory. An elementary and\nthus widely accessible prototype for Shape Theory is thereby desirable, and\nextending Kendall's already-notable prototype a) by demonstrating that b)\nreadily solves Lewis Carroll's well-known pillow problem indeed provides a\nmemorable and considerably stronger prototype. This is a prototype of, namely,\nmapping flat geometry problems directly realized in a space to shape space,\nwhere differential-geometric tools are readily available to solve the problem\nand then finally re-interpret it in the original `shape-in-space' terms. We\nillustrate this program's versatility by posing and solving a number of\nvariants of the pillow problem. We first find Prob(Isosceles is Obtuse). We\nsubsequently define tall and flat triangles, as bounded by regular triangles\nwhose base-to-median ratio is that of the equilateral triangle. These\ndefinitions have Jacobian and Hopfian motivation as well as entering Kendall's\nown considerations of `splinters': almost-collinear triangles. We find that\nProb(Tall) = 1/2 = Prob(Flat) is immediately apparent from regularity's\nsymmetric realization in shape space. However, Prob(Obtuse and Flat),\nProb(Obtuse is Flat) and all other nontrivial expressions concerning having any\ntwo of the properties mentioned above, or having one of these conditioned on\nanother, constitute nontrivial variants of the pillow problem, and we solve\nthem all.\n",

As such this paper,\nand the journal in question, represents one representative attempt to analyze -\nfor the purpose of possible future generalization - how research production has\nevolved, and evolves, over time. Among the general developments that we think\nwe can trace are that (a) the historical overviews (i.e., literature surveys)\nin the articles, as well as the list of references, somewhat\ncounter-intuitively shrink over time, while (b) the motivating and modelling\nparts grow. We also attempt to characterize - in some detail - the appearance\nand character, over time, of the most cited, as well as the least cited, papers\nover the years studied. In particular, we find that many of the least cited\npapers are quite imbalanced. For example, some of them include one main section\nonly, and the least cited papers also have shorter reference lists.\n  We also analyse the articles' utilization of important buzz words\nrepresenting the constitutive parts of an OR journal paper, based on Subben's\nchecklist (Larsson and Patriksson, 2014, 2016). Based on a word count of these\nbuzz words we conclude through a citation study, utilizing a collection of\nparticularly highly or little cited papers, that there is a quite strong\npositive correlation between a journal paper being highly cited and its degree\nof utilization of this checklist.\n",

It is known that $D(N)$ can be bounded above by\n$$ D(N) \\leq C^* \\Theta(N), \\quad \\Theta(N):= \\frac{N}{\\log^2\nN}\\prod_{\\substack{p|N p>2}} \\left( 1 +\n\\frac{1}{p-2}\\right)\\prod_{p>2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right) $$ where $C^*$\ndenotes Chen's constant. It is conjectured that $C^*=2$. In 2004, Wu showed\nthat $C^* \\leq 7.8209$. We attempted to replicate his work in computing Chen's\nconstant, and in doing so we provide an improved approximation of the Buchstab\nfunction $\\omega(u)$, \\begin{align*} \\omega(u)=1/u, & \\quad (1\\leq u\\leq 2), (u\n\\omega(u))'=\\omega(u-1), & \\quad (u\\geq 2). \\end{align*} based on work done by\nCheer and Goldston. For each interval $[j,j+1]$, they expressed $\\omega(u)$ as\na Taylor expansion about $u=j+1$. We expanded about the point $u=j+0.5$, so\n$\\omega(u)$ was never evaluated more than $0.5$ away from the center of the\nTaylor expansion, which gave much stronger error bounds.\n  Issues arose while using this Taylor expansion to compute the required\nintegrals for Chen's constant, so we proceeded with solving the above\ndifferential equation to obtain $\\omega(u)$, and then integrating the result.\nAlthough the values that were obtained undershot Wu's results, we pressed on\nand refined Wu's work by discretising his integrals with finer granularity. The\nimprovements to Chen's constant were negligible (as predicted by Wu). This\nprovides experimental evidence, but not a proof, that were Wu's integrals\ncomputed on smaller intervals in exact form, the improvement to Chen's constant\nwould be negligible. Thus, any substantial improvement on Chen's constant\nlikely requires a radically different method to what Wu provided.\n",

Four rows consisting of 1 coin in row 1, 2 coins in\nrow 2, 3 coins in row 3, and 4 coins in row 4 form the shape of a triangle.\nWhat is the fewest number of coins you need to move to flip the triangle 180\ndegrees so that it points in the opposite direction? In the case of 4 rows, it\nrequires moving just 3 coins. The general solution for any number of rows can\nbe calculated by dividing the number of coins by 3 and ignoring any remainder.\nA triangle of 4 rows has 10 coins, so 10/3 = 3.333 leads to 3 moves. However,\nthis calculation is fairly nonintuitive as to why it works and requires an\ninelegant maneuver of periodically discarding a remainder. In this paper, we\npresent a more intuitive formula that always calculates the answer directly and\nnever produces a decimal answer. Further, we explore inverting other shapes\n(e.g., rhombus) and find an interesting connection to the formula for\ntriangles.\n",

The set of these Japanese tans is slightly different from the\nwell-known set of 7 Chinese tans with which 13 (out of those 16) convex\ntangrams can be formed. In [4], [6] the problem of determining all essentially\ndifferent partitions of the 13 \"Chinese\" convex tangrams was investigated and\nsolved. In this report we will address the same problem for the \"Japanese\"\nconvex tangrams. The approach to solve both problems is more or less analogous,\nbut the \"Japanese\" problem is much harder than the \"Chinese\" one, since the\nnumber of \"Japanese\" solutions is much larger than the \"Chinese\" ones. In fact,\nonly for a few \"Japanese\" tangram shapes their solutions can be found by a\nrigorous analysis supported by a large number of clarifying diagrams. The\nsolutions for the remaining shapes have to be determined using a dedicated\ncomputer program. Both approaches will be discussed here and all essentially\ndifferent solutions with the \"Japanese\" tans are presented. As far as we know\nall presented results are not yet published before.\n",

The basic reason for this is that essentially all fundamental laws\nof physics are formulated in terms of PDEs. In addition, approximations to\nthese fundamental laws, that form a patchwork of mathematical models covering\nthe range from the smallest to the largest observable space-time scales, are\nalso formulated in terms of PDEs. The diverse applications of PDEs in science\nand technology testify to the flexibility and expressiveness of the language of\nPDEs, but it also makes it a hard topic to teach right. Exactly because of the\ndiversity of applications, there are just so many different points of view when\nit comes to PDEs. These lecture notes view the subject through the lens of\napplied mathematics. From this point of view, the physical context for basic\nequations like the heat equation, the wave equation and the Laplace equation\nare introduced early on, and the focus of the lecture notes are on methods,\nrather than precise mathematical definitions and proofs. With respect to\nmethods, both analytical and numerical approaches are discussed.\n  These lecture notes has been succesfully used as the text for a master class\nin partial differential equations for several years.

As\nfirst, we conduct the textual analysis of the most significant works written by\neminent probability theorists. The textual analysis turns out to be a rather\ninnovative method of study in this domain, and shows how the sampled writers,\nno matter he is a frequentist or a subjectivist, share a similar approach. Each\nauthor argues on the multifold aspects of probability then he establishes the\nmathematical theory on the basis of his intellectual conclusions. It may be\nsaid that mathematics ranks second. Hilbert foresees an approach far different\nfrom that used by the sampled authors. He proposes to axiomatize the\nprobability calculus notably to describe the probability concepts using purely\nmathematical criteria. In the second stage of the present research we address\nthe four issues of the probability theory and statistics following the\nrecommendations of Hilbert. Specifically, we use two theorems that prove how\nthe frequentist and the subjectivist models are not incompatible as many\nbelieve. Probability has distinct meanings under different hypotheses, and in\nturn classical statistics and Bayesian statistics are available for adoption in\ndifferent circumstances. Subsequently, these results are commented upon,\nfollowed by our conclusions\n",

From the outset, our\nrationale for a very careful search on an apparently obscure problem was not\nonly a matter of mathematical curiosity, but also motivated by a quest for 3D\nFibonacci spirals. As we were not able to find any survey on the particular\ntopic of cubic Fibonacci identities we decided to try to fill this void. We\nstarted by surveying many Fibonacci identities and recording cubic ones.\nObviously, tracing all Fibonacci identities (for identifying a handful) is a\ndaunting task. Checking several hundred we have realized that it is not always\nclear who the author is. The reason is that in many cases an identity was\nstated in one article (sometimes without a proof, e.g., as an open problem, or\na conjecture) while later being proven in another article, or effectively\nrediscovered independently by other authors. However, we have done our best to\npresent the identities chronologically. We have supplied our own proof for one\nidentity, having tried, but failed, to find a published proof. For all the\nother identities, we either proved them on a computer, or else verified by hand\ntheir original published proofs. Somehow unexpectedly, our investigations have\nrevealed only a rather small number of cubic Fibonacci identities, representing\na tiny fraction of all published Fibonacci identities (most of which are linear\nor quadratic). Finally, out of these, only a handful of cubic Fibonacci\nidentities are homogeneous.\n",

It was pursued vigorously over the next two decades,\nlargely by British physicists and mathematicians, in two contexts: Maxwell's\nvortex analogy for the electromagnetic field and William Thomson's (Lord\nKelvin) theory that atoms were vortex rings in an all-pervading ether. By the\ntime of Maxwell's death in 1879, the basic laws of vortices in a perfect fluid\nin three-dimensional Euclidean space had been established, as had their\nimportance to physics. Early vortex studies were embedded in a web of issues\nspanning the fields we now know as \"mathematics\" and \"physics\" - fields which\nhad not yet become institutionally distinct disciplines but overlapped. This\npaper investigates the conceptual issues with ideas of force, matter, and\nspace, that underlay mechanics and led to vortex models being an attractive\nproposition for British physicists, and how these issues played out in the\nmathematics of vortices, paying particular attention to problems around\ncontinuity. It concludes that while they made valuable contributions to\nhydrodynamics and the nascent field of topology, the British ultimately failed\nin their more physical objectives.\n",

For example, the detailed\ndescriptions by 17th century scientist Robert Boyle of his vacuum pump\nexperiments are often held to be the ideal of reproducibility as a cornerstone\nof scientific practice. Victoria Stodden has claimed that the computer is an\nanalog for Boyle's pump -- another kind of scientific instrument that needs\ndetailed descriptions of how it generates results. In the place of Boyle's\nhand-written notes, we now expect code in open source programming languages to\nbe available to enable others to reproduce and extend computational\nexperiments. In this paper we show that there is another genealogy for\nreproducibility, starting at least from Euclid, in the production of proofs in\nmathematics. Proofs have a distinctive quality of being necessarily\nreproducible, and are the cornerstone of mathematical science. However, the\ntask of the modern mathematical scientist has drifted from that of blackboard\nrhetorician, where the craft of proof reigned, to a scientific workflow that\nnow more closely resembles that of an experimental scientist. So, what is proof\nin modern mathematics? And, if proof is unattainable in other fields, what is\ndue scientific diligence in a computational experimental environment? How do we\nmeasure truth in the context of uncertainty? Adopting a manner of Lakatosian\nconversant conjecture between two mathematicians, we examine how proof informs\nour practice of computational statistical inquiry. We propose that a\nreorientation of mathematical science is necessary so that its reproducibility\ncan be readily assessed.\n",

In a recent text, Easwaran and Towsner (ET)\nanalyze the applicability of mathematical techniques in the sciences, and\nintroduce a distinction between techniques that are applicable and those that\nare merely instrumental. Unfortunately the authors have not shown that their\ndistinction is a clear and fruitful one, as the examples they provide are\nsuperficial and unconvincing. Moreover, their analysis is vitiated by a\nreliance on a naive version of object realism which has long been abandoned by\nmost philosophical realists in favor of truth-value realism. ET's argument\nagainst the applicability of hyperreals based on automorphisms of hyperreal\nmodels involves massaging the evidence and is similarly unconvincing. The\npurpose of the ET text is to argue that Robinson's infinitesimal analysis is\nmerely instrumental rather than applicable. Yet in spite of Robinson's\ntechniques being applied in physics, probability, and economics, ET don't\nbother to provide a meaningful analysis of even a single case in which these\ntechniques are used. Instead, ET produce page after page of speculations mainly\nimitating Connesian chimera-type arguments `from first principles' against\nRobinson. In an earlier paper Easwaran endorsed real applicability of the\nsigma-additivity of measures, whereas the ET text rejects real applicability of\nthe axiom of choice, voicing a preference for ZF. Since it is consistent with\nZF that the Lebesgue measure is not sigma-additive, Easwaran is thereby walking\nback his earlier endorsement.

Thus, Gilain and Siegmund-Schultze assume that references to limite in\nCauchy's work necessarily imply that Cauchy was working with an Archi-medean\ncontinuum, whereas infinitesimals were merely a convenient figure of speech,\nfor which Cauchy had in mind a complete justification in terms of Archimedean\nlimits. However, there is another formalisation of Cauchy's procedures\nexploiting his limite, more consistent with Cauchy's ubiquitous use of\ninfinitesimals, in terms of the standard part principle of modern infinitesimal\nanalysis.\n  We challenge a misconception according to which Cauchy was allegedly forced\nto teach infinitesimals at the Ecole Polytechnique. We show that the debate\nthere concerned mainly the issue of rigor, a separate one from infinitesimals.\nA critique of Cauchy's approach by his contemporary de Prony sheds light on the\nmeaning of rigor to Cauchy and his contemporaries. An attentive reading of\nCauchy's work challenges received views on Cauchy's role in the history of\nanalysis, and indicates that he was a pioneer of infinitesimal techniques as\nmuch as a harbinger of the Epsilontik.\n",

This problem\nsounds like a geometry problem, but it is likely to require techniques in\nnumber theory. That's because, to determine if the distance between (a,b) and\n(s,t) is rational, you need to test whether $(a-s)^2$ + $(b-t)^2$ is the square\nof a rational number...and such questions typically fall into the realm of\nnumber theory. Of course, since this is an open problem, no-one can claim to\nknow just what field the problem lies in, since no-one knows the solution. I\nbelieve it is not even known if there are more than 5 points on the parabola\nwhich satisfy the condition. It is certainly not known if there is an infinite\nfamily with pairwise rational distances. We can quickly see that there are\nthree such points in the following way: Pick two rational numbers, say 1/5 and\n3/5, and let those be the distances between the pairs of points AB and BC. If\nyou fix those distances and slide the points up the parabola, the distance AC\nwill gradually increase, bounded above by 4/5. Since the rational numbers are\ndense in the reals, there will be many placements of the points so that AC is a\nrational distance. It is not too hard to show that if you have N points on the\nparabola with rational distances between them, then you can find N points on\nthe parabola with integer distances between them.\n  This problem is publicly posted on the DIMACS mathematical research website\nin order to search for solutions. This paper demonstrates that an infinite\nnumber of families each containing an arbitrarily large number of such pairwise\nrational points on the parabola can be found. A constructive algorithm for\ndoing so is outlined in the paper.\n",

Such\nlinkages include Bricard6R and Bennett4R. To design such a closed linkage, it\nis necessary to solve a high-degree algebraic equation, which is generally\ndifficult. In this lecture, the author proposes a new family of closed linkage\nmechanisms with an arbitrary number of hinges as an extension of a certain\nBricard6R. They have singular properties, such as one-dimensional degree of\nfreedom (1-DOF), and certain energies taking a constant value regardless of the\nstate. These linkage mechanisms can be regarded as discrete M\\\"obius strips and\nmay be of interest in the context of pure mathematics as well. However, many of\nthe properties described here have been confirmed only numerically, with no\nrigorous mathematical proof, and should be interpreted with caution.\n",

Janet introduced an original formal approach\nto deal with the solvability of the problem of initial conditions for finite\nlinear PDE systems. His constructions implicitly used an interpretation of a\nmonomial PDE system as a generating family of a multiplicative set of\nmonomials. He introduced an algorithmic method on multiplicative sets to\ncompute compatibility conditions, and to study the problem of the existence and\nthe unicity of a solution to a linear PDE system with given initial conditions.\nThe compatibility conditions are formulated using a refinement of the division\noperation on monomials defined with respect to a partition of the set of\nvariables into multiplicative and non-multiplicative variables. M.

While the 2-sphere is embedded in 3-space,\nfour-dimensional Euclidean space is needed to visualize the 3-sphere.\nVisualizing objects in 4-space using computer graphics based on their\nanalytical representations has become popular in recent decades. For purely\nsynthetic constructions, we apply the recently introduced method of\nvisualization of 4-space by its double orthogonal projection onto two mutually\nperpendicular 3-spaces to investigate the Hopf fibration as a four-dimensional\nrelation without analogy in lower dimensions. In this paper, the method of\ndouble orthogonal projection is used for a direct synthetic construction of the\nfibers of a 3-sphere from the corresponding points on a 2-sphere. The fibers of\ngreat circles on the 2-sphere create nested tori visualized in a stereographic\nprojection onto the modeling 3-space. The step-by-step construction is\nsupplemented by dynamic three-dimensional models showing simultaneously the\n3-sphere, 2-sphere, and stereographic images of the fibers and mutual\ninterrelations. Each step of the synthetic construction is supported by its\nanalytical representation to highlight connections between the two\ninterpretations.\n",

However, this view makes it hard to\naccommodate function names of two arguments and view functions as incomplete\nentities. I propose and defend an alternative interpretation of first-level\nfunction names in Grundgesetze into simple type-theoretic open terms rather\nthan into closed terms of a function type. This interpretation offers a still\nunhistorical but more faithful type-theoretic approximation of Frege's theory\nof levels and can be naturally extended to accommodate second-level functions.\nIt is made possible by two key observations that Frege's Roman markers behave\nessentially like open terms and that Frege lacks a clear criterion for\ndistinguishing between Roman markers and function names.\n",

The concept foresees traditional blackboard lectures\nwith a reduced number of students present in the lecture hall, while the same\nlectures are simultaneously made available to the remaining students via high\nquality low-bandwidth online streaming. Based on our first assumption that\ntraditional blackboard lectures, including the gestures and the facial\nexpressions of the professor, are still a very efficient and highly appreciated\nmeans of teaching mathematics, this paper deliberately does not want to propose\na novel pedagogical concept of how to teach mathematics, but rather presents a\ntechnical concept how to preserve the quality of traditional blackboard\nlectures even during the pandemic and how to make them available to the\nstudents at home via online streaming with adequate audio and video quality at\nlow internet bandwidth. The second assumption is that the teaching of\nmathematics is a dynamic creative process that requires the physical presence\nof students in the lecture hall as audience so that the professor can\ninstantaneously fine-tune the evolution of the lecture according to his/her\nperception of the level of attention and the facial expressions of the\nstudents. The third assumption of this paper is that students need to have the\npossibility to interact with each other personally. We report on the necessary\nhardware, software and logistics, and on the perception of the proposed blended\nlectures by students from civil and environmental engineering at the University\nof Trento, compared to traditional lectures and also compared to the pure\nonline lectures that were needed as emergency measure at the beginning of the\npandemic.\n",

Another rather infamous perpetual\ncalendar has been used for nearly four centuries among Javanese people in\nIndonesia. This Javanese calendar combines the Saka Hindu, lunar Islamic, and\nwestern Gregorian calendars. In addition to the regular seven-day, lunar month,\nand lunar year cycles, it also contains five-day pasaran, 35-day wetonan,\n210-day pawukon, octo-year windu, and 120-year kurup cycles. The Javanese\ncalendar is used for cultural and spiritual purposes, including a decision to\ntie the knot among couples.

Thus we hope to tackle this problem using more elementary\nMathematics concepts. In this report, we start with the simplest cases, with\nthe smaller numbers: the number of ways to tile a $2 \\times n$, $3 \\times n$,\n$4 \\times n$ rectangular board using $2 \\times 1$ domino tiles, where the\nnumber of rows is fixed and we present a recursive formula based on $m$ and the\nearlier terms. This allows us to deduce the non-recursive formula for each case\nthat is only dependent on $m$. For each case, we also expand and generalize the\nproblem, not just for $2$, $3$, $4$ but for any positive integer $k$, for\ncertain types of configurations of the board. We also focus on one of the\nfamous variations of the tiling problem: tatami tiling, and present a solution\nfor simple cases: $2 \\times n$, $3 \\times n$, $4 \\times n$. In the end, we have\nmanaged to find a simpler solution for three different configurations of the\nboard, with some we even deduced the non-recursive formula. We have also solved\nsimple cases of the tatami tiling problem, with the hope to tackle the general\ncase in the future. We realized that our method only works on a case-by-case\nbasis, with little success in solving the general case. This approach is also\napplicable in many other counting problems which we wish to pursue for further\nresearch.\n",

It is also used by fishermen\nto guide them not only in capturing fish and other aquatic animals but also in\npredicting the type of seafood they might gather. Although the Javanese possess\nand maintain their own calendrical system based on a combination of solar and\nlunar calendars, pranata mangsa is solely based on the solar calendar and\npassed on from one generation to the next verbally. Literature has confirmed\nthat by combining this local knowledge and scientific data, the Javanese\ncommunity has a better resilience in adapting to extreme hydrological events\ndue to global warming and climate change. In this comment, we provide remarks\non ethnic groups and the four sample cities in Java where the latter were\nselected for the pranata mangsa study.\n",

We try and understand the reasons for the enduring importance of\nthis paper. Our conclusions are the following: 1. Mathematics is not\ncumulative, but lost material may be recovered through examination of ancient\nworks. 2. An apparent paradox is that the degree of dissemination of ideas and\nconcepts among mathematicians is not determined only by geographic or social\naffiliation (countries, cities, scientific schools, etc.). On the contrary, the\nexistence of common scientific goals makes it possible to transfer and use\nthese concepts. 3. Older papers, because they are not influenced by modern\nclassifications, can help generate ideas that do not arise naturally in a\nmodern framework. Thus, a historical perspective can help bring about new\nmathematics and indeed, is a necessary dimension of mathematical research.\n",

Prompted by the occurrence of the paradox in\nCervantes's Don Quixote, I discuss and compare four distinct solutions to the\nproblem, namely Bradwardine's \"just false\" conception, Buridan's \"contingently\ntrue/false\" theory, Cervantes's \"both true and false\" view, and then\nJacquette's \"neither true simpliciter nor false simpliciter\" account. All have\nin common to accept that the Bridge expresses a truth-apt proposition, but only\nthe latter three endorse the transparency of truth. Against some previous\ncommentaries I first show that Buridan's solution is fully compliant with an\naccount of the paradox within classical logic. I then show that Cervantes's\ninsights, as well as Jacquette's treatment, are both supportive of a\ndialetheist account, and Jacquette's in particular of the strict-tolerant\naccount of truth. I defend dialetheist intuitions (whether in LP or ST guise)\nagainst two objections: one concerning the future, the other concerning the\nalleged simplicity of the Bridge compared to the Liar.\n",

We cultivated\nsustainable learning in mathematics education for college freshmen ($n = 55$)\nby exposing them to both the conventional teaching method (CTM) and flipped\nclassroom pedagogy (FCP). By splitting them into control and experimental\ngroups alternately ($n_1 = 24$, $n_2 = 31$) and by selecting the four most\nchallenging topics in college algebra, we measured their cognitive gains\nquantitatively via a sequence of pre- and post-tests. Both groups improved\nacademically over time across all these four topics with statistically very\nsignificant outcomes $(p < 0.001)$. Although they were not always statistically\nsignificant ($p > 0.05$) in some topics, the post-test results suggest that\ngenerally, the FCP trumps the CTM in cognitive gains, except for the first\ntopic on factorization, where the opposite is true with a very statistically\nsignificant mean difference $(p < 0.001)$. By examining non-cognitive gains\nqualitatively, we analyzed the students' feedback on the FCP and their\nresponses to a perception inventory. The finding suggests a favorable response\ntoward the FCP with primary improvements in the attitudes toward mathematics\nand increased levels of cooperation among students. Since these students are so\nhappy to have control of their own learning, they were more relaxed, motivated,\nconfident, active, and responsible in learning under the FCP. We are confident\nthat although this study is relatively small in scale, it will yield\nincremental and long-lasting effects not only for the learners themselves but\nalso for other role-takers in education sectors who aspire in nurturing\nsustainable long-life learning and achieving sustainable development goals\nsuccessfully.\n",

According\nto the most natural reading of the chapter, the argument appeals to a temporal\nconcept of truth and concludes that not every statement is always either true\nor false. However, many of Aristotle's followers and commentators have not\nadopted this reading. I believe that it has faced so much resistance for\nreasons of hermeneutic charity denying the law of universal bivalence seems to\nbe overly disruptive to logical orthodoxy the kind of logical orthodoxy\nrepresented by what we now call classical propositional logic, much of which\nAristotle clearly supports in many texts. I intend to show that the\nlogical-semantic theses that the traditional reading finds in De\nInterpretatione 9 are much more conservative than they may seem to be at first\nglance. First, I will show that they complement, and do not contradict in any\nway, the orthodox definitions of the concepts of truth and statement that\nAristotle advances in other texts. Second, by resorting in an anachronistic\nvein to concepts and methods peculiar to contemporary logic, I will show that a\ntrivalent modal semantics conforming to those theses can be built for a\nstandard formal language of the classical propositional calculus. It is\nremarkable that reasonable concepts of logical truth and logical consequence\nthat may be defined on the basis of this trivalent modal semantics are\ncoextensive with their orthodox counterparts, the concepts of tautology and\ntautological consequence of classical bivalent and extensional semantics.\n",

This solution complements the\nclassical procedure of determining the truth values of sentences by its own\nfailure and, when the procedure fails, through an appropriate semantic shift\nallows us to express the failure in a classical two-valued language. Formally\nspeaking, the solution is a language with one meaning of symbols and two\nvaluations of the truth values of sentences. The primary valuation is a\nclassical valuation that is partial in the presence of the truth predicate. It\nenables us to determine the classical truth value of a sentence or leads to the\nfailure of that determination. The language with the primary valuation is\nprecisely the largest intrinsic fixed point of the strong Kleene three-valued\nsemantics (LIFPSK3). The semantic shift that allows us to express the failure\nof the primary valuation is precisely the classical closure of LIFPSK3: it\nextends LIFPSK3 to a classical language in parts where LIFPSK3 is undetermined.\nThus, this article provides an argumentation, which has not been present in\ncontemporary debates so far, for the choice of LIFPSK3 and its classical\nclosure as the right model for the truth predicate. In the end, an erroneous\ncritique of Kripke-Feferman axiomatic theory of truth, which is present in\ncontemporary literature, is pointed out.\n",

It provides insight\ninto how to undertake and develop mathematically-powered products and services\nin a safe and responsible way. Rather than give a framework of objectives to\nachieve, we instead introduce a process that can be integrated into the common\nways in which mathematical products or services are created, from start to\nfinish. This process helps address the various issues and problems that can\narise for the product, the developers, the institution, and for wider society.\nTo do this, we break down the typical procedure of mathematical development\ninto 10 key stages; our \"10 pillars for responsible development\" which follow a\nsomewhat chronological ordering of the steps, and associated challenges, that\nfrequently occur in mathematical work. Together these 10 pillars cover issues\nof the entire lifecycle of a mathematical product or service, including the\npreparatory work required to responsibly start a project, central questions of\ngood technical mathematics and data science, and issues of communication,\ndeployment and follow-up maintenance specifically related to mathematical\nsystems. This manifesto, and the pillars within it, are the culmination of 7\nyears of work done by us as part of the Cambridge University Ethics in\nMathematics Project. These are all tried-and-tested ideas, that we have\npresented and used in both academic and industrial environments. In our work,\nwe have directly seen that mathematics can be an incredible tool for good in\nsociety, but also that without careful consideration it can cause immense harm.\nWe hope that following this manifesto will empower its readers to reduce the\nrisk of undesirable and unwanted consequences of their mathematical work.\n",

This philosophical difference between Kolmogorov and\nHeyting implies different treatments of problems and propositions: while in\nHeyting's view the difference between problems and propositions is merely\nlinguistic, Kolmogorov keeps the two concepts apart and does not apply his\ncalculus to propositions. I stress differences between Kolmogorov's and\nHeyting's interpretations and show how the two interpretations diverged during\ntheir development. In this context I reconstruct Kolmogorov's philosophical\nviews on mathematics and analyse his original take on the Hilbert-Brouwer\ncontroversy. Finally, I overview some later works motivated by Kolmogorov's\nCalculus of Problems and propose a justification of Kolmogorov's distinction\nbetween problems and propositions in terms of Univalent Mathematics.\n",

While ample research on mathematical modeling education and\npublished textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on\nmathematical modeling for sustainability. This review aims to address this gap\nby exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and\nsustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct\nrealms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting\nsustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and\nlearning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy\nthat enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday\nlife and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal\neducation. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling\nfor sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal\narts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related\nto sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can\nbe further developed for teaching such a course. Indeed, by filling the gap in\nthe literature and providing practical resources, this review contributes to\nthe advancement of mathematical modeling education in the context of\nsustainability.\n",

A) Every day, about 0.2-0.5% of\nplayers solve the puzzle in one attempt. Because the odds of guessing the one\nof 2,315 possible target words at random is 0.043%, this implies that 4,000 -\n10,000 players cheat by obtaining the target word outside of playing the game!\nB) At least 1/3 of the players have a favorite starting word, or cycle through\nseveral. And even though players should be aware that target words are never\nrepeated, most players appear to remain loyal to their starting word even after\nits appearance as a target word. C) On August 15, 2023, about 30,000 players\nabruptly changed their starting word, presumably based on a crossword puzzle\nclue! Wordle players can be influenced!

We also mention famous constructions related to our\nquestions. We begin our article at this point, where the standard teaching ends\nthe discussion of conic sections.

It has been suggested that\nthese systems might allow one to design analogue machines which would calculate\nthe values of some number-theoretic non-computable function. Analysis of the\nexamples show that the suggestion is wrong. In Section 4 I claim that given a\nreasonable definition of analogue machine it will always be wrong. The claim is\nto be read not so much as a dogmatic assertion, but rather as a challenge.\n  In Sections 1 and 2 I discuss analogue machines, and lay down some conditions\nwhich I believe they must satisfy. In Section I discuss the particular forms\nwhich a paradigm undecidable problem (or non-computable function) may take. In\nSections 5 and 6 I justify any claim for two particular examples lying within\nthe range of classical physics, and in Section 7 I justify it for two (closely\nconnected) examples from quantum mechanics, and discuss, very briefly, other\npossible quantum mechanical situations. Section 8 contains various remarks and\ncomments. In Section 9 I consider the suggestion made by Penrose that a\n(future) theory of quantum gravity may predict non-locally-determined, and\nperhaps non-computable patterns of growth for microsopic structures. My\nconclusion is that such a theory will have to have non-computability built into\nit.\n",

We\nintroduce IMP-TIP: Improving Math Reasoning with Tool-augmented Interleaf\nPrompting, a framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and\nTool-augmented LLMs. IMP-TIP follows the ``From Good to Great\" concept,\ncollecting multiple potential solutions from both LLMs and their Tool-Augmented\ncounterparts for the same math problem, and then selecting or re-generating the\nmost accurate answer after cross-checking these solutions via tool-augmented\ninterleaf prompting. The framework incorporates two key aspects: self-prompt\nand tool-augmented interleaf prompting (TIP). The former allows LLMs to\nautonomously refine and improve an initial prompt related to tool usage, while\nthe latter enables LLMs to derive the final answer by dynamically analyzing the\nproblem, cross-checking potential solutions, and revising previous reasoning\nhints in an interleaved manner. Experimental analysis shows that IMP-TIP\nachieves enhanced mathematical capabilities and outperforms traditional LLMs\nand tool-augmented LLMs in accuracy and reasoning diversity on math reasoning\ntasks. For instance, IMP-TIP can improve Tool-augmented ChatGPT on GSM8K-Hard\nfrom 56.0% to 65.2%.\n",

This paper deals with a new perspective on using such algebras as a\ntheoretical framework in classical cryptography and music theory. It is proved\nthat some block cyphers define labeled Brauer configuration algebras.\nParticularly, the dimension of the BCA associated with a ciphertext-only attack\nof the Vigenere cryptosystem is given by the corresponding key's length and the\ncaptured ciphertext's coincidence index. On the other hand, historically,\nBach's canons have been considered solved music puzzles. However, due to how\nBach posed such canons, the question remains whether their solutions are only\nlimited to musical issues. This paper gives alternative solutions based on the\ntheory of Brauer configuration algebras to some of the puzzle canons proposed\nby Bach in his Musical Offering (BWV 1079) and the canon \\^a 4 Voc: Perpetuus\n(BWV 1073). Specifically to the canon \\^a 6 Voc (BWV 1076), canon 1 \\^a2 (also\nknown as the crab canon), and canon \\^a4 Quaerendo Invenietis. These solutions\nare obtained by interpreting such canons as ciphertexts (via route and\ntransposition cyphers) of some specialized Brauer messages. In particular, it\nis noted that the structure or form of the notes used in such canons can be\ndescribed via the shape of the most used symbols in Bach's works.\n",

The goals are to clarify the relationships between\nprimitives, foundations, and deductive practice; to understand how to determine\nwhat is, or isn't, a foundation; and get clues as to how a foundation can be\noptimized for effective human use.\n  For this we turn to history and professional practice of the subject. We have\nno asperations to Philosophy.\n  The first section gives a short abstract discussion, focusing on the\nsignificance of consistency. The next briefly describes foundations, explicit\nand implicit, at a few key periods in mathematical history. We see, for\nexample, that at the primitive level human intuitions are essential, but can be\nproblematic. We also see that traditional axiomatic set theories,\nZermillo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) in particular, are not quite consistent with\nmainstream practice. The final section sketches the proposed new foundation and\ngives the basic argument that it is uniquely qualified to be considered {the}\nfoundation of mainstream deductive mathematics. The ``coherent limit axiom''\ncharacterizes the new theory among ZFC-like theories. This axiom plays a role\nin recursion, but is implicitly assumed in mainstream work so does not provide\nnew leverage there. In principle it should settle set-theory questions such as\nthe continuum hypothesis.\n",

We discuss the generalization of the trick for\nother second-order recurrences. We show that a similar trick exists for\nPell-like sequences and does not exist for Jacobhstal-like sequences.\n",

        "summary": "  In 1955, Paul Lorenzen is a mathematician who devotes all his research to\nfoundations of mathematics, on a par with Hans Hermes, but his academic\nbackground is algebra in the tradition of Helmut Hasse and Wolfgang Krull. This\nshift from algebra to logic goes along with his discovery that his ``algebraic\nworks [...] have been concerned with a problem that has formally the same\nstructure as the problem of consistency of the classical calculus of logic''\n(letter to Carl Friedrich Gethmann dated 14 January 1988). After having\nprovided a proof of consistency for arithmetic in 1944 and published it in\n1951, Lorenzen inquires still further into the foundations of mathematics and\narrives at the conviction that analysis can also be given a predicative\nfoundation. Wilhelm Ackermann as well as Paul Bernays have pointed out to him\nin 1947 that his views are very close to those proposed by Hermann Weyl in Das\nKontinuum (1918): sets are not postulated to exist beforehand; they are being\ngenerated in an ongoing process of comprehension. This seems to be the reason\nfor Lorenzen to get into contact with Weyl, who develops a genuine interest\ninto Lorenzen's operative mathematics and welcomes with great enthusiasm his\nEinf{\\\"u}hrung in die operative Logik und Mathematik (1955), which he studies\nline by line. This book's aim is to grasp the objects of analysis by means of\ninductive definitions; the most famous achievement of this enterprise is a\ngeneralised inductive formulation of the Cantor-Bendixson theorem that makes it\nconstructive. This mathematical kinship is brutally interrupted by Weyl's death\nin 1955; a planned visit by Lorenzen at the Institute for Advanced Study in\nPrinceton takes place only in 1957--1958. As told by Kuno Lorenz, Lorenzen's\nfirst Ph.D. student, a discussion with Alfred Tarski during this visit provokes\na turmoil in Lorenzen's operative research program that leads to his\nabandonment of language levels and to a great simplification of his\npresentation of analysis by distinguishing only between ``definite'' and\n``indefinite'' quantifiers: the former govern domains for which a proof of\nconsistency is available and secures the use of the law of excluded middle; the\nlatter govern those for which there isn't, e.g. the real numbers. Lorenzen\nstates in his foreword to Differential und Integral (1965) that he is faithful\nto Weyl's approach of Das Kontinuum in this simplification. This history\nmotivates a number of mathematical and philosophical issues about predicative\nmathematics: how does Weyl's interest into Lorenzen's operative mathematics fit\nwith his turn to Brouwer's intuitionism as expressed in ``{\\\"U}ber die neue\nGrundlagenkrise der Mathematik'' (1921)? Why does Lorenzen turn away from his\nlanguage levels and how does this turn relate to Weyl's conception of\npredicative mathematics? What do Lorenzen's conceptions of mathematics reveal\nabout Weyl's conceptions?\n",

Weyl interacted with physics in two highly productive phases\nand contributed to it, among others, by his widely read book on {\\em Space -\nTime - Matter (Raum Zeit - Materie)} (1918 -- 1923) and on {\\em Group Theory\nand Quantum Mechanics (Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik)} (1928 - 1931). In\nthis time Weyl's understanding of the constitution of matter and its\nmathematical description changed considerably. At the beginning of the period\nhe started from a \"dynamistic\" and geometrical conception of matter, following\nand extending the Mie-Hilbert approch, which he gave up during the year 1920.\nAfter transitional experiments with a singularity (and in this sense\ntopological) approach in 1921/22, he developed an open perspective of what he\ncalled an ``agency theory'' of matter. The idea for it was formulated already\nbefore the advent of the ``new'' quantum mechanics in 1925/26. It turned out to\nbe well suited to be taken over to the quantum view as a kind of ``heritage''\nfrom the first half of the decade. At the end of the period, Weyl completely\nrenounced his earlier belief in the possibility to ``construct matter'' from a\ngeometrically unified field theory. He now posed the possibility of a\ngeometrization of the mathematical forms underlying the rising quantum physical\ndescription of matter as a completely open problem for future research.\n",

In his outstanding 1868 paper Beltrami discussed how non-Euclidean\ngeometry is actually realized and displayed in a disk on the plane. This metric\nis intrinsically defined and definite but only if indefinite metrics are\nintroduced it is possible to fully understand the structure of pseudospheres.\nIn a 3D flat space R^3 the fundamental quadric is introduced, with the same\nsignature as the metric of R^3; this leads to 3 kinds of surfaces with constant\nGaussian curvature: the sphere, the single-sheet hyperboloid and the two-sheet\nhyperboloid; the last one is shown to be isomorphic to Beltrami's disk. The\nspacetime corresponding to the single-sheet case is de Sitter cosmological\nmodel, which, due to its symmetry, has an important role in cosmology. When two\nof the three fundamental quadrics are combined, a simple, yet deep, solution of\nEinstein-Maxwell equations corresponding to a uniform electromagnetic field is\nobtained with many applications in mathematical physics. One of them is a \"no\ngo\" theorem: when one tries to frame a Riemannian four-dimensional manifold in\na Kahlerian structure, it is found that, while this is generically possible\nwith a definite signature, in spacetime only BR fulfills the requirement. The\nBR metric plays an important role in the exploration of new principles in\nfundamental physical theories; we briefly mention some examples related to the\nhorizon of a black hole and the dilaton in string theory.\n",

In particular, I emphasize the often neglected\npoint that degrees of beliefs are updated not by `bare facts' alone, but by all\navailable information pertaining to them, including how they have been\nacquired. In this light I show that, contrary to what claimed in that article,\nthere was no \"probabilistic pitfall\" in the Columbo's episode pointed as\nexample of \"bad mathematics\" yielding \"rough justice\". Instead, such a\ncriticism could have a `negative reaction' to the article itself and to the use\nof Bayesian reasoning in courts, as well as in all other places in which\nprobabilities need to be assessed and decisions need to be made. Anyway,\nbesides introductory/recreational aspects, the paper touches important\nquestions, like: role and evaluation of priors; subjective evaluation of Bayes\nfactors; role and limits of intuition; `weights of evidence' and `intensities\nof beliefs' (following Peirce) and `judgments leaning' (here introduced),\nincluding their uncertainties and combinations; role of relative frequencies to\nassess and express beliefs; pitfalls due to `standard' statistical education;\nweight of evidences mediated by testimonies.

In\nparticular, by analysing, both systematically and in historical context, a\nhitherto unpublished letter written in 1941 by John von Neumann to Stanislaw\nUlam, this paper clarifies von Neumann's contribution to discovering the\nrelationship between spatial isomorphism and spectral isomorphism. The main\nmessage of the paper is that von Neumann's argument described in his letter to\nUlam is the very first proof that spatial isomorphism and spectral isomorphism\nare not equivalent because spectral isomorphism is weaker than spatial\nisomorphism: von Neumann shows that spectrally isomorphic ergodic dynamical\nsystems with mixed spectra need not be spatially isomorphic.\n",

This is the case for\nmodels in Amboise (France), Chicago and Portland (USA), Florence (Italy) and\nfor the one of the traveling exhibition by the Australian company 'Grande\nExhibitions' that already visited 40 major cities in the world. All 'replicas'\nof the bridge model attributed to Leonardo have pillars standing on the deck of\nthe bridge, while the deck is suspended by cables attached on these pillars. At\nfirst sight this problem does not catch the attention of the observer, as the\nbridge seems to be a mixed form of a beam and a suspension bridge, but it was\nnot overlooked by my colleague architect-engineer Dr. Laurens Luyten (Gent,\nBelgium). Yet, after a TV-interview in Brussels so much pressure was exerted by\nsome of the museum collaborators, the architect prefers to keep the silence\nabout the engineering by these 'scientific' exhibitions. Yet, it is the\nauthor's opinion the ridiculous models do not honor Leonardo, and so the\npresent paper takes up the challenge to report about his observation in his\nname (with his permission).

Cauchy found a Lagrangian formulation of 3D ideal\nincompressible flow in terms of three invariants that generalize to three\ndimensions the now well-known law of conservation of vorticity along fluid\nparticle trajectories for two-dimensional flow. This has very recently been\nused to prove analyticity in time of fluid particle trajectories for 3D\nincompressible Euler flow and can be extended to compressible flow, in\nparticular to cosmological dark matter. Hankel showed that Cauchy's formulation\ngives a very simple Lagrangian derivation of the Helmholtz vorticity-flux\ninvariants and, in the middle of the proof, derived an intermediate result\nwhich is the conservation of the circulation of the velocity around a closed\ncontour moving with the fluid. This circulation theorem was to be rediscovered\nindependently by William Thomson (Kelvin) in 1869. Cauchy's invariants were\nonly occasionally cited in the 19th century --- besides Hankel, foremost by\nGeorge Stokes and Maurice L\\'evy --- and even less so in the 20th until they\nwere rediscovered via Emmy Noether's theorem in the late 1960, but reattributed\nto Cauchy only at the end of the 20th century by Russian scientists.\n",

This paper\naddresses the following question: What if team A wants to game the system? Can\nit gain an advantage by putting its players in a different order?\n  The first example of this problem in history (to the author's knowledge) was\na match of three horse races between the King of Qi and general Tian Ji, in\nChina, in the fourth century B.C. Tian Ji's protege, Sun Bin, advised the\ngeneral to throw the first race, running his #3 horse against the king's #1,\nand then to race his #1 horse against the king's #2 and his #2 horse against\nthe king's #3. In this way, Tian Ji won the match, 2-1, and Sun Bin ensured his\nreputation as a great strategist.\n  The paper introduces a card-game version of this puzzle, called One Round\nWar, and derives the optimal strategy in case each side has N cards (the\nanalogue of N horses). The problem is recast as a linear assignment problem.\nThe optimal solution involves sacrificing the weakest k cards/horses (for some\nk = k(N)) against the opponent's strongest k in reverse order (weakest vs.\nstrongest), and then playing the remaining N-k cards/horses against the\nopponent's remaining cards in forward order. An exact formula is derived for\nk(N), and asymptotically we show that k(N) ~ sqrt (N ln N/2).\n  Note: This paper proves that the strategy described above is optimal for\nsufficiently large N (e.g., for N greater than 10^7). It has also been verified\nby computer to be optimal for N less than 60. We conjecture that it is also\ntrue for N between 60 and 10^7. The upper bound 10^7 can be greatly improved,\nbut closing the gap completely will probably require computer calculations that\nare beyond our resources.\n",

Halmos' scepticism about\ncategory theory derives from his philosophical position of naive set-theoretic\nrealism. In the words of an MAA biography, Halmos thought that mathematics is\n\"certainty\" and \"architecture\" yet 20th century logic teaches us is that\nmathematics is full of uncertainty or more precisely incompleteness. If the\nterm architecture meant to imply that mathematics is one great solid castle,\nthen modern logic tends to teach us the opposite lession, namely that the\ncastle is floating in midair. Halmos' realism tends to color his judgment of\npurely scientific aspects of logic and the way it is practiced and applied. He\noften expressed distaste for nonstandard models, and made a sustained effort to\neliminate first-order logic, the logicians' concept of interpretation, and the\nsyntactic vs semantic distinction. He felt that these were vague, and sought to\nreplace them all by his polyadic algebra. Halmos claimed that Robinson's\nframework is \"unnecessary\" but Henson and Keisler argue that Robinson's\nframework allows one to dig deeper into set-theoretic resources than is common\nin Archimedean mathematics. This can potentially prove theorems not accessible\nby standard methods, undermining Halmos' criticisms.\n  Keywords: Archimedean axiom; bridge between discrete and continuous\nmathematics; hyperreals; incomparable quantities; indispensability; infinity;\nmathematical realism; Robinson.\n",

In this paper the fairy tale which gives the name to the book is\nanalyzed in a dialog between three teachers with different background and\nexpertise. The outcomes are definitively discouraging, especially when the\nstory is compared to the appendix of the book, in which the teaching power of\nevery story is indeed explained (as a matter of fact, without the appendix the\nfairy tale of the witches seemed to be written with the purpose of make the\n'Bayesians', meant as the villagers from 'Bayes', ridiculous). In fact the\nfairy tale of the witches does not contain any Bayesian reasoning, the\nsuggested decision strategy is simply wrong and the story does not even seem to\nbe easily modifiable (besides the trivial correction of the decision strategy)\nin order to make it usable as a teaching tool. As it happens in real dialogues,\nbesides the fairy tale in question, the dialogue touches several issues somehow\nrelated to the story and concerning probability, inference, prediction and\ndecision making. The present paper is an indirect response to the invitation by\nthe ISBA bulletin to comment on the fairy tale.\n",

The aim\nof this article is to propose on the one hand a brief history of modeling\nstarting from the works of Fibonacci, Robert Malthus, Pierre Francis Verhulst\nand then Vito Volterra and, on the other hand, to present the main hypotheses\nof the very famous but very little known predator-prey model elaborated in the\n1920s by Volterra in order to solve a problem posed by his son-in-law, Umberto\nD'Ancona. It is thus shown that, contrary to a widely-held notion, Volterra's\nmodel is realistic and his seminal work laid the groundwork for modern\npopulation dynamics and mathematical ecology, including seasonality, migration,\npollution and more. 1. A short history of modeling 1.1. The Malthusian model.\nIf the rst scientic view of population growth seems to be that of Leonardo\nFibonacci [2], also called Leonardo of Pisa, whose famous sequence of numbers\nwas presented in his Liber abaci (1202) as a solution to a population growth\nproblem, the modern foundations of population dynamics clearly date from Thomas\nRobert Malthus [20]. Considering an ideal population consisting of a single\nhomogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and\nany periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable\nenvironment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect\ninuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when\nunchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential\ngrowth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of\nindividuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is\nproportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation :\n(1) dN (t) dt = $\\epsilon$N (t) where $\\epsilon$ is a constant factor of\nproportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By\nintegrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian\ngrowth (see Fig. 1). This law, which does not take into account the limits\nimposed by the environment on growth and which is in disagreement with the\nactual facts, had a profound inuence on Charles Darwin's work on natural\nselection. Indeed, Darwin [1] founded the idea of survival of the ttest on the\n1. According to Frontier and Pichod-Viale [3] the correct terminology should be\npopulation kinetics, since the interaction between species cannot be\nrepresented by forces. 2. A population is dened as the set of individuals of\nthe same species living on the same territory and able to reproduce among\nthemselves.\n",

It has\nbeen extended by Brahmagupta to quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle (cyclic\nquadrilaterals). A natural problem is trying to further generalize the result\nto cyclic polygons with a larger number of edges, which, surprisingly, has\nrevealed to be far from simple. In this paper we investigate such a problem by\nfollowing a new and elementary approach. We start from the simple observation\nthat the incircle of a right triangle touches its hypothenuse in a point that\nsplits it into two segments, the product of whose lengths equals the area of\nthe triangle. From this curious fact we derive in a few lines: an unusual proof\nof the Pythagoras' theorem, Heron's theorem for right triangles, Heron's\ntheorem for general triangles, and Brahmagupta's theorem for cyclic\nquadrangles. This suggests that cutting the edges of a cyclic polygon by means\nof suitable points should be the \"right\" working method. Indeed, following this\nidea, we obtain an explicit formula for the area of any convex cyclic polygon,\nas a symmetric function of the segments split on its edges by the incircles of\na triangulation. We also show that such a symmetry can be rediscovered in\nHeron's and Brahmagupta's results, which consequently represent special cases\nof the general provided formula.\n",

He applied it to estimate harmonic series partial sums, the\ngamma constant, and sums of logarithms, thereby calculating large factorials\n(Stirling's series) with ease. He even commented that his approximation of $\n\\pi $ was surprisingly accurate for so little work.

When\nEuclid lay down the foundations of mathematics, his formulation of geometry\nreflected the surrounding space, as humans perceive it. For about two\nmillennia, it remained unclear whether there are alternative geometric spaces\nthat carry their own, unique mathematical properties and that do not reflect\nhuman every-day perceptions. Finally, in the early 19th century, several\nmathematicians described such geometries, which do not follow Euclid's rules\nand which were at first interesting solely from a pure mathematical point of\nview. These descriptions were not very accessible as mathematicians approached\nthe geometries via complicated collections of formulae. Within the following\ndecades, visualization aided the new concepts and two-dimensional versions of\nthese illustrations even appeared in artistic works. Furthermore, certain\naspects of Einstein's theory of relativity provided applications for\nnon-Euclidean geometric spaces.

Their knowledge is essential for\nthe proper handling and understanding of current problems in physics.

Concretely, the flatness property means that a small patch of the\nsurface around any point can be flattened to a patch of the plane without\nstretching or compressing. Thus we can use the medium of curved-crease origami\nwith inelastic film to make a model which, except for its self-intersections,\nnecessarily has the flatness property, even along its folded edges. As such,\nthe sculpture presented here illustrates both the flatness, and, through its\ncoloring, the non-orientability of a Klein bottle.\n",

General physicalized laws of\nmathematics are discussed, associated with concepts such as metamathematical\nmotion, inevitable dualities, proof topology and metamathematical\nsingularities. It is argued that mathematics as currently practiced can be\nviewed as derived from the ruliad in a direct Platonic fashion analogous to our\nexperience of the physical world, and that axiomatic formulation, while often\nconvenient, does not capture the ultimate character of mathematics. Among the\nimplications of this view is that only certain collections of axioms may be\nconsistent with inevitable features of human mathematical observers.

This paper proposes\ncombining a rank one approximation and latent semantic indexing to a matrix\nrepresenting the list of all possible solutions. Rank one approximation finds\nthe dominant eigenvector of a matrix of words, and latent semantic indexing\nreveals which word is closest to the dominant eigenvector. The word whose\ncolumn vector is closest to the dominant eigenvector is chosen as the next\nguess. With this method the most representative word of the set of all possible\nsolutions is selected. This paper describes how a word can be converted to a\nvector and the theory behind a rank one approximation and latent semantic\nindexing.

From these measurements, one can identify the directions of largest and\nsmallest curvature, i.e. the principal curvatures, and construct two surface\ninvariants by taking the average and the product of the principal curvatures.\nThe product of the principal curvatures describes the intrinsic curvature of a\nsurface, and has profound importance in differential geometry - evidenced by\nthe Gauss's Theorema Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. This curvature is\ncommonly referred to as the Gaussian Curvature after Carl Friedrich Gauss,\nfollowing his significant contributions to the emerging field of differential\ngeometry in his 1828 work. The average, or mean curvature, is an extrinsic\nmeasure of the shape of a surface - that is, the shape must be embedded in a\nhigher dimensional space to be measured. Beginning in 1811, and culminating in\nefforts in 1821 and 1826, the mathematician Sophie Germain identified the mean\ncurvature as the appropriate measure for describing the shape of vibrating\nplates. Her hypothesis leads directly to the equations describing the behavior\nof thin, elastic plates. In letters to Gauss, she described her notion of a\n\"sphere of mean curvature\" that can be identified at each point on the surface.\nThis contribution stimulated a period of rapid development in elasticity and\ngeometry, and yet Germain has not yet received due credit for deducing the\nmathematical and physical significance of mean curvature. It is clear from the\nprimary source evidence that this measure of mean curvature should bear the\nname of Sophie Germain.\n",

From the latter to the former, Stephen Hilmy's (\\emph{The Later\nWittgenstein}, 1987) extensive study of the \\emph{Nachlass} has helped removing\nclassical misconceptions such as Hintikka's claim that ``Wittgenstein in the\n\\emph{Philosophical Investigations} almost completely gave up the calculus\nanalogy.\" Hilmy points out that even in the \\emph{Investigations} one finds the\nuse of the calculus/game paradigm to the understanding of language, such as\n``in operating with the word\" (Part I, \\S 559) and ``it plays a different part\nin the calculus\". Hilmy also quotes from a late (1946) unpublished manuscript\n(MS 130) ``this sentence has use in the calculus of language\"), which seems to\nbe compatible with ``asking whether and how a proposition can be verified is\nonly a particular way of asking `How do you mean?'.\" Central in this back and\nforth there is an aspect which seems to deserve attention in the discussion of\na semantics for the language of mathematics which might be based on\n(normalisation of) proofs and/or Hintikka/Lorenzen game-dialogue: the\nexplication of consequences.

In a preregistered study we collected\n$350{,}757$ coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics\nmodel of human coin tossing developed by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery (DHM;\n2007). The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to\nland on the same side it started -- DHM estimated the probability of a\nsame-side outcome to be about 51%. Our data lend strong support to this precise\nprediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not,\n$\\text{Pr}(\\text{same side}) = 0.508$, 95% credible interval (CI) [$0.506$,\n$0.509$], $\\text{BF}_{\\text{same-side bias}} = 2359$. Furthermore, the data\nrevealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side\nbias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an\nordinary coin -- with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally\nlikely to land heads or tails: $\\text{Pr}(\\text{heads}) = 0.500$, 95% CI\n[$0.498$, $0.502$], $\\text{BF}_{\\text{heads-tails bias}} = 0.182$. Furthermore,\nthis lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Additional\nexploratory analyses revealed that the within-people same-side bias decreased\nas more coins were flipped, an effect that is consistent with the possibility\nthat practice makes people flip coins in a less wobbly fashion. Our data\ntherefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a\nfair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data provide\ncompelling statistical support for the DHM physics model of coin tossing.\n",

Pure mathematics is a language game incorporating aspects of\nformalism and structuralism, modified however by a different notion of truth.\nApplied mathematics corresponds to a different language game in which\nmathematical theories provide generalized yardsticks that \"measure\" (as opposed\nto: represent) natural phenomena. Thus our framework is non-referential for\nboth pure and applied mathematics. The certainty of pure mathematics in\nprinciple resides in proofs, but in practice these must be surveyable'.

More than 20 of its reformulations are known, which\nconnect this problem with problems of algebra, statistical mechanics and\nplanning. And this is also typical for mathematics: the solution to a problem\nstudied out of pure curiosity turns out to be useful in representing real\nobjects and processes that are completely different in nature. Despite the\npublished machine methods for combinatorial proof of the Four color conjecture,\nthere is still no clear description of the mechanism for coloring a planar\ngraph with four colors, its natural essence and its connection with the\nphenomenon of graph planarity. It is necessary not only to prove (preferably by\ndeductive methods) that any planar graph can be colored with four colors, but\nalso to show how to color it. The paper considers an approach based on the\npossibility of reducing a maximally flat graph to a regular flat cubic graph\nwith its further coloring. Based on the Tate-Volynsky theorem, the vertices of\na maximally flat graph can be colored with four colors, if the edges of its\ndual cubic graph can be colored with three colors. Considering the properties\nof a colored cubic graph, it can be shown that the addition of colors obeys the\ntransformation laws of the fourth order Klein group. Using this property, it is\npossible to create algorithms for coloring planar graphs.\n",

An increasing number of mathematicians have been calling\nthis `B\\'ezout's identity', some encouraged by finding \"identit\\'e de B\\'ezout\"\nin Bourbaki's \\emph{'El\\'ements de math\\'ematique}. Moreover the observation\nthat if $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ then this is an `if and only if' condition, is sometimes\ncalled the \"Bachet-B\\'ezout theorem\".\n  However this is all in Euclid's work from around 300 B.C., when his writings\nare interpreted in context. So why does he not get credit? Some authors learned\nthe name \"B\\'ezout's identity\" and have perhaps not consulted Euclid, so copied\nthe misattribution. Others, like some Nicolas Bourbaki collaborators, have\nperhaps browsed Euclid's results, but in a form written for the modern\nmathematician, and missed out on what he really did (though certainly others,\nsuch as Weil, did not). In this article we will carefully explain what Euclid's\narguments are and what his approach was. We will also share Kowalski's guess as\nto the reasons behind Bourbaki's misnomer.\n  To appreciate Euclid, you need to read his work in context: Lengths are the\ncentral object of study to the geometer Euclid, though he brilliantly developed\nthe theory of the numbers that measured those lengths. Today's mathematicians\nread his number theory results as being about abstract numbers not\nmeasurements. However the correct interpretation changes how these results are\nperceived; Euclid's proofs make clear Euclid's intentions.\n  These misperceptions reflect recent discussions about difficulties faced by\nindigenous people when learning mathematics. We discuss how some indigenous\ngroups may learn numbers in certain practical contexts, not as abstract\nentities, and struggle when curricula assume that we all share abstract numbers\nas a basic, primary fully-absorbed working tool.\n",

A graph automorphism is a mapping of a set of vertices onto itself\nthat preserves adjacency. The set of such automorphisms forms a vertex group of\na graph or simply a graph group. The basis for constructing a group of graph\nautomorphisms is the concept of orbit. The construction of an orbit is closely\nrelated to the quantitative assessment of a vertex or edge of a graph, called\nweight. To determine the weight of an element, graph invariants built on the\nspectrum of edge cuts and the spectrum of edge cycles are used. The weight of\nthe graph elements allows identifying generating cycles and forming orbits.\nExamples are given of constructing a group of automorphisms for some types of\ngraphs.\n",

A\ngood grasp of these relies on scalar algebra learned in middle school. The\nability to understand and use scalar algebra well, in turn, relies on a good\nfoundation in basic arithmetic. Because of various systemic barriers, many\nstudents are not able to build a strong foundation in arithmetic in elementary\nschool. This leads them to struggle with algebra and everything after that.\nSince math learning is cumulative, the gap between those without a strong early\nfoundation and everyone else keeps increasing over the school years and becomes\ndifficult to fill in college. In this article we discuss how SP faculty and\ngraduate students can play an important role in starting, and participating in,\nuniversity-run (or other) out-of-school math support programs to supplement\nstudents' learning. Two example programs run by the authors (CyMath at ISU and\nAb7G at Purdue) are briefly described. The second goal of this article is to\nuse our perspective as SP, and engineering, educators who have seen the\nlong-term impact of elementary school math teaching policies, to provide some\nsimple almost zero cost suggestions that elementary schools could adopt to\nimprove math learning: (i) more math practice in school, (ii) send small\namounts of homework (individual work is critical in math), and (iii) parent\nawareness (math resources, need for early math foundation, clear in-school test\ninformation and sharing of feedback from the tests). In summary, good early\nmath support (in school and through out-of-school programs) can help make SP\nand ML more accessible.\n",

In the 1980s, within the\nframework of research into mathematical models on the parallel processing of\nneural systems, a group of operators emerged -- neurally inspired and based on\nmatrix algebra -- which computed logical operations automatically. These matrix\noperators reproduce the order of operators and variables of Polish notation.\nThese logical matrices can also generate a three-valued logic with broad\nsimilarities to Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic. In this paper, a parallel is\ndrawn between relevant formulas represented in Polish notation, and their\ncounterparts in terms of neurally based matrix operators. Lukasiewicz's\nthree-valued logic, shown in Polish notation has several points of contact with\nwhat matrices produce when they process uncertain truth vectors.

This\narticle offers an insight into his results in geometry, algebra and number\ntheory.\n  Related to geometry, his classical algorithm is reviewed as an index\nreduction of a polar form. This idea is used to show de Casteljau's algebraic\nway of smoothing, which long went unnoticed. We will also see an analytic polar\nform and its use in finding the intersection of two curves. The article\nsummarises unpublished material on metric geometry. It includes theoretical\nadvances, e.g., the 14-point strophoid or a way to link Apollonian circles with\nconfocal conics, and also practical applications such as a recurrence for\nconjugate mirrors in geometric optics. A view on regular polygons leads to an\napproximation of their diagonals by golden matrices, a generalisation of the\ngolden ratio.\n  Relevant algebraic findings include matrix quaternions (and anti-quaternions)\nand their link with Lorentz' equations. De Casteljau generalised the Euclidean\nalgorithm and developed an automated method for approximating the roots of a\nclass of polynomial equations. His contributions to number theory not only\ninclude aspects on the sum of four squares as in quaternions, but also a view\non a particular sum of three cubes. After a review of a complete quadrilateral\nin a heptagon and its angles, the paper concludes with a summary of de\nCasteljau's key achievements.\n  The article contains a comprehensive bibliography of de Casteljau's works,\nincluding previously unpublished material.\n",
