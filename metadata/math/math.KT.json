One of these presentations suggests a homological\ninterpretation, and so a complex is introduced whose 0-dimensional homology is\nnaturally isomorphic to $K_0 (R-mod, \\oplus).$ A computation shows that if R =\nk is a field, then the 1-dimensional homology group is given by the\nabelianization of the multiplicative group of k, modulo the subgroup {1, -1}.\n  The formal matrix calculus, which consists of three rules of matrix\noperation, is the syntax of a deductive system whose completeness was proved by\nPrest. The three rules of inference of this deductive system correspond to the\nthree rules of matrix operation, which appear in the formal matrix calculus as\nthe Rules of Divisibility.\n",

The second \"Local\" refers\nto the cyclic homology localised to a certain separable subring of the ground\nalgebra, while the last one refers to Alexander-Spanier type cyclic homology.\nThe Connes-Moscovici work is based on the operator $R(A) = \\mathbf{P} -\n\\mathbf{e}$ associated to the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $A$ on the\nsmooth manifold $M$, where $\\mathbf{P}$, $\\mathbf{e}$ are idempotents, see\n\\cite{Connes-Moscovici1}, Pg. 353. The operator $R(A)$ has two main merits: it\nis a smoothing operator and its distributional kernel is situated in an\narbitrarily small neighbourhood of the diagonal in $M \\times M$. The operator\n$R(A)$ has also two setbacks: -i) it is not an idempotent (and therefore it\ndoes not have a genuine Connes-Chern character); -ii) even if it were an\nidempotent, its Connes-Chern character would belong to the cyclic homology of\nthe algebra of smoothing operators (with \\emph{arbitrary} supports, which is\n\\emph{trivial}. This paper presents a new solution to the difficulties raised\nby the two setbacks. For which concerns -i), we show that although $R(A)$ is\nnot an idempotent, it satisfies the identity $ (\\mathbf{R}(A))^{2} \\;=\\;\n\\mathbf{R}(A) - [\\mathbf{R}(A) . e + e .\\mathbf{R}(A) ]. $ We show that the\noperator $R(A)$ has a genuine Chern character provided the cyclic homology\ncomplex of the algebra of smoothing operators is \\emph{localised} to the\nseparable sub-algebra $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{C} + \\mathbb{C} . e$, see Sect. 8.1.\nFor which concerns -ii), we introduce the notion of \\emph{local} cyclic\nhomology; this is constructed on the foot-steps of the Alexander-Spanier\nhomology, i.e. by filtering the chains of the cyclic homology complex of the\nalgebra of smoothing operators by their distributional support, see Sect. 7.\nUsing these new instruments, we give a reformulation of the Connes-Moscovici\nlocal Index Theorem, see Theorem 23, Sect. 9. As a corollary of this theorem,\nwe show that the \\emph{local} cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing\noperators is at least as big as the Alexander-Spanier homology of the base\nmanifold. The present reformulation of Connes-Moscovici local index theorem\nopens the way to new investigations, see Sect. 10.\n",

Priddy. Our definition is in some sense as closest as\npossible to the one given in the homogeneous case. Indeed, we give an\nequivalent description of the new definition in terms of the \\textrm{Tor} (or\n\\textrm{Ext}) groups, similar to the existing one for homogeneous algebras, and\nalso a complete characterization of the multi-Koszul property, which derives\nfrom the study of some associated homogeneous algebras, providing a very strong\nlink between the new definition and the generalized Koszul property for the\nassociated homogeneous algebras mentioned before. We further obtain an explicit\ndescription of the Yoneda algebra of a multi-Koszul algebra. As a consequence,\nwe get that the Yoneda algebra of a multi-Koszul algebra is generated in\ndegrees 1 and 2, so a $\\mathcal{K}_{2}$ algebra in the sense of T. Cassidy and\nB. Shelton. We also exhibit several examples and we provide a minimal graded\nprojective resolution of the algebra $A$ considered as an $A$-bimodule, which\nmay be used to compute the Hochschild (co)homology groups. Finally, we find\nnecessary and sufficient conditions on some (fixed) sequences of vector\nsubspaces of the tensor powers of the base space $V$ to obtain in this case the\nmulti-Koszul property in the case we have relations in only two degrees.\n",

Rosenberg [KR] proposed a heuristic\nprinciple according to which the family of schemes ${Rep_n(A)}$ parametrizing\nthe finite-dimensional represen- tations of a noncommutative algebra A should\nbe thought of as a substitute or \"approximation\" for Spec(A). The idea is that\nevery property or noncommutative geometric structure on A should induce a\ncorresponding geometric property or structure on $Rep_n(A)$ for all n. In\nrecent years, many interesting structures in noncommutative geometry have\noriginated from this idea. In practice, however, if an associative algebra A\npossesses a property of geometric nature (e.g., A is a NC complete\nintersection, Cohen-Macaulay, Calabi-Yau, etc.), it often happens that, for\nsome n, the scheme $Rep_n(A)$ fails to have the corresponding property in the\nusual algebro-geometric sense. The reason for this seems to be that the\nrepresentation functor $Rep_n$ is not \"exact\" and should be replaced by its\nderived functor $DRep_n$ (in the sense of non-abelian homological algebra). The\nhigher homology of $DRep_n(A)$, which we call representation homology,\nobstructs $Rep_n(A)$ from having the desired property and thus measures the\nfailure of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg \"approximation.\" In this paper, which is\nmostly a survey, we prove several results confirming this intuition. We also\ngive a number of examples and explicit computations illustrating the theory\ndeveloped in [BKR] and [BR].\n",

The first results results obtained in this project were announced at\nthe International Conference on Non-commutative Geometry, Trieste, November\n2007.

The unifying idea behind our program is to localise K-theory and the\nnon-commutative geometry basic tools (Hochschild, cyclic homology and\nco-homology, Connes-Karoubi Chern character) along the lines of\nAlexander-Spanier co-homology and homology. The motivation for the realisation\nof this programme is four-fold: -1) the classical Atiyah-Singer type index\nformula is a global statement with local controle, -2) the non-localised\nexisting tools are not fine enough to capture sufficient information in the\ncase of Banach algebras, -3) one wants to make so that the Alexander-Spanier\n(co)-homology becomes a natural ingredient of non-commutative geometry and -4)\nthe Alexander-Spanier co-homology, with respect to the existing non-commutative\ngeometry tools, has the advantage that it does need extra regularity beyond the\nordinary topology.

The group\n$K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is by definition the quotient of\n$\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ modulo the equivalence relation generated by:\n-1) stabilisation $\\sim_{s}$, --2) local conjugation $\\sim_{l}$ and -3)\n$\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$, where $\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is\nthe sub-module generated by elements of the form $ u \\oplus u^{-1} $, for any\n$u \\in \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$. The class of any invertible element $u$\nmodulo conjugation (inner auto-morphisms) we call the Jordan canonical form of\n$u$. The local conjugation preserves the local Jordan canonical form of\ninvertible elements. The equivalence relation\n$\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$ insures existence of opposite elements in\n$K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ and $K_{1}^{loc}(\\mathit{A})$. Our definition of\n$K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ does not use the commutator sub-group\n$[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$ nor elementary matrices in\nits construction. We define short exact sequences of localised algebras. To get\nthe corresponding (open) six terms exact sequence (Theorem 51) one has to take\nthe tensor product of the expected six terms exact sequence by\n$\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}]$. We expect the factor\n$\\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}}]$ to have important consequences. Our work\nshows that the basic structure of $K_{1}$ resides in the {\\em additive}\nsub-group generated by elements of the form $u \\oplus u^{-1}$, $u \\in\n\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})$, rather than in the {\\em multiplicativ} commutator\nsub-group $[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$. Even into the\ncase of trivially filtered algebras, $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu} = \\mathit{A}$, for all\n$\\mu \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the introduced group $K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ should\nprovide more information than the classical group $K_{1}(\\mathit{A})$.\n",

Index theory should be done: Case 1: for\narbitrary rings, Case 2: for rings of functions over topo- logical manifolds.\nCase 1 produces general index theorems, as for example, over pseudo-manifolds.\nCase 2 gives a general treatment of classical and non- commutative index\ntheorems. All existing index theorems belong to the second category. The tools\nof the theory would contain: local $T^{\\ast}$ -theory, local peri- odic cyclic\nhomology, local Chern character. These tools are extended to non- commutative\ntopology. The index formula has three stages : Stage I is done in\n$T^{loc}\\_{i}$-theory, Stage II is done in the local periodic cyclic homology\nand Stage III involves products of distributions, or restriction to the\ndiagonal. For each stage there corresponds a topological index and an\nanalytical index. The construction of $T^{\\ast}$-theory involves the\nT-completion. It involves also the need to work with half integers; this should\nhave important consequences.\n",

The new properties can be defined in the general\ncontext of coarse metric geometry and are coarse invariants. In particular,\nthey are quasi-isometry invariants of spaces and groups. We show that coarse\nregular coherence implies weak regular coherence, a weakening of regular\ncoherence by G. Carlsson and the first author.

However, all groups known to be weakly regular\ncoherent are also coarsely regular coherent. The new framework allows us to\nprove structural results by developing permanence properties, including the\nparticularly important fibering permanence property, for coarse regular\ncoherence.\n",

Since such\nrepresentatives are vital in applications of duality, we supply such a cycle in\nunbounded form in this article. Our approach is to construct, for any\nnon-trivial element $g$ of the modular group, a finitely generated projective\nmodule $\\mathcal{L}_g$ over $A_\\theta \\otimes A_\\theta$ by using a\nreduction-to-a-transversal argument of Muhly, Renault, and Williams, applied to\na pair of Kronecker foliations along lines of slope $\\theta$ and $g(\\theta)$,\nusing the fact that these flows are transverse to each other.

Using the\nBaum-Connes conjecture, we can transfer computations in Bredon homology to\nobtain a Hecke action on the $K$-theory of the reduced $C^{*}$-algebra of the\ngroup. We show the power of this method giving explicit computations for the\ngroup $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}[i])$.

Then the unstable E-infinite extension theorem states how\nadjacent filtration quotients of the colimit filtration are extended by\n$E^{\\infty}$ objects over corresponding adjacent filtration quotients of the\nkernel filtration.\n  The stable E-infinity extension theorem is based on the fact that the\nderivation process of the exact couple admits a transfinite recursion which is\nbeyond the scope of the traditional spectral sequence perspective. The\ntransfinite recursion always stabilizes at some ordinal.

The main idea\nof the present paper is to use similar tools as developed by Farnsteiner for\nHochschild cohomology to work around this. Unfortunately, it does not seem to\nbe possible to relate the cohomology of a Leibniz algebra directly to\nHochschild cohomology as is the case for Lie algebras, but all the desired\nresults can be obtained in a similar way. In particular, this enables us to\ngeneralize the vanishing theorems of Dixmier and Barnes for nilpotent and\n(super)solvable Lie algebras to Leibniz algebras. Moreover, we compute the\ncohomology of the one-dimensional Lie algebra with values in an arbitrary\nLeibniz bimodule and show that it is periodic with period two.

Vice versa, in many situations,\nwe show that the failure $E$ of sending a pullback square to a pullback is\ncontrolled by the value of $E$ on a pushout of ring spectra.\n  The latter can be interpreted as identifying the $\\odot$-ring, introduced in\nearlier work of ours, as a pushout which turns out to be explicitly computable\nin many cases. This opens up new possibilities for direct computations. As\nfurther applications, we give new proofs of (generalizations) of Waldhausen's\nseminal results on the $K$-theory of generalized free products and obtain a\ngeneral relation between the value of a localizing invariant on trivial square\nzero extensions and on tensor algebras.\n",

These groups satisfy the usual properties of the\nequivariant $K$-theory groups, but also some new phenomena arise due to the\ntopological non-triviality of the bundle $\\GR \\to B$. As an application, we\ndefine a gauge-equivariant index for a family of elliptic operators $(P_b)_{b\n\\in B}$ invariant with respect to the action of $\\GR \\to B$, which, in this\napproach, is an element of $K_\\GR^0(B)$. We then give another definition of the\ngauge-equivariant index as an element of $K_0(C^*(\\GR))$, the $K$-theory group\nof the Banach algebra $C^*(\\GR)$. We prove that $K_0(C^*(\\GR)) \\simeq\nK^0_\\GR(\\GR)$ and that the two definitions of the gauge-equivariant index are\nequivalent. The algebra $C^*(\\GR)$ is the algebra of continuous sections of a\ncertain field of $C^*$-algebras with non-trivial Dixmier-Douady invariant. The\ngauge-equivariant $K$-theory groups are thus examples of twisted $K$-theory\ngroups, which have recently proved themselves useful in the study of\nRamond-Ramond fields.\n",

Guoliang Yu proved that the $K$-theory assembly map \\[\nH_*^G(\\cE(G,\\vcyc),K(\\cS))\\to K_*(\\cS[G]) \\] is rationally injective. His proof\ninvolves the construction of a certain Chern character tailored to work with\ncoefficients $\\cS$ and the use of some results about algebraic $K$-theory of\noperator ideals and about controlled topology and coarse geometry. In this\npaper we give a different proof of Yu's result. Our proof uses the usual Chern\ncharacter to cyclic homology. Like Yu's, it relies on results on algebraic\n$K$-theory of operator ideals, but no controlled topology or coarse geometry\ntechniques are used. We formulate the result in terms of homotopy $K$-theory.\nWe prove that the rational assembly map \\[\nH_*^G(\\cE(G,\\fin),KH(\\cL^p))\\otimes\\Q\\to KH_*(\\cL^p[G])\\otimes\\Q \\] is\ninjective. We show that the latter map is equivalent to the assembly map\nconsidered by Yu, and thus obtain his result as a corollary.\n",

This topological Chern map provides a natural candidate for the\nexistence of a rational structure on the periodic cylic homology of a smooth\nproper dg-algebra, within the theory of noncommutative Hodge structures. The\ndefinition of topological K-theory consists in two steps : taking the\ntopological realization of algebraic K-theory, and inverting the Bott element.\nThe topological realization is the left Kan extension of the functor \"space of\ncomplex points\" to all simplicial presheaves over complex algebraic varieties.\nOur first main result states that the topological K-theory of the unit\ndg-category is the spectrum BU. For this we are led to prove a homotopical\ngeneralization of Deligne's cohomological proper descent, using Lurie's proper\ndescent. The fact that the Chern character descends to topological K-theory is\nestablished by using Kassel's K\\\"unneth formula for periodic cyclic homology\nand once again the proper descent result. In the case of a dg-category of\nperfect complexes on a smooth scheme, we show that we recover the usual\ntopological K-theory. Finally in the case of a finite dimensional associative\nalgebra, we show that the lattice conjecture holds.

As a consequence, the\n$K$-homology element defined by $[M,E,\\phi]$ represents a class of D-brane\nconfigurations that have the same physical charge.

The lack of an adequate projectivity condition on our\ndifferentiable module entails that the usual class of unbounded Kasparov\nmodules is not flexible enough to accommodate the unbounded Kasparov product\nand it becomes necessary to twist the commutator condition by an automorphism.\nWe show that the unbounded Kasparov product makes sense in this twisted setting\nand that it recovers the usual interior Kasparov product after taking bounded\ntransforms. Since our unbounded cycles are twisted (or modular) we are not able\nto apply the work of Kucerovsky for recognizing unbounded representatives for\nthe bounded Kasparov product, instead we rely directly on the connection\ncriterion developed by Connes and Skandalis.

More generally, para-$S$-modules provide us\nwith a natural framework to get analogues for paracyclic modules and parachain\ncomplexes of various constructions and equivalence results for cyclic modules\nor mixed complexes. The datum of a para-$S$-module does not provide us with a\nchain complex, and so notions of homology and quasi-isomorphisms do not make\nsense.

By using ideas of Kassel this then allows us to get\ncomparison results between the various para-$S$-modules associated with\npara-precyclic modules, and between them and Connes' cyclic chain complex.\nThese comparison results lead us to alternative descriptions of Connes'\nperiodicity operator.

Furthermore, to each delocalized\ncyclic cocycle, we define a higher analogue of Lott's delocalized eta invariant\nand prove its convergence when the delocalized cyclic cocycle has at most\nexponential growth.\n  Our second main result is to obtain an explicit formula of the delocalized\nConnes-Chern character of all $C^\\ast$-algebraic secondary invariants for word\nhyperbolic groups. Equivalently, we give an explicit formula for the pairing\nbetween $C^\\ast$-algebraic secondary invariants and delocalized cyclic cocycles\nof the group algebra. When the $C^\\ast$-algebraic secondary invariant is a\n$K$-theoretic higher rho invariant of an invertible differential operator, we\nshow this pairing is precisely the higher analogue of Lott's delocalized eta\ninvariant alluded to above. Our work uses Puschnigg's smooth dense subalgebra\nfor word hyperbolic groups in an essential way. We emphasize that our\nconstruction of the delocalized Connes-Chern character is at $C^\\ast$-algebra\n$K$-theory level. This is of essential importance for applications to geometry\nand topology. As a consequence, we compute the paring between delocalized\ncyclic cocycles and $C^\\ast$-algebraic Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index classes for\nmanifolds with boundary, when the fundamental group of the given manifold is\nhyperbolic.\n",

In this article, we discuss several improved and generalised\nvariants of Kucerovsky's theorem. First, we provide a generalisation which\nrelaxes the positivity condition, by replacing the lower bound by a relative\nlower bound. Second, we also discuss Kucerovsky's theorem in the context of\nhalf-closed modules, which generalise unbounded Kasparov modules to symmetric\n(rather than self-adjoint) operators. In order to deal with the positivity\ncondition for such non-self-adjoint operators, we introduce a fairly general\nlocalisation procedure, which (using a suitable approximate unit) provides a\n'localised representative' for the KK-class of a half-closed module. Using this\nlocalisation procedure, we then prove several variants of Kucerovsky's theorem\nfor half-closed modules. A distinct advantage of the localised approach, also\nin the special case of self-adjoint operators (i.e., for unbounded Kasparov\nmodules), is that the (global) positivity condition in Kucerovsky's original\ntheorem is replaced by a (less restrictive) 'local' positivity condition, which\nis closer in spirit to the well-known Connes-Skandalis theorem in the bounded\npicture of KK-theory.\n",

On the resolution the lifted action has fixed isotropy type\ncorresponding to the open stratum and also in an iterated sense, with\nconnecting equivariant fibrations over the boundary hypersurfaces covering the\nresolutions of the other strata. This structure descends to a resolution of the\nquotient as a stratified space. For an Abelian group action the equivariant\nK-theory can then be described in terms of bundles over the bases `dressed' by\nthe representations of the isotropy types with morphisms covering the\nconnecting maps. A similar model is given here covering the non-Abelian case.\nNow the reduced objects are torsion-twisted bundles over finite covers of the\nbases, corresponding to the projective action of the normalizers on the\nrepresentations of the isotropy groups, again with morphisms over all the\nboundaries. This leads to a closely related iterated deRham model for\nequivariant cohomology and, now with values in forms twisted by flat bundles of\nrepresentation rings over the bases, for delocalized equivariant cohomology. We\nshow, as envisioned by Baum, Brylinksi and MacPherson, that the usual\nequivariant Chern character, mapping to equivariant cohomology, factors through\na natural Chern character from equivariant K-theory to delocalized equivariant\ncohomology with the latter giving an Atiyah-Hirzebruch isomorphism.\n",

Using our previous works we define an index morphism\n$$K^0(^bT^*X)\\stackrel{Ind_{ev,cn}^X}{\\longrightarrow}H_{ev}^{cn}(X)$$ for $X$\na manifold with corners of codimension less or equal to three and called here\nthe even conormal index morphism. In the case that $X$ is compact and connected\nand $D$ is an elliptic $b-$pseudodifferential operator in the associated\n$b-$calculus of $X$ we know, by our previous works and other authors works,\nthat, up to adding an identity operator, $D$ can be perturbed (with a\nregularizing operator in the calculus) to a Fredholm operator iff\n$Ind_{ev,cn}^X([\\sigma_D])$ (where $[\\sigma_D]\\in K^0(^bT^*X)$ is the principal\nsymbol class) vanishes in the even conormal homology group $H_{ev}^{cn}(X)$.\nThe main result of this paper is the explicit computation of the even and odd\nconormal index morphisms $Ind_{ev/odd,cn}^X(\\sigma)\\in H_{ev/odd}^{cn}(X)$ for\n$X$ a manifold with corners of codimension less or equal to three. The\ncoefficients of the conormal corner cycles $Ind_{ev/odd,cn}^X(\\sigma)$ are\ngiven in terms of some suspended Atiyah-Singer indices of the maximal\ncodimension faces of $X$ and in terms of some suspended Atiyah-Patodi-Singer\nindices of the non-maximal codimension faces of $X$. As a corollary we give a\ncomplete caracterization to the obstruction of the Fredholm perturbation\nproperty for closed manifolds with corners of codimension less or equal to\nthree in terms of the above mentioned indices of the faces, this allows us as\nwell to give such a characterization in terms of the respective topological\nindices.\n",

The novelty is the use of the local\nanomaly formula established in a previous paper, which represents the bivariant\nChern character of a quasihomomorphism as the chiral anomaly associated to a\nrenormalized non-commutative chiral field theory. In the present situation the\ngeometry is non-metric and the corresponding field theory can be renormalized\nin a purely conformal way, by exploiting the complex-analytic structure of the\ngroupoid only. The index formula is automatically localized at the automorphism\nsubset of the groupoid and involves a cap-product with the sum of two different\ncyclic cocycles over the groupoid algebra. The first cocycle is a trace\ninvolving a generalization of the Lefschetz numbers to higher-order fixed\npoints. The second cocycle is a non-commutative Todd class, constructed from\nthe modular automorphism group of the algebra.\n",

In an extension\nof the concept of Lopatinski and Shapiro, it associates to each operator two\nsymbols: a pseudodifferential principal symbol, which is a bundle homomorphism,\nand an operator-valued boundary symbol. Ellipticity requires the invertibility\nof both. If the underlying manifold is compact, elliptic elements define\nFredholm operators. Boutet de Monvel showed how then the index can be computed\nin topological terms. The crucial observation is that elliptic operators can be\nmapped to compactly supported $K$-theory classes on the cotangent bundle over\nthe interior of the manifold. The Atiyah-Singer topological index map, applied\nto this class, then furnishes the index of the operator. Based on this result,\nFedosov, Rempel-Schulze and Grubb have given index formulas in terms of the\nsymbols. In this paper we survey previous work how C*-algebra K-theory can be\nused to give a proof of Boutet de Monvel's index theorem for boundary value\nproblems, and how the same techniques yield an index theorem for families of\nBoutet de Monvel operators.

In [BKR], we have constructed canonical trace maps Tr_n(A): HC(A)\n-> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL extending the usual characters of representations to higher\ncyclic homology. This raises a question whether a well known theorem of Procesi\n[P] holds in the derived setting: namely, is the algebra homomorphism\nSym[Tr_n(A)]: Sym[HC(A)] -> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL defined by Tr_n(A) surjective ? In\nthe present paper, we answer this question for augmented algebras. Given such\nan algebra, we construct a canonical dense DG subalgebra DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr of\nthe topological DG algebra DRep_\\infty(A)^{GL_\\infty}. It turns out that on\npassing to the inverse limit (as n -> \\infty), the family of maps Sym[Tr_n(A)]\n\"stabilizes\" to an isomorphism Sym[\\bar{HC}(A)] = H[DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr]. The\nderived version of Procesi's theorem does therefore hold in the limit. However,\nfor a fixed (finite) n, there exist homological obstructions to the\nsurjectivity of Sym[Tr_n(A)], and we show on simple examples that these\nobstructions do not vanish in general. We compare our result with the classical\ntheorem of Loday-Quillen and Tsygan on stable homology of matrix Lie algebras.\nWe show that the relative Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C(gl_\\infty(A),\ngl_\\infty(k); k) equipped with the natural coalgebra structure is Koszul dual\nto the DG algebra DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr.

Our first main\nresult is that the square Sq_{B/A}(M) of a DG B-module M is independent of the\nresolutions used to present it. Our second main result is on the trace\nfunctoriality of the squaring operation. We give precise statements and\ncomplete correct proofs.\n  In a subsequent paper we will reproduce the remaining parts of the 2008 paper\nthat require fixing.

In this first article we consider Leavitt\npath algebras of general graphs over general ground rings; the second article\nwill focus mostly on purely infinite simple unital Leavitt path algebras over a\nfield.

To find such a\nrepresentative, we construct dynamical partitions of unity on the Smale space\nwith highly controlled Lipschitz constants. This requires a generalisation of\nBowen's Markov partitions.
