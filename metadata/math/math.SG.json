Our main result is a geometric criterion for the neighborhood\nequivalence between Poisson structures over the same leaf. This criterion gives\na Poisson analog of the relative Darboux theorem due to Weinstein. Within the\ncategory of the algebroids, coupling tensors are introduced on the dual of the\nisotropy of a transitive Lie algebroid over a symplectic base. As a basic\napplication of these results, we show that there is a well defined notion of a\n``linearized'' Poisson structure over a symplectic leaf which gives rise to a\nnatural model for the linearization problem.\n",

Our main\ntool is the equivariant Kirwan map, a natural map from the G-equivariant\ncohomology of M to the G/T-equivariant cohomology of the symplectic reduction\nof M by T. We show this map is surjective. This is an equivariant version of\nthe well-known result that the (nonequivariant) Kirwan map $\\kappa:H_G^*(M)\\to\nH^*(M//G)$ is surjective. We also compute the kernel of the equivariant Kirwan\nmap, generalizing the result due to Tolman and Weitsman in the case T=G and\nallowing us to apply their methods inductively.

Lectures 1 and 2 provide an overview of our\ncurrent knowledge of their algebraic, geometric and homotopy theoretic\nproperties. Lecture 3 sketches the arguments used by Gromov, Abreu and\nAbreu-McDuff to figure out the rational homotopy type of these groups in the\ncases M= CP^2 and M=S^2\\times S^2. We outline the needed J-holomorphic curve\ntechniques. Much of the recent progress in understanding the geometry and\ntopology of these groups has come from studying the properties of fibrations\nwith the manifold M as fiber and structural group equal either to the\nsymplectic group or to its Hamiltonian subgroup Ham(M). The case when the base\nis S^2 has proved particularly important. Lecture 4 describes the geometry of\nHamiltonian fibrations over S^2, while Lecture 5 discusses their Gromov-Witten\ninvariants via the Seidel representation. It ends by sketching Entov's\nexplanation of the ABW inequalities for eigenvalues of products of special\nunitary matrices. Finally in Lecture 6 we apply the ideas developed in the\nprevious two lectures to demonstrate the existence of (short) paths in\nHam(M,\\om) that minimize the Hofer norm over all paths with the given\nendpoints.\n",

Further, if the isotropy has order at most two and the\ncircle contracts in \\Ham(M,\\om) then the homology of M is invariant under an\ninvolution. For example, the image of the normalized moment map is a symmetric\ninterval [-a,a]. If the action is semifree (i.e. the isotropy weights are 0 or\n+/- 1) then we calculate the leading order term in the Seidel representation,\nan important technical tool in understanding the quantum cohomology of\nmanifolds that admit semifree Hamiltonian circle actions. If the manifold is\ntoric, we use our results about this representation to describe the basic\nmultiplicative structure of the quantum cohomology ring of an arbitrary toric\nmanifold.

In this article we introduce a geometric-analytic\nregularization technique which makes such integrals converge and utilizes the\nsymplectic structure of the manifold.

The key step here is to\nredefine the collection of integrals \\int_M alpha(X), X \\in g, as a\ndistribution on the Lie algebra g. We expect our regularization technique to\ngeneralize to non-compact group actions extending the results of [L1,L2].\n",

As a\nconsequence, it is shown that bundles with closed connection form are stable\nunder appropriate small perturbations of the symplectic form. Further, the\nmanifold (M,\\omega) has the property that every symplectic M-bundle has a\nclosed connection form if and only if the flux group vanishes and the flux\nhomomorphism extends to a crossed homomorphism defined on the whole group\nSymp(M). The latter condition is equivalent to saying that a connected\ncomponent of the commutator subgroup [Symp,Symp] intersects the identity\ncomponent of Symp only if it also intersects Ham. It is not yet clear when this\ncondition is satisfied.\n  We show that if the symplectic form vanishes on 2-tori the flux homomorphism\nextends to the subgroup of Symp acting trivially on \\pi_1(M).

We assume that for each embedded Reeb\norbit gamma, the total multiplicity of the negative ends of U_+ at covers of\ngamma agrees with the total multiplicity of the positive ends of U_- at covers\nof gamma. However, unlike in the usual gluing story, here the individual\nmultiplicities are allowed to differ. In this situation, one can often glue U_+\nand U_- to an index 2 curve by inserting genus zero branched covers of\nR-invariant cylinders between them. This paper shows that the signed count of\nsuch gluings equals a signed count of zeroes of a certain section of an\nobstruction bundle over the moduli space of branched covers of the cylinder.\nPart I obtained a combinatorial formula for the latter count and, assuming the\nresult of the present paper, deduced that the differential d in embedded\ncontact homology satisfies d^2=0.

A general\ntheory of the almost Poisson structure is investigated based on a decomposition\nof the bracket into a sum of a Poisson one and an almost Poisson one. The\ncorresponding relation between Poisson structure and symplectic structure is\nproved, making use of Jacobiizer and symplecticizer. Based on analysis of\npseudo-symplectic structure of constraint submanifold of Chaplygin nonholonomic\nsystems, an almost Poisson bracket for the systems is constructed and\ndecomposed into a sum of a canonical Poisson one and an almost Poisson one.\nSimilarly, an almost Poisson structure, which can be decomposed into a sum of\ncanonical one and an almost Lie-Poisson one, is also constructed on an affine\nspace with torsion whose autoparallels are utilized to described the free\nmotion of some non-self-adjoint systems. The decomposition of the almost\nPoisson bracket directly leads to a decomposition of a dynamical vector field\ninto a sum of usual Hamiltionian vector field and an almost Hamiltonian one,\nwhich is useful to simplifying the integration of vector fields.\n",

We compute the Rabinowitz Floer homology of energy\nhypersurfaces $\\Sigma_{k}=H^{-1}(k)$ of mechanical (kinetic energy + potential)\nHamiltonians $H$ for the case when the energy value k is greater than the Mane\ncritical value c.\n  Under the stronger condition that k>c_{0}, where c_{0} denotes the strict\nMane critical value, Abbondandolo and Schwarz recently computed the Rabinowitz\nFloer homology of such hypersurfaces, by means of a short exact sequence of\nchain complexes involving the Rabinowitz Floer chain complex and the Morse\n(co)chain complex associated to the free time action functional. We extend\ntheir results to the weaker case k>c, thus covering cases where $\\sigma$ is not\nexact.\n  As a consequence, we deduce that the hypersurface corresponding to the energy\nlevel k is never displaceable for any k>c. Moreover, we prove that if dim M >\n1, the homology of the free loop space of $M$ is infinite dimensional, and if\nthe metric is chosen generically, a generic Hamiltonian diffeomorphism has\ninfinitely many leaf-wise intersection points in $\\Sigma_{k}$.\n",

(3) Weak fillability is preserved under splicing of contact manifolds\nalong symplectic pre-Lagrangian tori - this gives many new examples of contact\nmanifolds without Giroux torsion that are weakly but not strongly fillable.\n  We establish the obstructions to weak fillings via two parallel approaches\nusing holomorphic curves. In the first approach, we generalize the original\nGromov-Eliashberg \"Bishop disk\" argument to study the special case of Giroux\ntorsion via a Bishop family of holomorphic annuli with boundary on an \"anchored\novertwisted annulus\". The second approach uses punctured holomorphic curves,\nand is based on the observation that every weak filling can be deformed in a\ncollar neighborhood so as to induce a stable Hamiltonian structure on the\nboundary. This also makes it possible to apply the techniques of Symplectic\nField Theory, which we demonstrate in a test case by showing that the\ndistinction between weakly and strongly fillable translates into contact\nhomology as the distinction between twisted and untwisted coefficients.\n",

We prove that when $X$ is complete, when $Y$ is Hamiltonian with\nrespect to another symplectic form $\\omega_2$ defined on $M^0$, and when\nanother technical condition is satisfied, there exists a symplectic\ndiffeomorphism from $(M^0,\\omega_2)$ onto an open subset of $(M,\\omega)$,\nequivariant with respect to the flows of the vector fields $Y$ on $M^0$ and $X$\non $M$. This result explains why the diffeomorphism of the phase space of the\nKepler problem restricted to the negative (resp. positive) values of the energy\nfunction, onto an open subset of the cotangent bundle to a three-dimensional\nsphere (resp. two-sheeted hyperboloid), discovered by Gy\\\"orgyi (1968) [9],\nre-discovered by Ligon and Schaaf (1976) [15], whose properties were discussed\nby Cushman and Duistermaat (1997) [5], is a symplectic diffeomorphism.\nInfinitesimal symmetries of the Ke- pler problem are discussed, and it is shown\nthat their space is a Lie algebroid with zero anchor map rather than a Lie\nalgebra.\n",

We expect to apply outcomes of this article to several\ntypes of Floer homology, thus we define Morse homology purely axiomatically and\nalgebraically. The Morse homology on noncompact manifolds generally depends on\nthe choice of Morse functions; it is easy to see that critical points may\nescape along homotopies of Morse functions on noncompact manifolds. Even worse,\nhomology classes also can escape along homotopies even though critical points\nare alive. The aim of the article is two fold. First, we give an example which\nbreaks the invariance property by the escape of homology classes and find\nappropriate growth conditions on homotopies which prevent such an escape. This\ntakes advantage of the bifurcation method. Another goal is to apply the first\nresults to the invariance problem of Rabinowitz Floer homology. The bifurcation\nmethod for Rabinowitz Floer homology, however, is not worked out yet. Thus\nbelieving that the bifurcation method is applicable to Rabinowitz Floer\nhomology, we study the invariance problems of Rabinowitz Floer homology.\n",

Essentially the same kind of\nconstruction is independently carried out by Usher [Us4] in a slightly less\ngeneral context. Then we explore various applications of these enhancements to\nthe symplectic topology, especially new construction of symplectic\nquasi-states, quasimorphisms and new Lagrangian intersection results on toric\nmanifolds. The most novel part of this paper is to use open-closed\nGromov-Witten theory (operator $\\frak q$ in [FOOO1] and its variant involving\nclosed orbits of periodic Hamiltonian system) to connect spectral invariants\n(with bulk deformation), symplectic quasi-states, quasimorphism to the\nLagrangian Floer theory (with bulk deformation).

Specifically, it seeks to understand when a singular symplectic\nquotient V/G of a symplectic vector space V by a group G \\subseteq Sp_2n(R) is\nrealizable as a Poisson subspace of some Poisson manifold (R^n,{.,.}).\n  The local embedding problem is recast in the language of schemes and\nreinterpreted as a problem of extending the Poisson bracket to infinitesimal\nneighborhoods of an embedded singular space. Such extensions of a Poisson\nbracket near a singular point p of V/G are then related to the cohomology and\nrepresentation theory of the cotangent Lie algebra at p.\n  Using this framework, it is shown that the real 4-dimensional quotient\nV/\\ZZ_n (n odd) is not realizable as a Poisson subspace of any\n(R^{2n+6},{.,.}), even though the underlying variety algebraically embeds into\nR^{2n+6}. The proof of this nonembedding result hinges on a refinement of the\nLevi decomposition for Poisson manifolds to partially linearize any extension\nwith respect to the Levi decomposition of the cotangent Lie algebra of V/G at\nthe origin. Moreover, in the case n=3, this nonembedding result is complemented\nby a concrete realization of V/\\ZZ_3 as a Poisson subspace of R^78.\n",

A topological contact\nisotopy is not generated by a vector field; nevertheless, the group identities,\nthe transformation law, and classical uniqueness results in the smooth case\nextend to topological contact isotopies and homeomorphisms, giving rise to an\nextension of smooth contact dynamics to topological dynamics. Our approach is\nvia symplectization of a contact manifold, and our main tools are an\nenergy-capacity inequality we prove for contact diffeomorphisms, combined with\ntechniques from measure theory on oriented manifolds. We establish\nnon-degeneracy of a Hofer-like bi-invariant pseudo-metric on the group of\nstrictly contact diffeomorphisms constructed in [BD06]. The topological\nautomorphism group of the contact structure exhibits rigidity properties\nanalogous to those of symplectic diffeomorphisms, including C^0-rigidity of\ncontact and strictly contact diffeomorphisms.\n",

In this paper we look at\nembeddings into four-dimensional cubes instead, and determine the function\nc_{EC}(a) whose value at a is the infimum of the size of a 4-cube C^{4}(A) =\nD^{2}(A) times D^{2}(A) into which the ellipsoid E(1,a) symplectically embeds\n(where D^{2}(A) denotes the disc in mathbb{R}^{2} of area A). As in the case of\nembeddings into balls, the structure of the graph of c_{EC}(a) is very rich:\nfor a less than the square sigma^2 of the silver ratio sigma := 1+sqrt(2), the\nfunction c_{EC}(a) turns out to be piecewise linear, with an infinite staircase\nconverging to (sigma^2, sqrt(sigma^2/2)). This staircase is determined by Pell\nnumbers. On the interval [sigma^2,7+1/32], the function c_{EC}(a) coincides\nwith the volume constraint sqrt(a/2) except on seven disjoint intervals, where\nc is piecewise linear. Finally, for a >= 7+1/32, the functions c_{EC}(a) and\nsqrt(a/2) are equal.\n  For the proof, we first translate the embedding problem E(1,a)-->C^{4}(A) to\na certain ball packing problem of the ball B^{4}(2A). This embedding problem is\nthen solved by adapting the method from McDuff-Schlenk, which finds all\nexceptional spheres in blow-ups of the complex projective plane that provide an\nembedding obstruction.\n  We also prove that the ellipsoid E(1,a) symplectically embeds into the cube\nC^{4}(A) if and only if E(1,a) symplectically embeds into the elllipsoid\nE(A,2A). Our embedding function c_{EC}(a) thus also describes the smallest\ndilate of E(1,2) into which E(1,a) symplectically embeds.\n",

Equipping the punctured Riemann surface $(\\dot \\Sigma,j)$\nwith a cylindrical K\\\"ahler metric and isothermal coordinates near every\npuncture, we prove the asymptotic (subsequence) convergence to the `spiraling'\ninstantons along the `rotating' Reeb orbit for any solution $w$, not\nnecessarily for $w^*\\lambda \\circ j$ being exact (i.e., allowing non-zero\n`charge' $Q \\neq 0$), with bounded gradient $\\|d w\\|_{C^0} < C$ and finite\n$\\pi$-harmonic energy. For nondegenerate contact forms, we employ the\n`three-interval method' to prove the exponential convergence to a closed Reeb\norbit when $Q = 0$. (The Morse-Bott case using this method is treated in a\nsequel (arXiv:1311.6196).)\n",

In this paper we give an explicit construction of a\nhomotopy inverse Psi of Phi. Contrary to other previously defined maps going in\nthe same direction, Psi is an isomorphism at the chain level and preserves the\naction filtration. Its definition is based on counting Floer trajectories on\nthe negative half-cylinder which on the boundary satisfy \"half\" of the Hamilton\nequations. Albeit not of Lagrangian type, such a boundary condition defines\nFredholm operators with good compactness properties. We also present a\nheuristic argument which, independently on any Fredholm and compactness\nanalysis, explains why the spaces of maps which are used in the definition of\nPhi and Psi are the natural ones. The Legendre transform plays a crucial role\nboth in our rigorous and in our heuristic arguments. We treat with some detail\nthe delicate issue of orientations and show that the homology of the Floer\ncomplex is isomorphic to the singular homology of the loop space of M with a\nsystem of local coefficients, which is defined by the pull-back of the second\nStiefel-Whitney class of TM on 2-tori in M.\n",

In particular, the wrapped\ncategory is compactly generated and cohomologically finite. The proof uses a\ndeformation argument, via a generic generation theorem and an argument about\ncontinuity of eigenspaces.

Since the structure of a metaplectic-c\nprequantization is more complicated than that of a circle bundle, we find that\nthe definition must include an extra condition that does not have an analogue\nin the Kostant-Souriau case.

In the present article, we\nprove that the equivalence class of this cellular DGA does not depend on the\nchoice of decomposition, and in the sequel [35] we use this result to show that\nthe cellular DGA is equivalent to the usual Legendrian contact homology DGA\ndefined via holomorphic curves.\n  Extensions are made to allow Legendrians with non-generic cone-point\nsingularities. We apply our approach to compute the LCH DGA for several\nexamples including an infinite family, and to give general formulas for DGAs of\nfront spinnings allowing for the axis of symmetry to intersect $L$.\n",

We describe, in full detail,\nthe rational homotopy Lie algebra of this group.\n  We show that some particular circle actions contained in the\nsymplectomorphism group generate its full topology. More precisely, they give\nthe generators of the homotopy graded Lie algebra of $\\rm{Symp} (S^2 \\times S^2\n\\#\\, 3\\overline{ \\mathbb C\\mathbb P}\\,\\!^2, \\omega)$. Our study depends on\nKarshon's classification of Hamiltonian circle actions and the inflation\ntechnique introduced by Lalonde-McDuff. As an application, we deduce the rank\nof the homotopy groups of $\\rm{Symp}({\\mathbb C\\mathbb P}^2 \\#\\,\n5\\overline{\\mathbb C\\mathbb P}\\,\\!^2, \\tilde \\omega)$, in the case of small\nblow-ups.\n",

We show that the positive lower and finite upper bounds\nfor the area of such a disk (which are due to M. Gromov and J.-C. Sikorav and\nF.

The main\napplication is to a $C^0$-characterization of contact embeddings in terms of\ncoisotropic embeddings in another paper by the present author. Moreover, we\nprove a version of Gromov's non-existence of exact Lagrangian embeddings into\nstandard $\\mathbb{R}^{2 n}$ for coisotropic embeddings into $S^1 \\times\n\\mathbb{R}^{2 n}$. This allows us to distinguish different contact structures\non the latter by means of the (modified) contact shape invariant.

In contrast to the local bifurcations of\ndynamical systems that are often related to a change in the number or stability\nof equilibria, bifurcations of boundary value problems are global in nature and\nmay not be related to any obvious change in dynamical behaviour. Catastrophe\ntheory is a well-developed framework which studies the bifurcations of critical\npoints of functions. In this paper we study the bifurcations of solutions of\nboundary-value problems for symplectic maps, using the language of\n(finite-dimensional) singularity theory. We associate certain such problems\nwith a geometric picture involving the intersection of Lagrangian submanifolds,\nand hence with the critical points of a suitable generating function. Within\nthis framework, we then study the effect of three special cases: (i) some\ncommon boundary conditions, such as Dirichlet boundary conditions for\nsecond-order systems, restrict the possible types of bifurcations (for example,\nin generic planar systems only the A-series beginning with folds and cusps can\noccur); (ii) integrable systems, such as planar Hamiltonian systems, can\nexhibit a novel periodic pitchfork bifurcation; and (iii) systems with\nHamiltonian symmetries or reversing symmetries can exhibit restricted\nbifurcations associated with the symmetry. This approach offers an alternative\nto the analysis of critical points in function spaces, typically used in the\nstudy of bifurcation of variational problems, and opens the way to the\ndetection of more exotic bifurcations than the simple folds and cusps that are\noften found in examples.\n",

The main topic of\nthis note is a detailed introduction of Tamarkin category theory from a\nquantitative perspective, followed by a demonstration of various applications\nin symplectic topology. Many examples are provided in order to obtain certain\ngeometric intuitions of those abstract algebraic constructions in Tamarkin\ncategory. In this note, we try to explain how standard symplectic techniques,\nfor instance, generating function, capacities, symplectic homology, etc., are\nelegantly packaged in the language of sheaves as well as related intriguing\nsheaf operators. In addition, many concepts developed in Tamarkin category\ntheory are natural generalizations of persistent homology theory, so their\nrelations are emphasized along with the development of the note.\n",

More recently, Usher's work shows that the appearance of\ninfinite staircases as $b$ varies is hard to predict. The intricate structure\nfound there suggests that determining the entirety of the graph of $c_b(a)$ for\nall $b$ is intractable.\n  In contrast with this result, we show that for every polydisc $P(1,b)$ with\n$b>2$, there is an explicit formula for the minimum $a$ such that the embedding\nproblem is determined only by volume. That is, when the ellipsoid is\nsufficiently stretched, there is a symplectic embedding of $E(1,a)$ fully\nfilling an appropriately scaled polydisc $P(\\lambda,\\lambda b)$. We call this\nvalue of $a$ the rigid-flexible value at $b$, or the RF-value. This formula is\npiecewise smooth in $b$.\n  To further describe the function $RF(b)$, we investigate its behavior as\n$b\\to 1$. Frenkel and M\\\"{u}ller showed that the $RF$-value at $b=1$ is $7\n\\frac{1}{32}$ and Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk showed that the\n$RF$-value at $b=2$ is $8 \\frac{1}{36}.$ By exhibiting a sequence of\nobstructive classes for $b = \\frac{n+1}{n}$ at $a=8$, in combination with the\nFrenkel-M\\\"{u}ller result, we show that $RF$ is discontinuous at $b=1$.\n",

In particular, this yields a\nclassification of compact symplectic surfaces in terms of De Rham cohomology.\nIn this paper we generalize these results for volume forms admitting\ntransversal zeroes. In this case there is also a cohomology capturing the\nclassification: the relative cohomology with respect to the set of critical\nhypersurface. We compare this classification scheme with the classification of\nPoisson structures on surfaces which are symplectic away from a hypersurface\nwhere they fulfill a transversality assumption ($b$-Poisson structures). We do\nthis using the desingularization technique introduced by\nGuillemin-Miranda-Weitsman and extend it to $b^m$-Nambu structures.\n",

Our construction uses Morse-Bott theory and is related to the\npositive S^1-equivariant symplectic homology of Bourgeois-Oancea. However,\ninstead of working with Hamiltonian Floer homology, we work directly in contact\ngeometry, using families of almost complex structures. When cylindrical contact\nhomology can also be defined, it agrees with the tensor product of the\nS^1-equivariant contact homology with Q. We also present examples showing that\nthe S^1-equivariant contact homology contains interesting torsion information.\n  In a subsequent paper we will use obstruction bundle gluing to extend the\nabove story to closed three-manifolds with dynamically convex contact forms,\nwhich in particular will prove that their cylindrical contact homology has a\nlift to integer coefficients which depends only on the contact structure.\n",

We show that if the category contains a certain\none-parameter family of objects, then every countably Borel-generating set of\n(normalized) capacities has cardinality (strictly) bigger than the continuum.\nThis appears to be the first result regarding the problem of CHLS, except for\ntwo results of D. McDuff about the category of ellipsoids in dimension 4.\n  We also prove that every finitely differentiably generating set of capacities\non a given symplectic category is uncountable, provided that the category\ncontains a one-parameter family of symplectic manifolds that is ``strictly\nvolume-increasing'' and ``embedding-capacity-wise constant''. It follows that\nthe Ekeland-Hofer capacities and the volume capacity do not finitely\ndifferentiably generate all generalized capacities on the category of\nellipsoids. This answers a variant of a question of CHLS.\n  In addition, we prove that if a given symplectic category contains a certain\none-parameter family of objects, then almost no normalized capacity is domain-\nor target-representable.

We provide a general framework for\nanalyzing this question for a large family of targets, called finite type\nconvex toric domains, which we prove generalizes the class of closed toric\nsymplectic 4-manifolds. When the target is of finite type, we prove that any\ninfinite staircase must have a unique accumulation point a_0, given as the\nsolution to an explicit quadratic equation. Moreover, we prove that the\nembedding function at a_0 must be equal to the classical volume lower bound. In\nparticular, our result gives an obstruction to the existence of infinite\nstaircases that we show is powerful.\n  In the special case of rational convex toric domains, we can say more. We\nconjecture a complete answer to the question of existence of infinite\nstaircases, in terms of six families that are distinguished by the fact that\ntheir moment polygon is reflexive. We then provide a uniform proof of the\nexistence of infinite staircases for our six families, using two tools. For the\nfirst, we use recursive families of almost toric fibrations to find symplectic\nembeddings. For the second tool, we find recursive families of convex lattice\npaths that provide obstructions to embeddings. We conclude by reducing our\nconjecture that these are the only infinite staircases among rational convex\ntoric domains to a question in number theory related to a classic work of Hardy\nand Littlewood.\n",

In this work, we do something\nsimilar, yet the distance we define is less restrictive.

This function was known to have an infinite staircase in the monotone\ncases ($b= 0$ and $ b= 1/3$). It is also known that for each $b$ there is at\nmost one value of $z$ that can be the accumulation point of such a staircase.\nIn this manuscript, we identify three sequences of open, disjoint, blocked\n$b$-intervals, consisting of $b$-parameters where the embedding capacity\nfunction for $H_b$ does not contain an infinite staircase. There is one\nsequence in each of the intervals $(0,1/5)$, $(1/5,1/3)$, and $(1/3,1)$.

These Poisson\nsubmersions have coregular Poisson-Dirac fibres, and behave functorially with\nrespect to such submanifolds. We discuss the subtle collective behavior of the\nPoisson fibers of such Poisson fibrations, and explain their relation to\npencils of Poisson structures.\n  The third and final part applies the theory developed to Poisson submersions\nwith Poisson fibres which arise in Lie theory.

Guillemin and Sternberg\nconsider the former, studing half-densities and phase functions on its\nso-called character Lagrangians $\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{O}}\\subseteq T^*G$. Our\nquasi-Hamiltonian counterpart replaces these character Lagrangians with the\nuniversal centralizers $\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{C}}\\longrightarrow\\mathcal{C}$ of\nregular, $\\frac{1}{k}$-integral conjugacy classes $\\mathcal{C}\\subseteq G$. We\nshow each universal centralizer to be a \"quasi-Hamiltonian Lagrangian\" in\n$D(G)$, and to come equipped with a half-density and phase function.\n  At the same time, we consider a Dehn twist-induced automorphism\n$R:D(G)\\longrightarrow D(G)$ that lacks a natural Hamiltonian analogue. Each\nquasi-Hamiltonian Lagrangian $R(\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{C}})$ is shown to have a\nclean intersection with every $\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{C}'}$, and to come equipped\nwith a half-density and phase function of its own.

Our proof uses the delinearization theorem of Alekseev which relates a\nclassical Hamiltonian action of $K$ with $\\mathfrak{k}^*$-valued moment map to\na Hamiltonian action with an $AN$-valued moment map, via a deformation of\nsymplectic structures. We obtain our main result by proving a ``delinearization\ncommutes with symplectic quotients'' theorem which is also of independent\ninterest, and then putting this together with the local normal form theorem for\nclassical Hamiltonian actions wtih $\\mathfrak{k}^*$-valued moment maps. A key\ningredient for our main result is the delinearization\n$\\mathcal{D}(\\omega_{can})$ of the canonical symplectic structure on $T^*K$, so\nwe additionally take some steps toward explicit computations of\n$\\mathcal{D}(\\omega_{can})$. In particular, in the case $K=SU(2)$, we obtain\nexplicit formulas for the matrix coefficients of $\\mathcal{D}(\\omega_{can})$\nwith respect to a natural choice of coordinates on $T^*SU(2)$.\n",

We formulate the construction in the\nfollowing general context: we associate to each compact subset of a closed\nsymplectic manifold a new chain-level model for symplectic cohomology with\nsupport, which we show carries an action of a model for the chains on the\nmoduli space of framed genus $0$ curves. This construction turns out to be\nstrictly functorial with respect to inclusions of subsets, and the action of\nthe symplectomorphism group. In the general context, we appeal to virtual\nfundamental chain methods to construct the operations over fields of\ncharacteristic $0$, and we give a separate account, over arbitrary rings, in\nthe special settings where Floer's classical transversality approach can be\napplied. We perform all constructions over the Novikov ring, so that the\nalgebraic structures we produce are compatible with the quantitative\ninformation that is contained in Floer theory. Over fields of characteristic\n$0$, our construction can be combined with results in the theory of operads to\nproduce explicit operations encoding the structure of a homotopy $BV$ algebra.\nIn an appendix, we explain how to extend the results of the paper from the\nclass of closed symplectic manifolds to geometrically bounded ones.\n",

The delayed Rabinowitz action\nfunctional is invariant under individual time translation for each particle.\nAlthough its critical point equation looks like a Hamiltonian delay equation it\nis actually an ODE in disguise and nothing else than the critical point\nequation of the undelayed Rabinowitz action functional. We show that we can\neven interpolate between the two action functionals without changing the\ncritical points and their actions. Moreover, for each of these interpolating\naction functionals we have compactness for gradient flow lines under a suitable\nrestricted contact type assumption.\n",

Specifically, we study one-parameter\nfamilies $(M^4,\\omega,F_t=(J,H_t))_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1}$ of systems with a fixed\nHamiltonian $S^1$-space $(M,\\omega,J)$ and which are semitoric for certain\nvalues of the parameter $t$, with a focus on such families in which one\nsingular point undergoes a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation (also called nodal\ntrade in the context of semitoric systems, and more generally almost toric\nfibrations). Beyond semitoric systems, we also study families containing\nhypersemitoric systems, and we investigate the local theory of a nodal\ntrade.\\\\Building on and generalizing the ideas of a previous paper, we show how\nsuch families can be used to find explicit semitoric systems with certain\ndesired invariants (bundled in the marked semitoric polygon). This allows us to\nmake progress on the semitoric minimal model program by understanding and\ncoming up with explicit systems for each strictly minimal type (i.e., those not\nadmitting any toric or semitoric type blowdown). In order to obtain these\nsystems, we develop strategies for constructing and understanding explicit\nexamples of semitoric (and hypersemitoric) systems in general. One strategy we\nmake use of is to start from a well-understood system (such as a toric system)\nand to explicitly induce Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations to produce focus-focus\nsingular points. This is an expanded version of the technique used in the\naforementioned previous paper, in order to apply it to semitoric systems which\ninclude non-trivial isotropy spheres in the underlying $S^1$-space (i.e.,\n$\\mathbb{Z}_k$-spheres), which occurs in several of the strictly minimal\nsystems.\\\\In particular, we give an explicit one-parameter family of systems on\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ which transitions between being of toric type, semitoric type,\nand hypersemitoric type depending on the value of the parameter. We study this\nsystem at each stage, computing the marked semitoric polygon of the semitoric\nsystem and determining several properties of the hypersemitoric system,\nincluding the existence of a unique flap and two parabolic orbits. Furthermore,\nwe study the transitions between these stages.\\\\We also come up with new\nexplicit semitoric systems on all Hirzebruch surfaces which, together with the\nprevious systems and the systems already contained in the literature, gives an\nexplicit model for every type of strictly minimal system. Moreover, we show how\nto obtain every strictly minimal system by applying sequences of alternating\ntoric type blowups and blowdowns to simple explicit systems. In particular, we\nobtain that every strictly minimal semitoric polygon can be obtained from a\nsemitoric system which is part of a family $(M,\\omega,F_t=(J,H_t))$ which is\nsemitoric for all but a finite number of values of $t$, called a semitoric\nfamily.\n",

Siefring introduced a homotopy-invariant generalized intersection\nnumber and singularity index for punctured pseudoholomorphic curves, by adding\ncontributions from curve's asymptotic behavior to the standard intersection\nnumber and singularity index. In this article, we provide a stratification of\nthe moduli space that describes the rate of asymptotic convergence of the\npseudoholomorphic curves. Using this stratification, we provide a more\nintricate characterization of the curves for which these added contribution to\nthe intersection number and singularity index vanishes. In doing so, we prove\nthat the asymptotic contribution to intersection number and singularity index\nvanishes under generic perturbations.

Our first result gives an explicit description of\nthe leaves of $L \\star R$ in terms of those of $L$ and $R$, surprisingly ruling\nout the pathologies which plague general ``induced Dirac structures''.\n  In contrast to the tangent product, the more novel contangent product $L\n\\circledast R$ need not be Dirac even if smooth. When it is, we say that $L$\nand $R$ \\emph{concur}.\n  Concurrence captures commuting Poison structures, refines the \\emph{Dirac\npairs} of Dorfman and Kosmann-Schwarzbach, and it is our proposal as the\nnatural notion of ``compatibility'' between Dirac structures.\n  The rest of the paper is devoted to illustrating the usefulness of tangent-\nand cotangent products in general, and the notion of concurrence in particular.\nDirac products clarify old constructions in Poisson geometry, characterize\nDirac structures which can be pushed forward by a smooth map, and mandate a\nversion of a local normal form. Magri and Morosi's $P\\Omega$-condition and\nVaisman's notion of two-forms complementary to a Poisson structures are found\nto be instances of concurrence, as is the setting for the Frobenius-Nirenberg\ntheorem. We conclude the paper with an interpretation in the style of Magri and\nMorosi of generalized complex structures which concur with their conjugates.\n",

For\nexample, we may compute a global integral by summing integrals at each of the\nfixed points. Or, if we know that the global integral is zero, we conclude that\nthe sum of the local integrals is zero. This often turns topological questions\ninto combinatorial ones and vice versa. This expository article features\nseveral instances of localization that occur at the crossroads of symplectic\nand algebraic geometry on the one hand, and combinatorics and representation\ntheory on the other. The examples come largely from the symplectic category,\nwith particular attention to toric varieties. In the spirit of the 2006\nInternational Conference on Toric Topology at Osaka City University, the main\ngoal of this exposition is to exhibit toric techniques that arise in symplectic\ngeometry.\n",

When they exist,\ncanonical classes form a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of M; in\nparticular, when M is a flag variety, these classes are the equivariant\nSchubert classes. We show that the restriction of a canonical class \\alpha_p to\na fixed point q can be calculated by a rational function which depends only on\nthe value of the moment map, and the restriction of other canonical classes to\npoints of index exactly two higher. Therefore, the structure constants can be\ncalculated by a similar rational function. Our restriction formula is\nmanifestly positive in many cases, including when M is a flag manifold.\nFinally, we prove the existence of integral canonical classes in the case that\nM is a GKM manifold the moment map component is index increasing. In this case,\nour restriction formula specializes to an easily computable rational sum which\ndepends only on the GKM graph.\n",

The moment map induces an\nembedding of the quotient of the manifold by the torus action into the dual of\nthe Lie algebra of the torus; its image is a unimodular (\"Delzant\") polytope;\nthis gives a bijection between unimodular polytopes and isomorphism classes of\ncompact connected symplectic toric manifolds. In this paper we extend Delzant's\nclassification to non-compact symplectic toric manifolds. For a non-compact\nsymplectic toric manifold the image of the moment map need not be convex and\nthe induced map on the quotient need not be an embedding. Moreover, even when\nthe map on the quotient is an embedding, its image no longer determines the\nsymplectic toric manifold; a degree two characteristic class on the quotient\nmakes an appearance. Nevertheless, the quotient is a manifold with corners, and\nthe induced map from the quotient to the dual of the Lie algebra is what we\ncall a unimodular local embedding. We classify non-compact symplectic toric\nmanifolds in terms of manifolds with corners equipped with degree two\ncohomology classes and unimodular local embeddings into the dual of the Lie\nalgebra of the corresponding torus. The main new ingredient is the construction\nof a symplectic toric manifold from such data. The proof passes through an\nequivalence of categories between symplectic toric manifolds and symplectic\ntoric bundles over a fixed unimodular local embedding. This equivalence also\ngives a geometric interpretation of the degree two cohomology class.\n",

(Here $a \\ge 1$ is the ratio of the area of the large axis to that of\nthe smaller axis.) The structure of the graph of $c(a)$ is surprisingly rich.\nThe volume constraint implies that $c(a)$ is always greater than or equal to\nthe square root of $a$, and it is not hard to see that this is equality for\nlarge $a$. However, for $a$ less than the fourth power $\\tau^4$ of the golden\nratio, $c(a)$ is piecewise linear, with graph that alternately lies on a line\nthrough the origin and is horizontal. We prove this by showing that there are\nexceptional curves in blow ups of the complex projective plane whose homology\nclasses are given by the continued fraction expansions of ratios of Fibonacci\nnumbers. On the interval $[\\tau^4,7]$ we find $c(a)=(a+1)/3$. For $a \\ge 7$,\nthe function $c(a)$ coincides with the square root except on a finite number of\nintervals where it is again piecewise linear.\n  The embedding constraints coming from embedded contact homology give rise to\nanother capacity function $c_{ECH}$ which may be computed by counting lattice\npoints in appropriate right angled triangles. According to Hutchings and\nTaubes, the functorial properties of embedded contact homology imply that\n$c_{ECH}(a) \\le c(a)$ for all $a$. We show here that $c_{ECH}(a) \\ge c(a)$ for\nall $a$.\n",

More explicitly, given a generic component of the moment map, they\ndefine a canonical class $\\alpha_p$ in the equivariant cohomology of the\nmanifold $M$ for each fixed point $p \\in M$. When they exist, canonical classes\nform a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of $M$. In particular, when\n$M$ is a flag variety, these classes are the equivariant Schubert classes. It\nis a long standing problem in combinatorics to find positive integral formulas\nfor the equivariant structure constants associated to this basis. Since\ncomputing the restriction of the canonical classes to the fixed points\ndetermines these structure constants, it is important to find effective\nformulas for these restrictions. In this paper, we introduce new techniques for\ncalculating the restrictions of a canonical class $\\alpha_p$ to a fixed point\n$q$. Our formulas are nearly always simpler, in the sense that they count the\ncontributions over fewer paths.

An interesting feature of this\n\"structure sheaf\" is that the symplectic form itself is part of its curvature\nterm. Using this interpretation homological mirror symmetry can be understood\nby well-known duality theories in mathematics: Koszul duality or Fourier- Mukai\ntransform. In this paper we perform the above constructions over a small open\nsubset inside the smooth locus of a Lagrangian torus fibration. In a subsequent\nwork we shall use the language of derived geometry to obtain a global theory\nover the whole smooth locus. However we do not know how to extend this\nconstruction to the singular locus. As an application of the local theory we\nprove a version of homological mirror symmetry between a toric symplectic\nmanifold and its Landau-Ginzburg mirror.\n",

Moreover, McDuff also showed a product of two\nprojective spaces $\\bC P^r\\times \\bC P^s$ with any given symplectic form has a\nunique toric structure provided that $r,s\\geq 2$. In contrast, the product $\\bC\nP^r \\times \\bC P^1$ can be given infinitely many distinct toric structures,\nthough only a finite number of these are compatible with each given symplectic\nform $\\omega$. In this paper we extend these results by considering the\npossible toric structures on a toric symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$ with\n$\\dim H^2(M)=2$. In particular, all such manifolds are $\\bC P^r$ bundles over\n$\\bC P^s$ for some $r,s$. We show that there is a unique toric structure if\n$r<s$, and also that if $r,s\\geq 2$ then $M$ has at most finitely many distinct\ntoric structures that are compatible with any symplectic structure on $M$.\nThus, in this case the finiteness result does not depend on fixing the\nsymplectic structure.

This functor derives homological mirror symmetry under some\nexplicit assumptions.\n  As an application, the construction is applied to spheres with three orbifold\npoints to produce their quantum-corrected mirrors and derive homological mirror\nsymmetry.

The SFT type idea behind the Li-Ruan approach has the\npotential of avoiding many issues with the degeneration of the metric on the\ntarget occurring in the IP approach. Unfortunately, the LR paper is vague about\nthe key notions and aspects of the setup, including the definition of relative\nstable maps, and does not contain even a description of the local structure of\nthe relative moduli space or an attempt at a complete proof of any major\nstatement. The only technical arguments in this paper concern fairly minor\npoints and are either incorrect or unnecessary. Neither of the two papers even\nconsiders gluing stable maps with extra rubber structure, which is necessary\nfor defining the relevant invariants outside of a relatively narrow collection\nof \"semi-positive\" cases. In this manuscript, we re-formulate the (numerical)\nsymplectic sum formula, describe the issues arising in both approaches, and\nexplain how the Li-Ruan SFT type idea can be used to address them.\n",

We propose a new definition of\nKuranishi space, which has the nice property that they form a 2-category $\\bf\nKur$. Thus the homotopy category Ho$({\\bf Kur})$ is an ordinary category of\nKuranishi spaces.\n  Any Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono (FOOO) Kuranishi space $\\bf X$ can be made into a\ncompact Kuranishi space $\\bf X'$ uniquely up to equivalence in $\\bf Kur$ (that\nis, up to isomorphism in Ho$({\\bf Kur})$), and conversely any compact Kuranishi\nspace $\\bf X'$ comes from some (nonunique) FOOO Kuranishi space $\\bf X$. So\nFOOO Kuranishi spaces are equivalent to ours at one level, but our definition\nhas better categorical properties. The same holds for McDuff and Wehrheim's\n'Kuranishi atlases' in arXiv:1508.01556.\n  Using results of Yang on polyfolds and Kuranishi spaces surveyed in\narXiv:1510.06849, a compact topological space $X$ with a 'polyfold Fredholm\nstructure' in the sense of Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder (see e.g.\narXiv:1407.3185) can be made into a Kuranishi space $\\bf X$ uniquely up to\nequivalence in $\\bf Kur$.\n  Our Kuranishi spaces are based on the author's theory of Derived Differential\nGeometry (see e.g. arXiv:1206.4207), the study of classes of derived manifolds\nand orbifolds that we call 'd-manifolds' and 'd-orbifolds'. There is an\nequivalence of 2-categories ${\\bf Kur}\\simeq{\\bf dOrb}$, where $\\bf dOrb$ is\nthe 2-category of d-orbifolds. So Kuranishi spaces are really a form of derived\norbifold.

Every such moduli space is characterized by a second\nhomology class, genus, and contact data. For certain almost complex structures,\nwe show that the moduli space of stable log J-holomorphic curves of any fixed\ntype is compact and metrizable with respect to an enhancement of the Gromov\ntopology. In the case of smooth symplectic divisors, our compactification is\noften smaller than the relative compactification and there is a projection map\nfrom the latter onto the former. The latter is constructed via expanded\ndegenerations of the target. Our construction does not need any modification of\n(or any extra structure on) the target. Unlike the classical moduli spaces of\nstable maps, these log moduli spaces are often virtually singular. We describe\nan explicit toric model for the normal cone (i.e. the space of gluing\nparameters) to each stratum in terms of the defining combinatorial data of that\nstratum. In [FT2], we introduce a natural set up for studying the deformation\ntheory of log (and relative) curves and obtain a logarithmic analog of the\nspace of Ruan-Tian perturbations for these moduli spaces. In a forthcoming\npaper, we will prove a gluing theorem for smoothing log curves in the normal\ndirection to each stratum.

The process\nof lifting such structures to their Lie algebroid version makes them less\nsingular, as their singular behavior is incorporated in the anchor of the Lie\nalgebroid. We develop a framework for this using the concept of a divisor,\nwhich encodes the singularities, and show when structures exhibiting such\nsingularities can be lifted to a Lie algebroid built out of the divisor. Once\none has successfully lifted the structure, it becomes possible to study it\nusing more powerful techniques. In the case of Poisson structures one can turn\nto employing symplectic techniques. These lead for example to normal form\nresults for the underlying Poisson structures around their singular loci. In\nthis thesis we further adapt the methods of Gompf and Thurston for constructing\nsymplectic structures out of fibration-like maps to their Lie algebroid\ncounterparts. More precisely, we introduce the notion of a Lie algebroid\nLefschetz fibration and show when these give rise to A-symplectic structures\nfor a given Lie algebroid A.

The present work was\nmotivated by the effort to explain the coisotropic structure of the constraint\nsubset for the initial value problem by extending the notion of hamiltonian\nstructure from Lie algebra actions to general Lie algebroids over presymplectic\nmanifolds. After comparing possible compatibility conditions between the anchor\n$A\\to TM$ and the presymplectic structure on the base $M$, we choose the most\nnatural of them, given by a suitably chosen connection on $A$. We define a\nnotion of momentum section of $A^*$ and a condition for compatibility with the\nLie bracket. A Lie algebroid over a presymplectic manifold with compatible\nanchor and momentum section is then called hamiltonian. For an action Lie\nalgebroid, we retrieve the conditions of a hamiltonian action. The clean zero\nlocus of the momentum section of a hamiltonian Lie algebroid is a coisotropic\nsubmanifold. We show that a bracket-compatible momentum map is equivalent to a\nclosed basic extension of the presymplectic form, within the generalization of\nthe BRST model of equivariant cohomology to Lie algebroids. We construct\ngroupoids by reduction of an action Lie groupoid $G\\times M$ by a subgroup $H$\nof $G$ which is not necessarily normal, and we find conditions which imply that\na hamiltonian structure descends to their Lie algebroids. We consider many\nexamples and, in particular, find that the tangent Lie algebroid over a\nsymplectic manifold is hamiltonian with respect to some connection if and only\nif the symplectic structure has a nowhere vanishing primitive. Recent results\nof Stratmann and Tang show that this is the case whenever the symplectic\nstructure is exact.\n",

Motivated by the study of Nishinou-Nohara-Ueda on the\nFloer theory of Gelfand-Cetlin systems, we provide a detailed description of\ntopology of Gelfand-Cetlin fibers. In particular, we prove that any fiber over\nan interior point of a k-dimensional face of the Gelfand-Cetlin polytope is an\nisotropic submanifold and is diffeomorphic to $(S^1)^k \\times N$ for some\nsmooth manifold $N$. We also prove that such $N$'s are exactly the vanishing\ncycles shrinking to points in the associated toric variety via the toric\ndegeneration. We also devise an algorithm of reading off Lagrangian fibers from\nthe combinatorics of the ladder diagram.\n",

In fact, we prove the a priori stronger statement that this group\nis not perfect.\n  An important step in our proof involves verifying for certain smooth twist\nmaps a conjecture of Hutchings concerning recovering the Calabi invariant from\nthe asymptotics of spectral invariants defined using periodic Floer homology.\nAnother key step, which builds on recent advances in continuous symplectic\ntopology, involves proving that these spectral invariants extend continuously\nto area-preserving homeomorphisms of the disc. These two properties of PFH\nspectral invariants are potentially of independent interest.\n  Our general strategy is partially inspired by suggestions of Fathi and the\napproach of Oh towards the simplicity question. In particular, we show that\ninfinite twist maps, studied by Oh, are not finite energy homeomorphisms, which\nresolves the \"infinite twist conjecture\" in the affirmative; these twist maps\nare now the first examples of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms which can be said to\nhave infinite energy. Another consequence of our work is that various forms of\nfragmentation for volume preserving homeomorphisms which hold for higher\ndimensional balls fail in dimension two.\n",

However the\nMironov construction of lagrangian cycles itself can be directly extended to\nmuch wider class of compact algrebraic varieties: namely it works in the case\nwhen algebraic variety $X$ of complex dimension $n$ admits $T^k$ - action and\nan anti - holomorphic involution such that the real part $X_{\\mathbb{R}}\n\\subset X$ has real dimension $n$ and is transversal to the torus action. For\nthis case one has families of lagrangian submanifolds and cycles.\n  In the present small text we show how the construction of Mironov cycles\nworks for the complex Grassmannians, resulting in simple examples of smooth\nlagrangian submanifolds in ${\\rm Gr}(k, n+1)$, equipped with a standard Kahler\nform under the Pl\\\"{u}cker embedding.

The existence of a homotopy comomentum map about the\nlatter depends on the dimension of the sphere and the transitivity of the group\naction. Several concrete examples of such actions are also provided.\n  The second novel result is the explicit construction of the higher analogue\nof the embedding of the Poisson algebra of a given symplectic manifold into the\ncorresponding twisted Lie algebroid. It is also proved a compatibility\ncondition for such embedding for gauge-related multisymplectic manifolds in\npresence of a compatible Hamiltonian group action. The latter construction\ncould play a role in determining the multisymplectic analogue of the geometric\nquantization procedure.\n  Finally, a concrete construction of a homotopy comomentum map for the action\nof the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms on the multisymplectic\n3-dimensional Euclidean space is proposed. This map can be naturally related to\nhydrodynamics. For instance, it transgresses to the standard hydrodynamical\nco-momentum map of Arnold, Marsden and Weinstein and others.

Connections between pairs of critical points are realized as genuine\nintersections between unstable and stable manifolds, which (despite being\ninfinite dimensional objects) turn out to have finite dimensional intersection\nwith good compactness properties. This follows from the existence of an\nadditional structure, namely a strongly integrable (0)-essential subbundle,\nwhich behaves nicely under the negative gradient flow of the Hamiltonian action\nand which is needed to make comparisons. Transversality is achieved by\ngenerically perturbing the negative gradient vector field $-\\nabla \\mathbb A_H$\nof the Hamiltonian action within a class of pseudo-gradient vector fields\npreserving all good compactness properties of $-\\nabla \\mathbb A_H$. This\nfollows from an abstract transversality result of independent interest for\nvector fields on a Hilbert manifold for which stable and unstable manifolds of\nrest points are infinite dimensional. The resulting Morse homology is\nindependent of the choice of the Hamiltonian (and of all other choices but the\nchoice of the (0)-essential subbundle, which however only changes the\nMorse-complex by a shift of the indices) and is isomorphic to the Floer\nhomology of $T^*M$ as well as to the singular homology of the free loop space\nof $M$.\n",

In most cases there are just finitely many\nobstructions to such an embedding besides the volume. If there are infinitely\nmany obstructions, $X$ is said to have a staircase. This paper gives an almost\ncomplete description of the staircases in the ellipsoidal capacity functions of\nthe symplectic Hirzebruch surfaces $H_b$ formed by blowing up the projective\nplane with weight $b$. We describe an interweaving, recursively defined, family\nof obstructions to symplectic embeddings of ellipsoids that show there is an\nopen dense set of shape parameters $b$ that are blocked, i.e. have no\nstaircase, and an uncountable number of other values of $b$ that do admit\nstaircases. The remaining $b$-values form a countable sequence of special\nrational numbers that are closely related to the symmetries discussed in\nMagill--McDuff (arXiv:2106.09143). We show that none of them admit ascending\nstaircases. Conjecturally, none admit descending staircases. Finally, we show\nthat, as long as $b$ is not one of these special rational values, any staircase\nin $H_b$ has irrational accumulation point. A crucial ingredient of our proofs\nis the new, more indirect approach to using almost toric fibrations in the\nanalysis of staircases by Magill (arXiv:2204.12460). In particular, the\nstructure of the relevant mutations of the set of almost toric fibrations on\n$H_b$ is echoed in the structure of the set of blocked $b$-intervals.\n",

More\nprecisely, we prove a conjecture of Futaki and Ueda in arXiv:1004.0078 which\nposits that the equivariance in the A-model can be incorporated by pulling back\nthe superpotential to the total space of the corresponding crepant resolution.\nOur approach is predicated on the fact that the Morsifications used in\narXiv:1903.01351 are equivariant with respect to the group actions appearing on\nthe A-side of the conjecture. Along the way, we show that the category of\nmatrix factorisations of the mirror has a tilting object whose length is the\ndimension of the state space of the FJRW A--model, which might also be of\nindependent interest.\n",

Next, the behaviour of\nthe cohomotopy invariant is considered in the presence of a finite covering.\nThis setting naturally asks for the use of Borel cohomology equivariant with\nrespect to the group of deck transformations. Hence, a new equivariant contact\ninvariant is defined and its properties studied. The invariant is then computed\nin one concrete example, wherein the author demonstrates that it opens the\npossibility of considering scenarios hitherto inaccessible.\n",

In particular, when the surface has boundary, we show that the\nkernel of the Calabi homomorphism on the group of hameomorphisms is not simple,\nanswering an old question of Oh and M\\\"uller; this contrasts the smooth case,\nwhere the kernel of Calabi is simple. We similarly show that the group of\nhameomorphisms of the two-sphere is not simple. Related considerations allow us\nto extend the Calabi homomorphism to the full group of compactly supported\narea-preserving homeomorphisms, answering a longstanding question of Fathi. In\nfact, we produce infinitely many distinct extensions.\n  Central to the applications is that we show that the subleading asymptotics\nfor smooth, possibly time-dependent, Hamiltonians are always $O(1)$, and for\ncertain autonomous maps recover the Ruelle invariant.

We extend the Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection to relative cyclic\nhomology. Then, we construct (under simplifying technical assumptions) a\nrelative cyclic open-closed map, which maps the relative cyclic homology of a\nLagrangian $L$ in the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold $X$ to the\n$S^1$-equivariant relative quantum homology of $(X,L)$. Relative quantum\nhomology is the dual to the relative quantum cohomology constructed by\nSolomon-Tukachinsky. This is an extension of quantum cohomology, and comes\nequipped with a connection extending the quantum connection. We prove that the\nrelative open-closed map respects connections. As an application of this\nframework, we show, assuming a construction of the relative cyclic open-closed\nmap in a broader technical setup, that the Fukaya category of a Calabi-Yau\nvariety determines the open Gromov-Witten invariants with one interior marked\npoint for any null-homologous Lagrangian brane.\n",

Several key properties are proved,\nwhich include stability with respect to the Shelukhin-Hofer norm in contact\ngeometry and a triangle inequality of contact spectral invariants.

Intuitively, the\ntwisting index encodes how the structure in a neighborhood of a focus-focus\nfiber compares to the large-scale structure of the semitoric system and it was\noriginally defined by comparing certain momentum maps.\n  In the first half of the present paper, we produce several new formulations\nof the twisting index which give rise to dynamical, geometric, and topological\ninterpretations. More specifically, we describe it in terms of differences of\naction variables, Taylor series, and homology cycles. In the second half of the\npaper, we compute the twisting index invariant of a specific family of systems\nwith two focus-focus singular points (the so-called generalized coupled angular\nmomenta), which is the first time that the twisting index has been computed for\na system with more than one focus-focus point. Moreover, we also compute the\nterms of the Taylor series invariant up to second order.

This encompasses both\nthe classification of symplectic toric manifolds (due to Delzant) in terms of\nDelzant polytopes and the classification of proper Lagrangian fibrations over\nan integral affine base manifold (due to Duistermaat) in terms of a sheaf\ncohomology group.

The obstruction to existence is encoded\nby a degree two class in this cohomology: the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class.\nIn addition to the above, we introduce another invariant, which leads to a\nvariation of our classification result involving only classical sheaf\ncohomology and the group cohomology of certain modules for the isotropy groups\nof the groupoid.\n",

The latter are line segments that\nenter the polytope at an interior point of a facet and whose direction is\nintegrally transverse to this facet. A point inside the polytope is\ndisplaceable by a probe if it lies less than half way along it. Using a\nconstruction due to Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono, we show that every rational polytope\nhas a central point that is not displaceable by probes. In the monotone (or\nmore generally, the reflexive) case, this central point is its unique interior\nintegral point. In the monotone case, every other point is displaceable by\nprobes if and only if the polytope satisfies the star Ewald condition. (This is\na strong version of the Ewald conjecture concerning the integral symmetric\npoints in the polytope.) Further, in dimensions up to and including three every\nmonotone polytope is star Ewald. These results are closely related to the\nFukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono calculations of the Floer homology of the Lagrangian fibers\nof a toric symplectic manifold, and have applications to questions introduced\nby Entov-Polterovich about the displaceability of these fibers.\n",

When M is a Kahler manifold which is not a union of its proper\nsubvarieties (such a manifold is called Campana simple) these Kahler cones can\nbe described explicitly using the Demailly and Paun structure theorem.

For this we introduce the notion of an\nantiderivative (or circulation function) on a measured graph, the Reeb graph\nassociated to the vorticity function on the surface, while the criterion is\nrelated to the total negativity of this antiderivative. It turns out that given\ntopology of the vorticity function, the set of coadjoint orbits of the\nsymplectomorphism group admitting steady flows with this topology forms a\nconvex polytope. As a byproduct of the proposed construction, we also describe\na complete list of Casimirs for the 2D Euler hydrodynamics: we define\ngeneralized enstrophies which, along with circulations, form a complete set of\ninvariants for coadjoint orbits of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on a\nsurface.\n",

Previously, such invariants were known only in\ndimensions $2$ and $3$ from the work of Welschinger. Our approach does not\nrequire the Lagrangian to be fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, but can\nuse such an involution, if present, to obtain stronger results. Also,\nnon-trivial invariants are defined for broader classes of interior constraints\nand Lagrangian submanifolds than previously possible even in the presence of an\nanti-symplectic involution. The invariants of the present work specialize to\ninvariants of Welschinger, Fukaya, and Georgieva in many instances.\n  The main obstacle to defining open Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary\nconstraints in arbitrary dimension is the bubbling of $J$-holomorphic disks.\nUnlike in low dimensions or for interior constraints, disk bubbles do not\ncancel in pairs by anti-symplectic involution symmetry. Rather, we use the\ntechnique of bounding chains introduced in Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's work on\nLagrangian Floer theory to cancel disk bubbling. At the same time and\nindependently, gauge equivalence classes of bounding chains play the role of\nboundary constraints, in place of the cohomology classes that usually serve as\nconstraints in Gromov-Witten theory. A crucial step in our construction is to\nidentify a canonical up to gauge equivalence family of \"point-like\" bounding\nchains, which specialize in dimensions $2$ and $3$ to the point constraints\nconsidered by Welschinger.\n",

We apply the\ntechniques employed in Chan-Lau-Leung [8] and Chan [6], which give the SYZ\nmirror construction for D-branes. Recently, Chan-Lau-Leung [8] has given an\nexplicit mirror construction for toric Calabi-Yau manifolds as complex\nalgebraic varieties. Inspired by the SYZ transformation of D-branes in\nLeung-Yau-Zaslow[29], Chan[6] has defined a generalised mirror construction for\na larger class of Lagrangian subspaces, which is important to our situation.\nThe results point towards a need for further quantum correction of the SYZ\ntransform for Lagrangian subspaces in order to recover physicists mirror\nprediction of counting holomorphic discs in Ooguri-Vafa [34]. When compare to\nphysicists prediction of the Aganagic-Vafa mirror branes, such naive SYZ\ntransform fails to coincide with the prediction. The main reasons lies in the\nfact that the SYZ transformation does not capture open Gromov-Witten invariants\nof the A-brane. Through the special case of Aganagic-Vafa A-branes, we are able\nto modify the SYZ transform that involves further quantum correction using\ndiscs counting of the A-brane. However it is not known how such a modified SYZ\ntransform can be constructed and works in general. We believe that the explicit\nformulas and computations in the special case we consider here can give hints\nto the correct modification in general in future development of the SYZ\nprogramme.\n",

In symplectic and contact dynamics and geometry\nthey have become a principal tool, with applications that go far beyond the\nArnol'd conjectures: The proof of the Conley conjecture and of many instances\nof the Weinstein conjecture, rigidity results on Lagrangian submanifolds and on\nthe group of symplectomorphisms, lower bounds for the topological entropy of\nReeb flows and obstructions to symplectic embeddings are just some of the\napplications of Floer's seminal ideas. Other Floer homologies are of\ntopological nature. Among their applications are Property P for knots and the\nconstruction of compact topological manifolds of dimension greater than five\nthat are not triangulisable.\n  This is by no means a comprehensive survey on the presently known Floer\nhomologies and their applications. Such a survey would take several hundred\npages. We just describe some of the most classical versions and applications,\ntogether with the results that we know or like best. The text is written for\nnon-specialists, and the focus is on ideas rather than generality. Two\nintermediate sections recall basic notions and concepts from symplectic\ndynamics and geometry.\n",

We establish\nthe Gromov-Floer-Hofer type convergence result for contact instantons of finite\nenergy and construct its compactification of the moduli space, first by\ndefining the correct energy and then by proving uniform a priori energy bounds\nin terms of the oscillation of the relevant contact Hamiltonian.

The\nmain directions pursued in this article are: (1) given two periodic orbits,\ndecide when they can be connected by a regular family; (2) use numerical\ninvariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the\npresence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign +/- to each elliptic or hyperbolic\nFloquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, generalizing the classical\nKrein--Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the\nabove in a visual, easily implementable and resource-efficient way. The\nmathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors, where the\n``Broucke stability diagram'' was rediscovered, but further refined with the\nabove signs, and algebraically reformulated in terms of GIT quotients of the\nsymplectic group. The advantage of the above framework is that it applies to\nthe study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. Moreover, in the\ncase where the system admits symmetries in the form of ``reflections'', i.e.\nanti-symplectic involutions, which is the case for many systems of interest,\nthe information provided for orbits which are symmetric is richer, and one may\ndistinguish more symmetric orbits.

Apart from establishing $C^0$-bounds in order to be able to deal with\nnoncompact hyperk\\\"ahler manifolds, the core ingredient is a regularization\nscheme for the polysymplectic formalism due to Bridges, which allows us to link\nEuclidean field theory with hyperk\\\"ahler Floer theory.

Secondly, we examine a\none-parameter family of K\\\"ahler polarizations $\\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$, defined via\nsymplectic potentials, and demonstrate their convergence to $\\mathcal{P}_{k}$.\nThirdly, we verify that these polarizations $\\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$ coincide with\nthose induced by imaginary-time flow. Finally, we explore the relationship\nbetween the quantum space $\\mathcal{H}_{k,0}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{k}$,\nestablishing that ``$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathcal{H}_{k,t} =\n\\mathcal{H}_{k}$.\"\n",

We work out an abstract\nversion of it which does not involve troublesome quadratic estimates.\n",

We emphasize two points of view on the subject: the one based on\nthe ideas of deformation quantization and the one based on the ideas of Floer\ntheory. Their equivalence is a corollary of our generalized Riemann-Hilbert\ncorrespondence. In the case of exponential integrals this amounts to several\ncomparison isomorphisms between local and global versions of de Rham and Betti\ncohomology. We develop the corresponding theories in particular generalizing\nMorse-Novikov theory to the holomorphic case. We prove that arising\nwall-crossing structures are analytic. As a corollary, perturbative expansions\nof exponential integrals are resurgent. Based on a careful study of\nfinite-dimensional exponential integrals we propose a conjectural approach to\ninfinite-dimensional exponential integrals. We illustrate this approach in the\ncase of Feynman path integral with holomorphic Lagrangian boundary conditions\nas well as in the case of the complexified Chern-Simons theory. We discuss the\narising perverse sheaf of infinite rank as well as analyticity of the\ncorresponding ``Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure\". We develop a general\ntheory of quantum wave functions and show that in the case of Chern-Simons\ntheory it gives an alternative description of the Chern-Simons wall-crossing\nstructure based on the notion of generalized Nahm sum. We propose several\nconjectures about analyticity and resurgence of the corresponding perturbative\nseries.\n",
