Links are made to the study of ergodic Schrodinger operators where one of\nour new results implies that, in complete generality, the spectral measure is\nsupported on a set of zero Hausdorff dimension (indeed, of capacity zero) in\nthe region of strictly positive Lyapunov exponent.

The spectrum of a J--sign-symmetric\nirreducible matrix is studied under assumptions that its second compound matrix\nis also J--sign-symmetric and irreducible.

Our proof regarding extensions of positive definite\nfunctions carries over mutatis mutandis to the case of conditionally negative\ndefinite functions, which has applications to Gaussian stochastic processes,\nwhose increments in mean-square are stationary (e.g., fractional Brownian\nmotion).\n",

We derive\nconditions on two sets of real numbers to be the spectra of the above Dirichlet\nand Neumann problems. Our solution for the inverse problems is constructive: we\nestablish algorithms to recover the mass distribution on the star graph (i.e.\nthe point masses and lengths of subintervals between them) from these two\nspectra and from the lengths of the separate strings. If the root is a pendant\nvertex, the two spectra uniquely determine the parameters on the main string\n(i.e. the string incident to the root) if the length of the main string is\nknown. The mass distribution on the other edges need not be unique; the reason\nfor this is the non-uniqueness caused by the non-strict interlacing of the\ngiven data in the case when the root is the central vertex.

We show that a generic\ntensor has no eigenvectors on $\\mathbb S$. Actually, we show that a generic\ntensor has no eigenvectors on a proper nonsingular projective variety in\n$\\mathbb P^n$. By these facts, we show that the coefficients of the\nE-characteristic polynomial are algebraically dependent. Actually, a certain\npower of the determinant of the tensor can be expressed through the\ncoefficients besides the constant term. Hence, a nonsingular tensor always has\nan E-eigenvector. When a tensor $\\mathcal T$ is nonsingular and symmetric, its\nE-eigenvectors are exactly the singular points of a class of hypersurfaces\ndefined by $\\mathcal T$ and a parameter. We give explicit factorization of the\ndiscriminant of this class of hypersurfaces, which completes Cartwright and\nStrumfels' formula. We show that the factorization contains the determinant and\nthe E-characteristic polynomial of the tensor $\\mathcal T$ as irreducible\nfactors.\n",

The known algebraic algorithms for the computation\nof the CPD are limited to cases where at least one of the factor matrices has\nfull column rank. In the paper we present an algebraic algorithm for the\ncomputation of the CPD in cases where none of the factor matrices has full\ncolumn rank.

Then, it is proven that\nthe positive semi-definiteness character of an even order symmetric Cauchy\ntensor can be equivalently checked by the monotone increasing property of a\nhomogeneous polynomial related to the Cauchy tensor. The homogeneous polynomial\nis strictly monotone increasing in the nonnegative orthant of the Euclidean\nspace when the even order symmetric Cauchy tensor is positive definite.\nFurthermore, we prove that the Hadamard product of two positive semi-definite\n(positive definite respectively) symmetric Cauchy tensors is a positive\nsemi-definite (positive definite respectively) tensor, which can be generalized\nto the Hadamard product of finitely many positive semi-definite (positive\ndefinite respectively) symmetric Cauchy tensors. At last, bounds of the largest\nH-eigenvalue of a positive semi-definite symmetric Cauchy tensor are given and\nseveral spectral properties on Z-eigenvalues of odd order symmetric Cauchy\ntensors are shown. Further questions on Cauchy tensors are raised.\n",

It is proved\nthat, except in one special case where the scattering matrix has no bound\nstates and its value is $+1$ at zero energy, the determination by the\nscattering matrix is unique. In the special case, it is shown that there are\nexactly two distinct sets consisting of a potential and a boundary parameter\nyielding the same scattering matrix, and a characterization of the\nnonuniqueness is provided. A reconstruction from the scattering matrix is\noutlined yielding all the corresponding potentials and boundary parameters. The\nconcept of \"eligible resonances\" is introduced, and such resonances correspond\nto real-energy resonances that can be converted into bound states via a Darboux\ntransformation without changing the compact support of the potential. It is\nproved that the determination of the boundary parameter and the potential by\nthe absolute value of the Jost function is unique up to the inclusion of\neligible resonances. Several equivalent characterizations are provided to\ndetermine whether a resonance is eligible or ineligible. A reconstruction from\nthe absolute value of the Jost function is given, yielding all the\ncorresponding potentials and boundary parameters.

Moreover, a properly translated and modulated version of\n$\\phi_m$ is also an approximate eigenvector of this operator, and it satisfies\nthe properties that characterize the true eigenvector associated to the $m$-th\nlargest (in modulus) negative eigenvalue. The results hold at the edge of the\nspectrum, for any choice of $\\theta$ and under very mild conditions on $\\alpha$\nand $\\beta$.

We\nalso establish that all the H-eigenvalues of nonnegative Cauchy tensors are\nnonnegative. Secondly, we present new mathematical properties of Hankel\ntensors. { We prove that an even order Hankel tensor is Vandermonde positive\nsemi-definite if and only if its associated plane tensor is positive\nsemi-definite. We also show that, if the Vandermonde rank of a Hankel tensor\n$\\mathcal{A}$ is less than the dimension of the underlying space, then positive\nsemi-definiteness of $\\mathcal{A}$ is equivalent to the fact that $\\mathcal{A}$\nis a complete Hankel tensor, and so, is further equivalent to the SOS property\nof $\\mathcal{A}$.

We call the algorithm \"algebraic\" because it\nrelies only on standard linear algebra. It does not involve more advanced\nprocedures than the computation of the null space of a matrix and\neigen/singular value decomposition. Simulations indicate that the new\nconditions for uniqueness and the working assumptions for the algorithm hold\nfor a randomly generated $I\\times J\\times K$ tensor of rank $R\\geq K\\geq J\\geq\nI\\geq 2$ if $R$ is bounded as $R\\leq (I+J+K-2)/2 + (K-\\sqrt{(I-J)^2+4K})/2$ at\nleast for the dimensions that we have tested. This improves upon the famous\nKruskal bound for uniqueness $R\\leq (I+J+K-2)/2$ as soon as $I\\geq 3$.\n  In the particular case $R=K$, the new bound above is equivalent to the bound\n$R\\leq(I-1)(J-1)$ which is known to be necessary and sufficient for the generic\nuniqueness of the CPD. An existing algebraic algorithm (based on simultaneous\ndiagonalization of a set of matrices) computes the CPD under the more\nrestrictive constraint $R(R-1)\\leq I(I-1)J(J-1)/2$ (implying that\n$R<(J-\\frac{1}{2})(I-\\frac{1}{2})/\\sqrt{2}+1$). On the other hand,\noptimization-based algorithms fail to compute the CPD in a reasonable amount of\ntime even in the low-dimensional case $I=3$, $J=7$, $K=R=12$. By comparison, in\nour approach the computation takes less than $1$ sec.

It is proved\nthat the system of root functions of a linear boundary value problem\nconstitutes a Riesz basis in $L^2[0,1] \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2$ provided that the\nboundary conditions are strictly regular.\n  By analogy with the case of ordinary differential equations, boundary\nconditions are called strictly regular if the eigenvalues of the corresponding\nunperturbed $(Q=0)$ operator are asymptotically simple and separated. As\ndistinguished from the Dirac case there is no simple algebraic criterion of the\nstrict regularity whenever $b_1 + b_2 \\not = 0$. However under certain\nrestrictions on coefficients of the boundary linear forms we present certain\nalgebraic criteria of the strict regularity in the latter case. In particular,\nit is shown that regular separated boundary conditions are always strictly\nregular while periodic (antiperiodic) boundary conditions are strictly regular\nif and only if $b_1 + b_2 \\not = 0.$\n  The proof of the main result is based on existence of triangular\ntransformation operators for system (1).

This generalization is defined for tensors of any order (even\nor odd), while it reduces to the class of nonnegative positive semidefinite\ntensors in the even order case. We show that many nonnegative structured\ntensors, which are positive semidefinite in the even order case, are indeed\ndoubly nonnegative as well in the odd order case. As an important subclass of\ndoubly nonnegative tensors, the completely positive tensors are further\nstudied. By using dominance properties for completely positive tensors, we can\neasily exclude some doubly nonnegative tensors, such as the signless Laplacian\ntensor of a nonempty $m$-uniform hypergraph with $m\\geq 3$, from the class of\ncompletely positive tensors. Properties of the doubly nonnegative tensor cone\nand the completely positive tensor cone are established. Their relation and\ndifference are discussed. These show us a different phenomenon comparing to the\nmatrix case. By employing the proposed properties, more subclasses of these two\ntypes of tensors are identified. Particularly, all positive Cauchy tensors with\nany order are shown to be completely positive. This gives an easily\nconstructible subclass of completely positive tensors, which is significant for\nthe study of completely positive tensor decomposition.

Furthermore, in this case, the\nextremal H-eigenvalues of the higher order tensor are bounded by the extremal\nH-eigenvalues of the lower order tensor, multiplied with some constants. Based\non this inheritance property, we give a concrete sum-of-squares decomposition\nfor each strong Hankel tensor. Then we prove the second inheritance property of\nHankel tensors, i.e., a Hankel tensor has no negative (or non-positive, or\npositive, or nonnegative) H-eigenvalues if the associated Hankel matrix of that\nHankel tensor has no negative (or non-positive, or positive, or nonnegative,\nrespectively) eigenvalues. In this case, the extremal H-eigenvalues of the\nHankel tensor are also bounded by the extremal eigenvalues of the associated\nHankel matrix, multiplied with some constants. The third inheritance property\nof Hankel tensors is raised as a conjecture.\n",

This paper is devoted to\na semi-definite program algorithm for computing the maximum $H$-eigenvalue of a\nclass of tensors with sign structure called $W$-tensors. The class of\n$W$-tensors extends the well-studied nonnegative tensors and essentially\nnonnegative tensors, and covers some important tensors arising naturally from\nspectral hypergraph theory. Our algorithm is based on a new structured\nsums-of-squares (SOS) decomposition result for a nonnegative homogeneous\npolynomial induced by a $W$-tensor. This SOS decomposition enables us to show\nthat computing the maximum $H$-eigenvalue of an even order symmetric $W$-tensor\nis equivalent to solving a semi-definite program, and hence can be accomplished\nin polynomial time. Numerical examples are given to illustrate that the\nproposed algorithm can be used to find maximum $H$-eigenvalue of an even order\nsymmetric $W$-tensor with dimension up to $10,000$. We present two applications\nfor our proposed algorithm: we first provide a polynomial time algorithm for\ncomputing the maximum $H$-eigenvalues of large size Laplacian tensors of\nhyper-stars and hyper-trees; second, we show that the proposed SOS algorithm\ncan be used to test the copositivity of a multivariate form associated with\nsymmetric extended $Z$-tensors, whose order may be even or odd. Numerical\nexperiments illustrate that our structured semi-definite program algorithm is\neffective and promising.\n",

While plugging the relaxation to guarantee the decrease of the\nobjective value in the feasible set, from which both the inverse power (IP)\nmethod and the steepest descent (SD) method can also be recovered, we are able\nto get two specified CD methods.

It reflects the inner\ninformation structure of the sequences. A fractional period is not uncommon in\ntime series. A typical example is the 3.6 period in protein sequences, which\ndetermines the $\\alpha$-helix secondary structure. Computing the spectrum of a\nfractional period offers a high-resolution insight into a time series. It has\nthus become an important approach in genomic analysis. However, computing\nFourier spectra of fractional periods by the traditional Fourier transform is\ncomputationally expensive. In this paper, we present a novel, fast algorithm\nfor directly computing the fractional period spectrum (FPS) of time series. The\nalgorithm is based on the periodic distribution of signal strength at periodic\npositions of the time series. We provide theoretical analysis, deduction, and\nspecial techniques for reducing the computational costs of the algorithm. The\nanalysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm shows that the\nalgorithm is much faster than traditional Fourier transform. Our algorithm can\nbe applied directly in computing fractional periods in time series from a broad\nof research fields.

It is known that the\nspectrum of the purely periodic case without the defect and its limit, as the\nperiod $\\varepsilon$ goes to zero, has a band-gap structure.

It contains six edges (three convex and three non-convex) and two\ncorners (one convex and one non-convex). It is a canonical example of\nnon-smooth conical layer. We name it after Fichera because near its non-convex\ncorner, it coincides with the famous Fichera cube that illustrates the\ninteraction between edge and corner singularities. This domain could also be\ncalled an octant layer.\n  We show that the essential spectrum of the Laplacian on such a domain is a\nhalf-line and we characterize its minimum as the first eigenvalue of the\ntwo-dimensional Laplacian on a broken guide. By a Born-Oppenheimer type\nstrategy, we also prove that its discrete spectrum is finite and that a lower\nbound is given by the ground state of a special Sturm-Liouville operator. By\nfinite element computations taking singularities into account, we exhibit\nexactly one eigenvalue under the essential spectrum threshold leaving a\nrelative gap of 3%. We extend these results to a variant of the Fichera layer\nwith rounded edges (for which we find a very small relative gap of 0.5%), and\nto a three-dimensional cross where the three walls are full thickened planes.\n",

In an earlier work we calculated the leading term\nfor the eigenvalue counting function for operators coming from resistance forms\nthat were introduced by Alonso-Ruiz, Freiberg and Kigami. In this work we want\nto refine the results. The next question that arises is if there are\noscillations in the leading term which are typical for highly symmetrical\nfractals. We have to distinguish between the existence of a periodic function\nin front of the leading term and oscillations in general. The first one is\nunlikely as we will see, however the second one still holds. This means there\nare oscillations in the leading term, but these will not have this very strict\nperiodic behaviour that we know of the Sierpinski Gasket. We will show, that\nthere exist localized eigenfunctions on the SSG which have eigenvalues with\nvery high multiplicities. However in contrast to the self-similar case this\nfact alone is not enough to show that there can't be convergence. We need to\nuse another method to show the existence of oscillations.\n",

Because of its uniqueness properties the CPD has\nfound many concrete applications in telecommunication, array processing,\nmachine learning, etc. On the other hand, in several applications the rank-1\nconstraint on the terms is too restrictive. A multilinear rank-$(M,N,L)$\nconstraint (where a rank-1 term is the special case for which $M=N=L=1$) could\nbe more realistic, while it still yields a decomposition with attractive\nuniqueness properties. In this paper we focus on the decomposition of a tensor\n$\\mathcal T$ into a sum of multilinear rank-$(1,L_r,L_r)$ terms, $r=1,...,R$.\nThis particular decomposition type has already found applications in wireless\ncommunication, chemometrics and the blind signal separation of signals that can\nbe modelled as exponential polynomials and rational functions. We find\nconditions on the terms which guarantee that the decomposition is unique and\ncan be computed by means of the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix even in\nthe cases where none of the factor matrices has full column rank. We consider\nboth the case where the decomposition is exact and the case where the\ndecomposition holds only approximately. We show that in both cases the number\nof the terms $R$ and their \"sizes\" $L_1,...,L_R$ do not have to be known a\npriori and can be estimated as well. The conditions for uniqueness are easy to\nverify, especially for terms that can be considered \"generic\". In particular,\nwe obtain the following two generalizations of a well known result on generic\nuniqueness of the CPD (i.e., the case $L_1=...=L_R=1$): we show that the\nmultilinear rank-$(1,L_r,L_r)$ decomposition of an $I\\times J\\times K$ tensor\nis generically unique if i) $L_1=...=L_R=:L$ and $R\\leq\\min((J-L)(K-L),I)$ or\nif ii) $\\sum L_R\\leq\\min((I-1)(J-1),K)$ and $J\\geq\\max(L_i+L_j)$.\n",

For a fixed boundary condition, unlike in the continuous case, the\n$n$-th eigenvalue exhibits jump phenomena and we describe the singularity under\na non-degenerate assumption. Compared with the continuous case in [8, 12], the\nsingular set here is involved heavily with coefficients of the Sturm-Liouville\nequations. This, along with arbitrariness of the dimension, causes difficulty\nwhen dividing areas in layers of the considered space such that the $n$-th\neigenvalue has the same singularity in any given area. We study the singularity\nby partitioning and analyzing the local coordinate systems, and provide a\nHermitian matrix which can determine the areas' division. To prove the\nasymptotic behavior of the $n$-th eigenvalue, we generalize the method\ndeveloped in [21] to any dimension.

Several different symmetry structures are considered\nand it is shown that for most of the structures, the generic change in the\neigenvalues is analogous to the case of generic perturbations that ignore the\nstructure. However, for some odd/even and palindromic structures, there is a\ndifferent behavior for the eigenvalues $0$ and $\\infty$, respectively $+1$ and\n$-1$. The differences arise in those cases where the parity of the partial\nmultiplicities in the perturbed pencil provided by the generic behavior in the\ngeneral structure-ignoring case is not in accordance with the restrictions\nimposed by the structure. The new results extend results for the rank-$1$ and\nrank-$2$ cases that were obtained in [L. Batzke, Generic Low-Rank Perturbations\nof Structured Regular Matrix Pencils and Structured Matrices, PhD Thesis, TU\nBerlin, Berlin, Germany, 2015] and [L.

As the main tool, we use\ndecompositions of matrix pencils with symmetry structure into sums of rank-one\npencils, as those allow a parametrization of the set of matrix pencils with a\ngiven symmetry structure and a given rank.\n",

Further results\ninclude: computing spectra of (possibly unbounded) operators on graphs and\nseparable Hilbert spaces with error control; determining if the spectrum\nintersects a compact set; the computational spectral gap problem and computing\nspectral classifications at the bottom of the spectrum; and computing discrete\nspectra, multiplicities, eigenspaces and determining if the discrete spectrum\nis non-empty.

However, in many\napplications gaining an approximation of the spectrum is not enough. Often it\nis vital to determine geometric features of spectra such as Lebesgue measure,\ncapacity or fractal dimensions, different types of spectral radii and numerical\nranges, or to detect essential spectral gaps and the corresponding failure of\nthe finite section method. Despite new results on computing spectra and the\nsubstantial interest in these geometric problems, there remain no general\nmethods able to compute such geometric features of spectra of\ninfinite-dimensional operators. We provide the first algorithms for the\ncomputation of many of these longstanding problems (including the above). As\ndemonstrated with computational examples, the new algorithms yield a library of\nnew methods. Recent progress in computational spectral problems in infinite\ndimensions has led to the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which\nclassifies the difficulty of computational problems. These results reveal that\ninfinite-dimensional spectral problems yield an intricate infinite\nclassification theory determining which spectral problems can be solved and\nwith which type of algorithm. This is very much related to S. Smale's\ncomprehensive program on the foundations of computational mathematics initiated\nin the 1980s. We classify the computation of geometric features of spectra in\nthe SCI hierarchy, allowing us to precisely determine the boundaries of what\ncomputers can achieve (in any model of computation) and prove that our\nalgorithms are optimal. We also provide a new universal technique for\nestablishing lower bounds in the SCI hierarchy, which both greatly simplifies\nprevious SCI arguments and allows new, formerly unattainable, classifications.\n",

Another aim is to emphasize that the spectrum of a differential operator\non a bounded domain or bounded interval is not necessarily discrete, that is,\neigenvalues of infinite multiplicity, continuous spectrum, and eigenvalues\nembedded in the continuous spectrum may be present. This unusual spectral\neffect is, very roughly speaking, caused by (at least) one of the following\nthree reasons: The bounded domain has a rough boundary, the potential is\nsingular, or the boundary condition is nonstandard. In three separate explicit\nconstructions we demonstrate how each of these possibilities leads to a\nSchr\\\"odinger operator with prescribed essential spectrum.\n",

In many\napplications one is interested in establishing conditions which guarantee the\npositive semi-definiteness of the matrix. In this paper we present an\ninequality on the eigenvalues of a weighted graph Laplacian (where the weights\nneed not have any particular sign) in terms of the first two moments of the\nedge weights. This bound involves the eigenvalues of the equally weighted\nLaplacian on the graph as well as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of\nthe line graph (the edge-to-vertex dual graph). For a regular graph the bound\ncan be expressed entirely in terms of the second eigenvalue of the equally\nweighted Laplacian, an object that has been extensively studied in connection\nwith expander graphs and spectral measures of graph connectivity.

A\nfirst natural extension is the theory of several complex variables whose Cauchy\nformula is used to define the holomorphic functional calculus for $n$-tuples of\noperators $(A_1,...,A_n)$. A second way is to consider hyperholomorphic\nfunctions of quaternionic or paravector variables. In this case, by the\nFueter-Sce-Qian mapping theorem, we have two different notions of\nhyperholomorphic functions that are called slice hyperholomorphic functions and\nmonogenic functions. Slice hyperholomorphic functions generate the spectral\ntheory based on the $S$-spectrum while monogenic functions induce the spectral\ntheory based on the monogenic spectrum. There is also an interesting relation\nbetween the two hyperholomorphic spectral theories via the $F$-functional\ncalculus. The two hyperholomorphic spectral theories have different and\ncomplementary applications. Here we also discuss how to define the fractional\nFourier's law for nonhomogeneous materials, such definition is based on the\nspectral theory on the $S$-spectrum.\n",

We are interested in the following problem: is it true that every\nfinite dimensional variety is spanned by moment functions? Let $m$ be an\nexponential on $X$. In our former paper we have proved that if the linear space\nof all $m$-sine functions in the variety of an $m$-exponential monomial is (at\nmost) one dimensional, then this variety is spanned by moment functions\ngenerated by $m$. In this paper we show that this may happen also in cases\nwhere the $m$-sine functions span a more than one dimensional subspace in the\nvariety. We recall the notion of a polynomial hypergroup in $d$ variables,\ndescribe exponentials on it and give the characterization of the so called\n$m$-sine functions. Next we show that the Fourier algebra of a polynomial\nhypergroup in $d$ variables is the polynomial ring in $d$ variables. Finally,\nusing Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Theorem we show that every exponential polynomial\non the polynomial hypergroup in $d$ variables is a linear combination of moment\nfunctions contained in its variety.\n",

We also establish a simple criterion for\nnon-accumulation of eigenvalues on the imaginary axis as well as resolvent\nestimates.

For an unbounded\nclosed operator, it is defined, as in the classical case, using an appropriate\ntransformation and the $S$-functional calculus for bounded operators. This is\nhowever only possible if the $S$-resolvent set of the operator contains a real\npoint.\n  In this paper, we define the $S$-functional calculus directly via a Cauchy\nintegral, which allows us to consider also operators whose resolvent sets do\nnot contain real points. We show that the product rule and the spectral mapping\ntheorem also hold true with this definition and that the $S$-functional\ncalculus is compatible with polynomials, although polynomials are not included\nin the set of admissible functions if the operator is unbounded.\n  We also prove that the $S$-functional calculus is able to create spectral\nprojections. In order to do this, we remove another assumption usually made: we\ndo not assume that admissible functions are defined on slice domains. Instead,\nwe also consider functions that are defined on not necessarily connected sets.\nThis leads to an unexpected phenomenon: the $S$-functional calculi for left and\nright slice hyperholomorphic functions become inconsistent and give different\noperators for functions that are both left and right slice hyperholomorphic. We\nshow that any such function is the sum of a locally constant and an intrinsic\nfunction. For intrinsic functions both functional calculi agree, but for\nlocally constant functions they must give different operators unless any\nspectral projection commutes with arbitrary scalars.\n",

In\nthis paper it will be shown that the mathematical model in single-photon\napproximation may predict another behavior of this probability generally.\nNamely, the probability to find the atom in the excited state may tend to a\nnonzero constant so that the atom is not in the pure state finally.

The main results\nconcern the factorization of elliptic operator pencils satisfying the resolvent\ngrowth condition in a double sector containing the real axis and the\ninvestigation of the semi-group properties of a divisor.

We show\nthat a T-symmetric tensor has unique largest and smallest eigentuples, and a\nT-quadratic form is positive semi-definite (definite) if and only if its\nsmallest eigentuple is nonnegative (positive). The relation between the\neigen-decomposition of T-symmetric tensors, and the TSVD of general third order\ntensors are also studied.\n",

De Branges' inverse spectral theorem states that\nthe assignment $H\\mapsto q_H$ is a bijection between Hamiltonians (suitably\nnormalised) and Nevanlinna functions.\n  The main result of the paper is a criterion when the singular integral of the\nspectral measure, i.e. Re $q_H(iy)$, dominates its Poisson integral Im\n$q_H(iy)$ for $y\\to+\\infty$. Two equivalent conditions characterising this\nsituation are provided. The first one is analytic in nature, very simple, and\nexplicit in terms of the primitive $M$ of $H$. It merely depends on the\nrelative size of the off-diagonal entries of $M$ compared with the diagonal\nentries. The second condition is of geometric nature and technically more\ncomplicated, but explicit in terms of $H$ itself. It involves the relative size\nof the off-diagonal entries of $H$, a measurement for oscillations of the\ndiagonal of $H$, and a condition on the speed and smoothness of the rotation of\n$H$.\n",

The spectrum is intrinsically\nlinked to the geometry of the surface. In this work, we consider surfaces of\nconstant negative curvature with a large symmetry group. It is not possible to\ncalculate explicitly the eigenvalues for surfaces in this class, so we combine\ngroup theoretic and analytical methods to derive results about the spectrum.\n  In particular, we focus on the Bolza surface and the Klein quartic. These\nhave the highest order symmetry groups among compact Riemann surfaces of genera\n2 and 3 respectively. We analyse the irreducible representations of the full\nisomorphism group of the Bolza surface and prove that the multiplicity of the\nfirst positive eigenvalue is 3, building on the work of Jenni, and identify the\nirreducible representation that corresponds to this eigenspace. This proof\nrelies on a certain conjecture, for which we give substantial numerical\nevidence and a hopeful method for proving. We go on to show that the second\ndistinct positive eigenvalue has multiplicity 4.\n",

From this viewpoint, individuals or, more generally,\nsocial stimuli are thought of as a weighted sum of harmonics with different\nfrequencies: Low frequencies represent general categories such as gender,\nethnic group, nationality, etc., whereas high frequencies account for personal\ncharacteristics. Individuals are then seen by observers as the output of a\nfilter that emphasizes a certain range of high or low frequencies. The\nselection of the filter depends on the social distance between the observing\nindividual or group and the person being observed as well as on motivation,\ncognitive resources and cultural background. Enhancing low- or high-frequency\nharmonics is not on equal footing, the latter requiring supplementary energy.\nThis mirrors a well-known property of signal processing filters. More\ngenerally, in the light of this correspondence, we show that several\nestablished results of social cognition admit a natural interpretation and\nintegration in the signal processing language. While the potential of this\nconnection between an area of social psychology and one of information\nengineering appears considerable (compression, information retrieval,\nfiltering, feedback, feedforward, sampling, aliasing, etc.), in this paper we\nshall limit ourselves to laying down what we consider the pillars of this\nbridge on which future research may be founded.\n",

A\nquantum graph is defined by having a Laplacian on each edge of a metric graph\nand imposing boundary conditions at the vertices to get an eigenvalue problem.\nA problem studying such quantum graphs is that the spectrum is timeconsuming to\ncompute by hand and the inverse problem of finding a quantum graph having a\nspecified spectrum is difficult. We solve the forward problem, to find the\neigenvalues, using a previously developed computer program. We obtain all\neigenvalues analytically for not too big graphs that have rationally dependent\nedges. We solve the inverse problem using \"spectrally grown graphs\". The\nspectrally grown graphs are evolved from a starting (parent) graph such that\nthe child graphs have eigenvalues are close to some criterion. Our experiments\nshow that the method works and we can usually find graphs having spectra which\nare numerically close to a prescribed spectrum. There are naturally exceptions,\nsuch as if no graph has the prescribed spectrum. The selection criteria (goals)\nstrongly influence the shape of the evolved graphs. Our experiments allows us\nto make new conjectures concerning the spectra of quantum graphs. We\nopen-source our software at https://github.com/meapistol/Spectra-of-graphs.\n",

Although a vast majority of studies in this direction\nconcern purely differential operators on graphs (often referred to as quantum\ngraphs), recently there also appeared some considerations of nonlocal operators\non star-type graphs. In particular, there belong functional-differential\noperators with constant delays but in a {\\it locally} nonlocal version. The\nlatter means that each edge of the graph has its own delay parameter, which\ndoes not affect any other edge. In this paper, we introduce {\\it globally}\nnonlocal operators that are expected to be more natural for modelling nonlocal\nprocesses on graphs. We also extend this idea to arbitrary trees, which opens a\nwide area of further research. Another goal of the paper is to study inverse\nspectral problems for operators with global delay in one illustrative case by\naddressing a wide range of questions including uniqueness, characterization of\nthe spectral data as well as the uniform stability.\n",

The charts linearize the flows,\nconverting it into a linear differential system with constant coefficients and\ndiagonal matrix. A variant construction transform the flows into uniform\nstraight line motion. Since limit points belong to the phase space, asymptotic\nbehavior becomes a local issue.

The\nuniqueness of recovering the potential and the polynomials from the Weyl\nfunction is proved. An algorithm of solving the inverse problem is obtained and\njustified. More concretely, we reduce the nonlinear inverse problem to a linear\nequation in the Banach space of bounded infinite sequences and then derive\nreconstruction formulas for the problem coefficients, which are new even for\nthe case of regular potential. Note that the spectral problem in this paper is\ninvestigated in the general non-self-adjoint form, and our method does not\nrequire the simplicity of the spectrum. In the future, our results can be\napplied to investigation of the inverse problem solvability and stability as\nwell as to development of numerical methods for the reconstruction.\n",

This last\nidea was introduced in [Jiang-Tidor-Yao-Zhang-Zhao, 2021] for similar spectral\npurposes in the context of graphs of bounded degree. Our method is robust\nenough to also yield an upper bound on the ``approximate multiplicity'' of\neigenvalues, i.e., the number of eigenvalues in windows of size\n$1/\\log^\\beta(g)$, $\\beta>0$.

A popular estimation method for\nsynchronization is the spectral method. It extracts the group elements from\neigenvectors of a block matrix formed from the measurements. The eigenvectors\nmust be projected, or \"rounded\", onto the group. The rounding procedures are\nconstructed ad hoc and increasingly so when applied to synchronization problems\nover non-compact groups.\n  In this paper, we develop a spectral approach to synchronization over the\nnon-compact group $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$, the group of rigid motions of\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. We based our method on embedding $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ into the\nalgebra of dual quaternions, which has deep algebraic connections with the\ngroup $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$. These connections suggest a natural rounding procedure\nconsiderably more straightforward than the current state-of-the-art for\nspectral $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ synchronization, which uses a matrix embedding of\n$\\mathrm{SE}(3)$. We show by numerical experiments that our approach yields\ncomparable results to the current state-of-the-art in $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$\nsynchronization via the spectral method. Thus, our approach reaps the benefits\nof the dual quaternion embedding of $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$, while yielding estimators\nof similar quality.\n",

The aim of this manuscript is\nto determine the location of right eigenvalues of $P(\\lambda)$ relative to\ncertain subsets of the set of quaternions. In particular, we extend the notion\nof (hyper)stability of complex matrix polynomials to quaternion matrix\npolynomials and obtain location of right eigenvalues of $P(\\lambda)$ using the\nfollowing methods: $(1)$ we give a relation between (hyper)stability of a\nquaternion matrix polynomial and its complex adjoint matrix polynomial, $(2)$\nwe prove that $P(\\lambda)$ is stable with respect to an open (closed) ball in\nthe set of quaternions, centered at a complex number if and only if it is\nstable with respect to its intersection with the set of complex numbers and\n$(3)$ as a consequence of $(1)$ and $(2)$, we prove that right eigenvalues of\n$P(\\lambda)$ lie between two concentric balls of specific radii in the set of\nquaternions centered at the origin. A generalization of the Enestr{\\\"o}m-Kakeya\ntheorem to quaternion matrix polynomials is obtained as an application.

We consider the non-self-adjoint\nSturm-Liouville problem that consists in the recovery of the potential and the\nparameters of the boundary conditions from the eigenvalues and the generalized\nweight numbers. The special case of simple eigenvalues, as well as the general\ncase with multiple eigenvalues are studied. We find various subsets in the\nspace of spectral data, on which the inverse mapping is Lipschitz continuous,\nand obtain the corresponding unconditional uniform stability estimates.\nFurthermore, the conditional uniform stability of the inverse problem under a\npriori restrictions on the potential is studied. In addition, we prove the\nuniform stability of the inverse problem by the Cauchy data, which are\nconvenient for numerical reconstruction of the potential and for applications\nto partial inverse problems.\n",

The Fueter-Sce\nextension theorem (often called Fueter-Sce mapping theorem) provides a two-step\nprocedure for extending holomorphic functions to hyperholomorphic functions. In\nthe first step, slice hyperholomorphic functions are obtained, and their\nassociated Cauchy formula establishes the $S$-functional calculus for\nnoncommuting operators on the $S$-spectrum. The second step produces axially\nmonogenic functions, which lead to the development of the monogenic functional\ncalculus. In this review paper we discuss the second operator in the Fueter-Sce\nmapping theorem that takes slice hyperholomorphic to axially monogenic\nfunctions. This operator admits several factorizations which generate various\nfunction spaces and their corresponding functional calculi, thereby forming the\nso-called fine structures of spectral theories on the $S$-spectrum.\n",

Additionally, we\npresent families of distance integral graphs, shedding light on a previously\nposted open problem given by Indulal and Balakrishnan in (AKCE International\nJournal of Graphs and Combinatorics, 13(3); 230 to 234, 2016).\n",

We\nconsider here three main cases of how to measure the distance between two\nbounded operators: first by taking the distance between their unitary orbits,\nsecond by isometric embeddings (this generalises a concept of Weidmann) and\nthird by quasi-unitary equivalence (using a concept of the first author of the\npresent article).\n  Our main result is that the unitary and isometric distances are equal\nprovided the operators are both self-adjoint and have $0$ in their essential\nspectra. Moreover, the quasi-unitary distance is equivalent (up to a universal\nconstant) with the isometric distance for any pair of bounded operators. The\nunitary distance gives an upper bound on the Hausdorff distance of their\nspectrum. If both operators have purely essential spectrum, then the unitary\ndistance equals the Hausdorff distance of their spectra. Using a finer spectral\ndistance respecting multiplicity of discrete eigenvalues, this spectral\ndistance equals the unitary distance also for operators with essential and\ndiscrete spectrum. In particular, all operator distances mentioned above are\nequal to this spectral distance resp. controlled by it in the quasi-unitary\ncase for self-adjoint operators with $0$ in the essential spectrum. We also\nshow that our results are sharp by presenting various (counter-)examples.\nFinally, we discuss related convergence concepts complementing results from our\nfirst article arXiv:2202.03234\n",

This is a special case of a broad class of problems that\narise repeatedly in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Here, sufficient\nconditions are found on A that determine orders in either direction. For a\ndiagonally symmetrizable nonnegative matrix A with all positive eigenvalues and\nnonnegative D, r(A^2 D) <= r(A) r(AD). The reverse holds if all of the\neigenvalues of A are negative besides the Perron root. This is a particular\ncase of the more general result that r(A [(1-m) r(B) I + m B] D) is monotonic\nin m when all non-Perron eigenvalues of A have the same sign --- decreasing for\npositive signs and increasing for negative signs, for symmetrizable nonnegative\nA and B that commute. Commuting matrices include the Kronecker products A, B in\n{\\otimes_{i=1}^L M_i^{t_i}}, t_i in {0, 1, 2, ...}, which comprise a class of\napplication for these results.

In this paper, we will\ngive an affirmative answer to this question and prove a bit more: both the\nmodularity and the normalized modularity matrix of a graph is negative\nsemidefinite if and only if the graph is complete or complete multipartite.\n",

As we will see,\nalready in the simplest case, the statements of the results in the\nsub-Riemannian setting are quite different from those in the Riemannian one.\nLet us consider a sub-Riemannian (sR) metric on a closed three-dimensional\nmanifold with an oriented contact distribution. There exists a privileged\nchoice of the contact form, with an associated Reeb vector field and a\ncanonical volume form that coincides with the Popp measure. We establish a\nQuantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of any associated sR\nLaplacian under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. The limit measure\nis given by the normalized Popp measure.This is the first time that such a\nresult is established for a hypoelliptic operator, whereas the usual Shnirelman\ntheorem yields QE for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed Riemannian\nmanifold with ergodic geodesic flow.To prove our theorem, we first establish a\nmicrolocal Weyl law, which allows us to identify the limit measure and to prove\nthe microlocal concentration of the eigenfunctions on the characteristic\nmanifold of the sR Laplacian. Then, we derive a Birkhoff normal form along this\ncharacteristic manifold, thus showing that, in some sense, all 3D contact\nstructures are microlocally equivalent. The quantum version of this normal form\nprovides a useful microlocal factorization of the sR Laplacian. Using the\nnormal form, the factorization and the ergodicity assumption, we finally\nestablish a variance estimate, from which QE follows.We also obtain a second\nresult, which is valid without any ergodicity assumption: every Quantum Limit\n(QL) can be decomposed in a sum of two mutually singular measures: the first\nmeasure is supported on the unit cotangent bundle and is invariant under the sR\ngeodesic flow, and the second measure is supported on the characteristic\nmanifold of the sR Laplacian and is invariant under the lift of the Reeb flow.\nMoreover, we prove that the first measure is zero for most QLs.\n",

Any spectral information\nabout L directly leads to estimates for the Hodge Laplacian H=(d+d^*)^2 and\nallows to estimate the spectrum of the Kirchhoff Laplacian H_0=d^* d. The\nhydrogen identity implies that the random walk u(n) = L^n u with integer n\nsolves the one-dimensional Jacobi equation Delta u=H^2 with (Delta\nu)(n)=u(n+2)-2 u(n)+u(n-2). Every solution is represented by such a reversible\npath integral. Over a finite field, we get a reversible cellular automaton. By\ntaking products of complexes such processes can be defined over any lattice\nZ^r. Since L^2 and L^(-2) are isospectral, by a theorem of Kirby, the matrix\nL^2 is always similar to a symplectic matrix if the graph has an even number of\nsimplices.

Since in real\nsystems the exact graph structure is not known, researchers resort to random\ngraphs to obtain eigenvalue properties from known structural features. However,\nthis theory is far from intuitive and often requires training of free\nprobability, cavity methods or a strong familiarity with probability theory. In\nthis note we offer a different perspective on this field by focusing on the\ncycles in a graph. We use the so-called method of moments to obtain relation\nbetween eigenvalues and cycle weights and then we obtain spectral properties of\nrandom graphs with cyclic motifs. We use it to explore properties of the\neigenvalues of adjacency matrices of graphs with short cycles and of circulant\ndirected graphs. Although our result is not as powerful as the some of the\nexisting methods, they are nevertheless useful and far easier to understand.\n",

Both the periodic background problem and the\nperturbed problem are modelled by a divergence type equation. A feature of our\nanalysis is that we allow discontinuities in the coefficients of the operator,\nwhich is required to model many photonic crystals. Using the Floquet-Bloch\ntheory in negative order Sobolev spaces, we characterize the precise number of\neigenvalues created by the line defect in terms of the band functions of the\noriginal periodic background medium for arbitrarily weak defects.\n",

The Steklov problem on planar domains with corners is\nclosely linked to the classical sloshing and sloping beach problems in\nhydrodynamics; as we show it is also related to quantum graphs. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the arithmetic properties of the angles of a curvilinear polygon\nhave a significant effect on the boundary behaviour of the Steklov\neigenfunctions.

The authors\nrecognized that in general the eigenvalues due not correspond to the spectrum\nof a compact operator and hence proposed a modified eigenvalue problem with the\ndesired properties. The Fredholmness and the approximation of both problems\nwere analyzed in [Halla, arXiv:1909.00689 (2019)]. The present work considers\nthe original eigenvalue problem in the selfadjoint case. We report that apart\nfor a countable set of particular frequencies, the spectrum consists of three\ndisjoint parts: The essential spectrum consisting of the point zero, an\ninfinite sequence of positive eigenvalues which accumulate only at infinity and\nan infinite sequence of negative eigenvalues which accumulate only at zero. The\nanalysis is based on a representation of the operator as block operator. For\nsmall/big enough eigenvalue parameter the Schur-complements with respect to\ndifferent components can be build. For each Schur-complement the existence of\nan infinite sequence of eigenvalues is proved via a fixed point technique\nsimilar to [Cakoni, Haddar, Applicable Analysis, 88:4, 475-493 (2009)].

This paper suggests a novel method for the classification\nof combinatorial fullerene isomers using spectral graph theory. The\nclassification presupposes an invariant scheme for the facets based on the\nSchlegel diagram. The main idea is to find clusters of isomers by analyzing\ntheir graph structure of hexagonal facets only. We also show that our\nclassification scheme can serve as a formal stability criterion, which became\nevident from a comparison of our results with recent quantum chemical\ncalculations. We apply our method to classify all isomers of $C_{60}$ and give\nan example of two different cospectral isomers of $C_{44}$. Calculations are\ndone with MATLAB. The only input for our algorithm is the vector of positions\nof pentagons in the facet spiral. These vectors and Schlegel diagrams are\ngenerated with the software package Fullerene.\n",

However, a fundamental theory supporting the practical\napplications is still in the early stages of development. We take a fresh look\nat neural networks and examine them via nonlinear eigenvalue analysis. The\nfield of nonlinear spectral theory is still emerging, providing insights about\nnonlinear operators and systems. In this paper we view a neural network as a\ncomplex nonlinear operator and attempt to find its nonlinear eigenvectors. We\nfirst discuss the existence of such eigenvectors and analyze the kernel of ReLU\nnetworks. Then we study a nonlinear power method for generic nonlinear\noperators. For proximal operators associated to absolutely one-homogeneous\nconvex regularization functionals, we can prove convergence of the method to an\neigenvector of the proximal operator. This motivates us to apply a nonlinear\nmethod to networks which are trained to act similarly as a proximal operator.\nIn order to take the non-homogeneity of neural networks into account we define\na modified version of the power method.\n  We perform extensive experiments for different proximal operators and on\nvarious shallow and deep neural networks designed for image denoising. Proximal\neigenvectors will be used for geometric analysis of graphs, as clustering or\nthe computation of distance functions. For simple neural nets, we observe the\ninfluence of training data on the eigenvectors.

In the two-dimensional case this implies that the\nconstant term of the expansion contains a non-local term that determines the\nlength of the (circular) cross section and vanishes precisely if this length\nequals $2\\pi$, that is, in the smooth case. We proceed to the study of higher\ndimensions. In the four-dimensional case, the logarithmic term in the expansion\nvanishes precisely when the cross section is a spherical space form, and we\nexpect that the vanishing of a further singular term will imply again\nsmoothness, but this is not yet clear beyond the case of cyclic space forms. In\nhigher dimensions the situation is naturally more difficult. We illustrate this\nin the case of cross sections with constant curvature. Then the logarithmic\nterm becomes a polynomial in the curvature with roots that are different from\n1, which necessitates more vanishing of other terms, not isolated so far.\n",

Recently, Britz et al presented a proof of a\nproduct formula \\[\n  \\det\\nolimits_m\\bigl( (I+A)\\cdot(I+B) \\bigr)\n  = \\det\\nolimits_m (I+A) \\cdot \\det\\nolimits_m (I+B) \\cdot\n\\exp\\operatorname{Tr}\\bigl({X_m(A,B)}\\bigr), \\] where $X_m(A,B)$ is an explicit\npolynomial in $A,B$ with values in the trace class operators. If $m=1$ then\n$X_1(A,B)=0$, hence the formula generalizes the classical determinant product\nformula.\n  One of the purposes of this note is to present two very simple alternative\nproofs of the formula. The first proof is a priori analytic and makes use of\nthe fact that $z\\mapsto \\det\\nolimits_m(I+zA)$ is holomorphic, while the second\nproof is completely algebraic. The algebraic proof has, in our opinion, some\ninteresting aspects in its own about the trace and commutators.\n  Secondly, we extend the above mentioned formula to several factors \\[\n  \\det\\nolimits_m\\Bigl( \\prod_{l=1}^r (I+A_l) \\Bigr)\n  =\\left( \\prod_{l=1}^r \\det\\nolimits_m (I+A_l) \\right)\n  \\cdot \\exp\\operatorname{Tr}\\bigl({X_{m,r}(A_r,\\ldots,A_r)}\\bigr). \\] The\nlatter is more than just a straightforward generalization as we will gain more\ninsights into the combinatorics behind it. Also we will present an algebraized\nversion of the analytic proof in the language of formal power series. The\nupshot is that the two identities are just combinatorial in nature.\n",

This allows us to\nmeasure the deviation from the leading term in the Weyl asymptotics for\neigenvalues on spheres and hemispheres. As a direct consequence, we obtain\nsimilar results for domains which tile hemispheres.

Apart from exceptional cases, the well-developed\nmethods used to examine the spectrum of selfadjoint problems are not\napplicable. One of the tools to attack non-selfadjoint problems are functional\nmodels. A drawback of many functional models is that their constructions\nrequire objects which may be difficult to describe explicitly, such as operator\nsquare roots, making it hard to apply the results to specific examples.\n  We develop a functional model for the case when the non-selfadjointness\narises both in additive terms and in the boundary conditions which is based on\nthe Lagrange identity. The flexibility of the choice of the $\\Gamma$-operators\nin the Lagrange identity means that these can be chosen so that expressions\narising in the model are given explicitly in terms of physical parameters\n(coefficients, boundary conditions and Titchmarsh-Weyl $M$-function) of the\nmaximally dissipative operator. The presentation of such explicit expressions\nfor the spectral form of the functional model is arguably the main contribution\nof the present paper. In the spectral form of the functional model, the\nselfadjoint dilation is very simple, being the operator of multiplication by an\nindependent variable in some auxiliary vector-valued function space.

In the second step this extension procedure generates\nmonogenic functions; the related monogenic functional calculus, based on the\nmonogenic spectrum, contains the Weyl functional calculus as a particular case.\nIn this paper we show that the extension operator from slice hyperholomorphic\nfunctions to monogenic functions admits various possible factorizations that\ninduce different function spaces.

Inspired by\nsuch monotonicity, we propose new spectrum-based graph invariants, called\n(variational) cut-off adjacency eigenvalues, that are relevant to certain\neigenvector-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Using these invariants, we\nobtain new lower bounds for the $p$-Laplacian variational eigenvalues,\nessentially giving the state-of-the-art spectral asymptotics for these\neigenvalues. Moreover, based on such invariants, we establish two inertia\nbounds regarding the cardinalities of a maximum independent set and a minimum\nedge cover, respectively. The first inertia bound enhances the classical\nCvetkovi\\'c bound, and the second one implies that the $k$-th $p$-Laplacian\nvariational eigenvalue is of the order $2^p$ as $p$ tends to infinity whenever\n$k$ is larger than the cardinality of a minimum edge cover of the underlying\ngraph. We further discover an interesting connection between graph\n$p$-Laplacian eigenvalues and tensor eigenvalues and discuss applications of\nour invariants to spectral problems of tensors.\n",

The model uses a time-fractional stochastic\nhyperbolic diffusion equation, which describes the evolution of spherical\nrandom fields on $\\bS^2$ in time. The diffusion operator incorporates a\ntime-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. In the first stage of the\nmodel, a homogeneous problem is considered, with an isotropic Gaussian random\nfield on $\\bS^2$ serving as the initial condition. In the second stage, the\nmodel transitions to an inhomogeneous problem driven by a time-delayed Brownian\nmotion on $\\bS^2$. The solution to the model is expressed through a series of\nreal spherical harmonics. To obtain an approximation, the expansion of the\nsolution is truncated at a certain degree $L\\geq1$. The analysis of truncation\nerrors reveals their convergence behavior, showing that convergence rates are\naffected by the decay of the angular power spectra of the driving noise and the\ninitial condition. In addition, we investigate the sample properties of the\nstochastic solution, demonstrating that, under some conditions, there exists a\nlocal H\\\"{o}lder continuous modification of the solution. To illustrate the\ntheoretical findings, numerical examples and simulations inspired by the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) are presented.\n",

The periodic potentials on each side of the\ninterface can, moreover, be different. As we show, eigenvalues can only occur\nin spectral gaps. We pose the eigenvalue problem as a $C^1$ gluing problem for\nthe fundamental solutions (Bloch functions) of the second order ODEs on each\nside of the interface. The problem is thus reduced to finding matchings of the\nratio functions $R_\\pm=\\frac{\\psi_\\pm'(0)}{\\psi_\\pm(0)}$, where $\\psi_\\pm$ are\nthose Bloch functions that decay on the respective half-lines. These ratio\nfunctions are analyzed with the help of the Pr\\\"{u}fer transformation. The\nlimit values of $R_\\pm$ at band edges depend on the ordering of Dirichlet and\nNeumann eigenvalues at gap edges. We show that the ordering can be determined\nin the first two gaps via variational analysis for potentials satisfying\ncertain monotonicity conditions. Numerical computations of interface\neigenvalues are presented to corroborate the analysis.\n",

We build up to results obtained by applying this generalised\ncollectively compact operator theory to the set of limit operators of an\noperator $A$. In the second half of this text we study bounded linear operators\non the generalised sequence space $\\ell^p(\\Z^N,U)$, where $p\\in [1,\\infty]$ and\n$U$ is some complex Banach space. We make what seems to be a more complete\nstudy than hitherto of the connections between Fredholmness, invertibility,\ninvertibility at infinity, and invertibility or injectivity of the set of limit\noperators, with some emphasis on the case when the operator $A$ is a locally\ncompact perturbation of the identity. Especially, we obtain stronger results\nthan previously known for the subtle limiting cases of $p=1$ and $\\infty$. Our\ntools in this study are the results from the first half of the text and an\nexploitation of the partial duality between $\\ell^1$ and $\\ell^\\infty$. Results\nin this second half of the text include a new proof that injectivity of all\nlimit operators (the classic Favard condition) implies invertibility for a\ngeneral class of almost periodic operators, and characterisations of\ninvertibility at infinity and Fredholmness for operators in the so-called\nWiener algebra. In two final chapters our results are illustrated by and\napplied to concrete examples. Firstly, we study the spectra and essential\nspectra of discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators (both self-adjoint and\nnon-self-adjoint), including operators with almost periodic and random\npotentials.

Main result of this paper asserts that the jump of\nthe singular spectral shift function at a resonance point is equal to the\nso-called resonance index, --- a new (to the best of my knowledge) notion\nintroduced in this paper.\n  Resonance index can be described as follows. For a fixed $\\lambda$ the\nresonance points $r_0$ of a path $H_r$ of self-adjoint operators are real poles\nof a certain meromorphic function associated with the triple $(\\lambda+i0;\nH_0,V).$ When $\\lambda+i0$ is shifted to $\\lambda+iy$ with small $y>0,$ that\npole get off the real axis in the coupling constant complex plane and, in\ngeneral, splits into some $N_+$ poles in the upper half-plane and some $N_-$\npoles in the lower half-plane (counting multiplicities). Resonance index of the\ntriple $(\\lambda; H_{r_0},V)$ is the difference $N_+-N_-.$\n  Based on the theorem just described, a non-trivial example of singular\nspectral shift function is given.\n",

Let M= U\\cup M_1, where M_1 is a compact\nmanifold with boundary and U represents a model of the singularity. For general\nelliptic operators we formulate a criterion, which can be checked solely on U,\nfor the existence of a global heat expansion, in particular for the existence\nof the analytic torsion in case of the Laplace operator. The main result then\nis the gluing formula for the analytic torsion. Here, decompositions\nM=M_1\\cup_W M_2 along any compact closed hypersurface W with M_1, M_2 both\nnon-compact are allowed; however product structure near W is assumed. We work\nwith the de Rham complex coupled to an arbitrary flat bundle F; the metric on F\nis not assumed to be flat. In an appendix the corresponding algebraic gluing\nformula is proved. As a consequence we obtain a framework for proving a\nCheeger-M\\\"uller type Theorem for singular manifolds; the latter has been the\nmain motivation for this work.\n  The main tool is Vishik's theory of moving boundary value problems for the de\nRham complex which has also been successfully applied to Dirac type operators\nand the eta invariant by J. Br\\\"uning and the author. The paper also serves as\na new, self--contained, and brief approach to Vishik's important work.\n",

        "summary": "  The isospectral reduction of matrix, which is closely related to its Schur\ncomplement, allows to reduce the size of a matrix while maintaining its\neigenvalues up to a known set. Here we generalize this procedure by increasing\nthe number of possible ways a matrix can be isospectrally reduced. The reduced\nmatrix has rational functions as entries. We show that the notion of\npseudospectrum can be extended to this class of matrices and that the\npseudospectrum of a matrix shrinks as the matrix is reduced. Hence the\neigenvalues of a reduced matrix are more robust to entry-wise perturbations\nthan the eigenvalues of the original matrix. We also introduce the notion of\ninverse pseudospectrum (or pseudoresonances), which indicates how stable the\npoles of a matrix with rational function entries are to certain matrix\nperturbations. A mass spring system is used to illustrate and give a physical\ninterpretation to both pseudospectra and inverse pseudospectra.\n",

We show that the there are\ntopological constraints on the index of the Laplacian matrix related to the\ndimension of a certain homology group. In certain situations, when the homology\ngroup is trivial, the index of the operator is rigid and is determined only by\nthe topology of the network and is independent of the strengths of the\ninteractions.

We\nshow that all the gaps of the spectrum allowed by the gap labeling theorem are\nopen for all values of the coupling constant. Also, we establish strict\ninequalities between the four spectral characteristics in question, and provide\nthe exact large coupling asymptotics of the dimension of the density of states\nmeasure (for the other three quantities, the large coupling asymptotics were\nknown before).\n  A crucial ingredient of the paper is the relation between spectral properties\nof the Fibonacci Hamiltonian and dynamical properties of the Fibonacci trace\nmap (such as dimensional characteristics of the non-wandering hyperbolic set\nand its measure of maximal entropy as well as other equilibrium measures,\ntopological entropy, multipliers of periodic orbits).

This is an extension of the\nscheme developed by Damanik and Goldstein for the special case $\\mathfrak{T} =\n\\mathbb{Z}^\\nu$. Our main motivation for working out this extension comes from\nan application to matrix functions which are dual to certain Hill operators.\nThese operators take the form $H_{\\tilde\\omega}=-\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\varepsilon\nU(\\tilde\\omega x)$, where $U$ is a real smooth function on the torus\n$\\mathbb{T}^\\nu$, $\\tilde\\omega\\in \\mathbb{R}^\\nu$ is a vector with rational\ncomponents, and $\\varepsilon$ is a small parameter. The group in this\nparticular case is the quotient $\\mathfrak{T} =\n\\mathbb{Z}^\\nu/\\{m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^\\nu:m\\tilde\\omega=0\\}$. We show that the\ngeneral theory indeed applies to this special case, provided that the rational\nfrequency vector $\\tilde\\omega$ obeys a suitable Diophantine condition in a\nlarge box of modes.

This enables us to derive a description of\nthe Floquet solutions and the band-gap structure of the spectrum, which we will\nuse in a companion paper to develop a complete inverse spectral theory for the\nSturm-Liouville equation with small quasi-periodic potential via periodic\napproximation of the frequency.

Such matrices are sometimes termed\nstochastic Toeplitz matrices $A_+$ in the semi-infinite case and stochastic\nLaurent matrices $A$ in the bi-infinite case. Their spectra, $\\Sigma=$ spec $A$\nand $\\Sigma_+=$ spec $A_+$, are independent of $A$ and $A_+$ as long as $A$ and\n$A_+$ are pseudoergodic (in the sense of E.B. Davies, Commun. Math. Phys.,\n2001), which holds almost surely in the random case. This was shown in Davies\n(2001) for $A$; that the same holds for $A_+$ is one main result of this paper.\nWe give upper and lower bounds on $\\Sigma$ and $\\Sigma_+$, and we explicitly\ncompute a set $G$ that fills the gap between the two in the sense that\n$\\Sigma\\cup G=\\Sigma_+$. We show that invertibility of one operator $A_+$\nimplies invertibility - and uniform boundedness of the inverses - of all finite\nsquare matrices with three diagonals in $U, V$ and $W$. This implies that the\nso-called finite section method for the approximate solution of a system\n$A_+x=b$ is applicable as soon as $A_+$ is invertible, and that the same method\nfor estimating the spectrum of $A_+$ does not suffer from spectral pollution.\nBoth results illustrate that tridiagonal stochastic Toeplitz operators share\nimportant properties of (classical) Toeplitz operators. One of our main tools\nis a new version of the Coburn lemma for classical Toeplitz operators, saying\nthat a stochastic tridiagonal Toeplitz operator, if Fredholm, is always\ninjective or surjective. In the final part we bound and compare the norms, and\nthe norms of inverses, of bi-infinite, semi-infinite and finite tridiagonal\nmatrices over $U$, $V$ and $W$. This allows the study of the resolvent norms,\nand hence the pseudospectra, of these operators and matrices.\n",

Examples include Euclidean space\nendowed with strongly log-concave and log-convex densities, extensions to\n$p$-exponential measures, unit-balls of $\\ell_p^n$, one-dimensional spaces and\nRiemannian submersions. Our main tool is a general Contraction Principle for\n\"eigenvalues\" on arbitrary metric-measure spaces.

We define a set of energy-preserving shift\noperators that satisfy many properties similar to their counterparts in\nclassical signal processing. Our definition of the graph shift operator negates\nthe shift operators defined in the literature, such as the graph adjacency\nmatrix and Laplacian matrix based shift operators, which modify the energy of a\ngraph signal. We decouple the graph structure represented by eigengraphs and\nthe eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix. We show that\nthe adjacency matrix of a graph is indeed a linear shift invariant (LSI) graph\nfilter with respect to the defined shift operator. We introduce graph finite\nimpulse response (GFIR) and graph infinite impulse response (GIIR) filters and\nobtain explicit forms for such filters. We further define autocorrelation and\ncross-correlation functions of signals on the graph, enabling us to obtain the\nsolution to the optimal filtering on graphs, i.e., the corresponding Wiener\nfiltering on graphs and the efficient spectra analysis and frequency domain\nfiltering in parallel with those in classical signal processing. This new shift\noperator based GSP framework enables the signal analysis along a correlation\nstructure defined by a graph shift manifold as opposed to classical signal\nprocessing operating on the assumption of the correlation structure with a\nlinear time shift manifold. We further provide the solution to the optimal\nlinear predictor problem over general graphs.

A set-pair version of the Lov\\'asz extension, which aims\nat the equivalence between discrete combination optimization and continuous\nfunction optimization, is established to recover the relationship\n$h^+=1-\\mu^+_1$. A local analysis of the associated functional yields an\ninverse power method to determine $h^+$ and then produces an efficient\nimplementation of the recursive spectral cut algorithm for the maxcut problem.\n",

It has been known for a long time that the quasi-classical\nasymptotics for traces of resulting operators strongly depend on the smoothness\nof the symbol: for smooth symbols the expansion is power-like, whereas\ndiscontinuous symbols (e.g. indicator functions) produce an extra logarithmic\nfactor. We investigate the transition regime by studying symbols depending on\nan extra parameter $T\\ge 0$ in such a way that the symbol tends to a\ndiscontinuous one as $T\\to 0$. The main result is two-parameter asymptotics (in\nthe quasi-classical parameter and in $T$), describing a transition from the\nsmooth case to the discontinuous one. The obtained asymptotic formulas are used\nto analyse the low-temperature scaling limit of the spatially bipartite\nentanglement entropy of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions.\n",

Moreover, we find that the Steklov\nspectrum also determines the lengths of the boundary components modulo an\nequivalence relation, and we show by examples that this result is the best\npossible. We construct various examples of Steklov isospectral Riemannian\norbifolds which demonstrate that these two-dimensional results do not extend to\nhigher dimensions.

These lower bounds can be considered as higher order Cheeger type\ninequalities for the Steklov eigenvalues. In particular it extends the Cheeger\ntype inequality for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue previously studied by\nEscobar in 1997 and by Jammes in 2015 to higher order Steklov eigenvalues. The\ntechnique we develop to get this lower bound is based on considering a family\nof accelerated Markov operators in the finite and mesurable situations and of\nmass concentration deformations of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the\nmanifold setting which converges uniformly to the Steklov operator. As an\nintermediary step in the proof of the higher order Cheeger type inequality, we\ndefine the Dirichlet-Steklov connectivity spectrum and show that the Dirichlet\nconnectivity spectra of this family of operators converges to (or bounded by)\nthe Dirichlet-Steklov spectrum uniformly. Moreover, we obtain bounds for the\nSteklov eigenvalues in terms of its Dirichlet-Steklov connectivity spectrum\nwhich is interesting in its own right and is more robust than the higher order\nCheeger type inequalities.

These eigenvalues obey furthermore a variational\nprinciple that allows us to define naturally a multidimensional power spectrum.\nThe eigenmodes, as far as they are concerned, exhibit a data-adaptive character\nmanifested in their phase which allows us in turn to define a multidimensional\nphase spectrum.\n  The resulting data-adaptive harmonic (DAH) modes allow for reducing the\ndata-driven modeling effort to elemental models stacked per frequency, only\ncoupled at different frequencies by the same noise realization. In particular,\nthe DAH decomposition extracts time-dependent coefficients stacked by Fourier\nfrequency which can be efficiently modeled---provided the decay of temporal\ncorrelations is sufficiently well-resolved---within a class of multilayer\nstochastic models (MSMs) tailored here on stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillators.\n  Applications to the Lorenz 96 model and to a stochastic heat equation driven\nby a space-time white noise, are considered.

In contrast to the operator essential\nnumerical range, the pencil essential numerical ranges are, in general, neither\nconvex nor even connected. The new concepts allow us to describe the set of\nspectral pollution when approximating the operator pencil by projection and\ntruncation methods. Moreover, by transforming the operator eigenvalue problem\n$Tx=\\lambda x$ into the pencil problem $BTx=\\lambda Bx$ for suitable choices of\n$B$, we can obtain non-convex spectral enclosures for $T$ and, in the study of\ntruncation and projection methods, confine spectral pollution to smaller sets\nthan with hitherto known concepts. We apply the results to various block\noperator matrices. In particular, Theorem 4.12 presents substantial\nimprovements over previously known results for Dirac operators while Theorem\n4.5 excludes spectral pollution for a class of non-selfadjoint Schr\\\"{o}dinger\noperators which it has not been possible to treat with existing methods.\n",

When suitably scaled, graph Laplacians\napproach limiting continuum operators in the large data limit. Studying these\nlimiting operators, therefore, sheds light on learning algorithms. This paper\nis devoted to the study of a parameterized family of divergence form elliptic\noperators that arise as the large data limit of graph Laplacians. The link\nbetween a three-parameter family of graph Laplacians and a three-parameter\nfamily of differential operators is explained. The spectral properties of these\ndifferential operators are analyzed in the situation where the data comprises\ntwo nearly separated clusters, in a sense which is made precise. In particular,\nwe investigate how the spectral gap depends on the three parameters entering\nthe graph Laplacian, and on a parameter measuring the size of the perturbation\nfrom the perfectly clustered case. Numerical results are presented which\nexemplify and extend the analysis: the computations study situations in which\nthere are two nearly separated clusters, but which violate the assumptions used\nin our theory; situations in which more than two clusters are present, also\ngoing beyond our theory; and situations which demonstrate the relevance of our\nstudies of differential operators for the understanding of finite data problems\nvia the graph Laplacian. The findings provide insight into parameter choices\nmade in learning algorithms which are based on weighted adjacency matrices;\nthey also provide the basis for analysis of the consistency of various\nunsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms, in the large data limit.\n",

One\ncharacterization, which is known for such operators is that $\\sigma_{\\text\ness}(H)$ is equal to the union over the spectra of right limits of $H$.\nAdditionally, the essential spectrum equals to the union over the sets of\n\"eigenvalues\" corresponding to bounded eigenfunctions of the right limits of\n$H$.

For almost periodic initial data with absolutely continuous\nspectrum, we prove that under Craig-type conditions on the spectrum, Dirichlet\ndata evolve according to a Lipschitz Dubrovin-type flow, so the solution is\nuniquely recovered by a trace formula.

Even in this 2D framework, very few results provide\nasymptotic expansion of WGM resonances at high polar frequency $m\\to\\infty$ for\ncavities with radially varying optical index.\n  In this work, using a direct Schr\\\"odinger analogy we highlight three typical\nbehaviors in such optical micro-disks, depending on the sign of an effective\ncurvature that takes into account the radius of the disk and the values of the\noptical index and its derivative. Accordingly, this corresponds to abruptly\nvarying effective potentials (step linear or step harmonic) or more classical\nharmonic potentials, leading to three distinct asymptotic expansions for ground\nstate energies.\n  Using multiscale expansions, we design a unified procedure to construct\nfamilies of quasi-resonances and associate quasi-modes that have the WGM\nstructure and satisfy eigenequations modulo a super-algebraically small\nresidual $O(m^{-\\infty})$.\n  We show using the black box scattering approach that quasi-resonances are\n$O(m^{-\\infty})$ close to true resonances.\n",

Among the many possible examples of non-local\noperators, we single out the fractional Laplacian and the massive relativistic\noperator, and we will derive and make extensive use of an additive relationship\nbetween the two.

A frame\ngraph $F_a$ is constructed contracting $a$ copies of $G$ along a subset of\nvertices $V_0$. In a second step, for any partition $A=(a_1,\\dots,a_s)$ of\nlength $s$ of a natural number $r$ (i.e., $r=a_1+\\dots+a_s$) we construct a new\ngraph $F_A$ contracting now the frames $F_{a_1},\\dots,F_{a_s}$ selected by $A$\nalong a proper subset of vertices $V_1\\subset V_0$. All the graphs obtained by\ndifferent $s$-partitions of $r\\geq 4$ (for any choice of $V_0$ and $V_1$) are\nisospectral and non-isomorphic.\n  In particular, we obtain increasing finite families of graphs which are\nisospectral for given $r$ and $s$ for different types of magnetic Laplacians\nincluding the standard Laplacian, the signless standard Laplacian, certain\nkinds of signed Laplacians and, also, for the (unbounded) Kirchhoff Laplacian\nof the underlying equilateral metric graph. The spectrum of the isospectral\ngraphs is determined by the spectrum of the Laplacian of the building block $G$\nand the spectrum for the Laplacian with Dirichlet conditions on the set of\nvertices $V_0$ and $V_1$ with multiplicities determined by the numbers $r$ and\n$s$ of the partition.\n",

The\nThouless formula relates the conductance of the sample to the width of the\nspectral bands of the infinite crystal obtained by periodic juxtaposition of S.\nIn this spirit, we define Landauer-B\\\"uttiker crystalline currents by extending\nthe Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formula to a setup where the sample S is replaced by a\nperiodic structure whose unit cell is S. We argue that these crystalline\ncurrents are closely related to the Thouless currents.

Our construction does not depend on\nnumerical methods. Instead, they are obtained by solving small linear systems\nwith integer coefficients derived from the Jucys-Murphy operators. Then both\nthe construction and the succesive application of all these $n-1$ matrices can\nbe performed using $O(n \\binom{n}{k})$ operations.\n  As a consequence, we show that the problem of computing all the weights of\nthe isotypic components of a given function can be solved in $O(n\n\\binom{n}{k})$ operations, improving the previous bound $O(k^2 \\binom{n}{k})$\nwhen $k$ asymptotically dominates $\\sqrt{n}$.\n",

The domains are\nobtained by removing small geodesic balls that are asymptotically densely\nuniformly distributed as their radius tends to zero. We use this relationship\nto construct manifolds that have large Steklov eigenvalues.\n  In dimension two, and with constant weight equal to 1, we prove that\nKokarev's upper bound of $8\\pi$ for the first nonzero normalised Steklov\neigenvalue on orientable surfaces of genus 0 is saturated. For other\ntopological types and eigenvalue indices, we also obtain lower bounds on the\nbest upper bound for the eigenvalue in terms of Laplace maximisers. For the\nfirst two eigenvalues, these lower bounds become equalities. A surprising\nconsequence is the existence of free boundary minimal surfaces immersed in the\nunit ball by first Steklov eigenfunctions and with area strictly larger than\n$2\\pi$. This was previously thought to be impossible. We provide numerical\nevidence that some of the already known examples of free boundary minimal\nsurfaces have these properties and also exhibit simulations of new free\nboundary minimal surfaces of genus 0 in the unit ball with even larger area.\nThe first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of all these examples is equal to 1, as a\nconsequence of their symmetries and topology, so that they verify a general\nconjecture by Fraser and Li.\n  In dimension three and larger, we prove that the isoperimetric inequality of\nColbois--El Soufi--Girouard is sharp and implies an upper bound for weighted\nLaplace eigenvalues. We also show that in any manifold with a fixed metric, one\ncan construct by varying the weight a domain with connected boundary whose\nfirst nonzero normalised Steklov eigenvalue is arbitrarily large.\n",

Our definition is based on a class of self-similar Laplacians\ninstead of the standard discrete Laplacian, and includes the classical almost\nMathieu operators as a particular case. Our main result establishes that the\nspectra of these self-similar almost Mathieu operators can be completely\ndescribed by the spectra of the corresponding self-similar Laplacians through\nthe spectral decimation framework used in the context of spectral analysis on\nfractals. In addition, the self-similar structure of our model provides a\nnatural finite graph approximation model. This approximation is not only\nhelpful in executing the numerical simulation, but is also useful in finding\nthe spectral decimation function via Schur complement computations of given\nfinite-dimensional matrices. The self-similar Laplacians used in our model were\nconsidered recently by Chen and Teplyaev who proved the emergence of singularly\ncontinuous spectra for specific parameters. We use this result to arrive at\nsimilar conclusions in the context of the self-similar almost Mathieu\noperators. Finally, we derive an explicit formula of the integrated density of\nstates of the self-similar almost Mathieu operators as the weighted pre-images\nof the balanced invariant measure on a specific Julia set.\n",

Specifically, the Fourier transform of $u$ is $f\\,d\\sigma$, where\n$d\\sigma$ is the Hausdorff measure on the unit circle and the density $f$ is a\nfunction on the circle that, roughly speaking, has exactly $s-\\frac12$\nderivatives in $L^2$ almost surely. When $s=0$, one recovers the classical\nsetting for random waves with a translation-invariant covariance-kernel. The\nmain thrust of this paper is to explore the connection between the regularity\nparameter $s$ and the asymptotic behavior of the number $N(\\nabla u,R)$ of\ncritical points that are contained in the disk of radius $R\\gg1$. More\nprecisely, we show that the expectation $\\mathbb{E}N(\\nabla u,R)$ grows like\nthe area of the disk when the regularity is low enough ($s<\\frac32$) and like\nthe diameter when the regularity is high enough ($s>\\frac52$), and that the\ncorresponding exponent changes according to a linear interpolation law in the\nintermediate regime. The transitions occurring at the endpoint cases involve\nthe square root of the logarithm of the radius. Interestingly, the highest\nasymptotic growth rate occurs only in the classical translation-invariant\nsetting, $s=0$. A key step of the proof of this result is the obtention of\nprecise asymptotic expansions for certain Neumann series of Bessel functions.\nWhen the regularity parameter is $s>5$, we show that in fact $N(\\nabla u,R)$\ngrows like the diameter with probability 1, albeit the ratio is not a universal\nconstant but a random variable.\n",

In case of rank one (and positive) perturbation $V,$ there\nis only one coupling resonance function, which is a Herglotz function. This\ncase has been studied in depth in the literature, and appears in different\nsituations, such as Sturm-Liouville theory, random Schr\\\"odinger operators,\nharnomic and spectral analyses, etc. The general case is complicated by the\nfact that the resonance functions are no longer single valued holomorphic\nfunctions, and potentially can have quite an erratic behaviour, typical for\ninfinitely-valued holomorphic functions. Of special interest are those coupling\nresonance functions $r_z$ which approach a real number $r_{\\lambda+i0}$ from\nthe interval $[0,1]$ as the spectral parameter $z=\\lambda+iy$ approaches a\npoint $\\lambda$ of the essential spectrum, since they are responsible for\nspectral flow through $\\lambda$ inside essential spectrum when $H_0$ gets\ndeformed to $H_1 = H_0+V$ via the path $H_0 + rV, r \\in [0,1].$\n  In this paper it is shown that if the pair $H_0,$ $V$ satisfies the limiting\nabsorption principle, then the coupling resonance functions are well-behaved\nnear the essential spectrum in the following sense. Let $I$ be an open interval\ninside the essential spectrum of $H_0$ and $\\epsilon>0.$ Then there exists a\ncompact subset~$K$ of~$I$ such that $| I \\setminus K | < \\epsilon,$ and $K$ has\na \"non-tangential\" neighbourhood in the upper complex half-plane, such that any\ncoupling resonance function is either single-valued in the neighbourhood, or\ndoes not take a real value in the interval $[0,1].$\n",

We also discuss the stability of purely singular\ncontinuous spectrum, which, given the zero-measure spectrum result, amounts to\nstability results for eigenvalue exclusion. In particular, we examine\nsituations in which the existing criteria for the exclusion of eigenvalues are\nstable under periodic perturbations. As a highlight of this, we show that any\nsimple Toeplitz subshift over a binary alphabet exhibits uniform absence of\neigenvalues on the hull for any periodic perturbation whose period is\ncommensurate with the coding sequence. In the case of a full shift, we give an\neffective criterion to compute exactly the spectrum of a random Anderson model\nperturbed by a potential of period two, and we further show that the naive\ngeneralization of this criterion does not hold for period three. Next, we\nconsider quasi-periodic potentials with potentials generated by trigonometric\npolynomials with periodic background. We show that the quasiperiodic cocycle\ninduced by passing to blocks of period length is subcritical when the coupling\nconstant is small and supercritical when the coupling constant is large. Thus,\nthe spectral type is absolutely continuous for small coupling and pure point\n(for a.e.\\ frequency and phase) when the coupling is large.\n",

        "summary": "  The propagation of internal gravity waves in stratified media, such as those\nfound in ocean basins and lakes, leads to the development of geometrical\npatterns called \"attractors\". These structures accumulate much of the wave\nenergy and make the fluid flow highly singular. In more analytical terms, the\ncause of this phenomenon has been attributed to the presence of a continuous\nspectrum in some nonlocal zeroth-order pseudo-differential operators. In this\nwork, we analyze the generation of these attractors from a numerical analysis\nperspective. First, we propose a high-order pseudo-spectral method to solve the\nevolution problem (whose long-term behaviour is known to be not\nsquare-integrable). Then, we use similar tools to discretize the corresponding\neigenvalue problem. Since the eigenvalues are embedded in a continuous\nspectrum, we compute them using viscous approximations. Finally, we explore the\neffect that the embedded eigenmodes have on the long-term evolution of the\nsystem.\n",

For scalar bistable reaction-diffusions PDEs, the bistable case even\nhas take on different names within communities such as Allee, Allen-Cahn,\nChafee-Infante, Nagumo, Ginzburg-Landau, $\\Phi_4$, Schl\\\"ogl, Stommel, just to\nname a few structurally similar bistable model names. One key mechanism, how\nbistability arises under parameter variation is a pitchfork bifurcation. In\nparticular, taking the pitchfork bifurcation normal form for reaction-diffusion\nPDEs is yet another variant within the family of PDEs mentioned above. More\ngenerally, the study of this PDE class considering steady states and stability,\nrelated to bifurcations due to a parameter is well-understood for the\ndeterministic case. For the stochastic PDE (SPDE) case, the situation is less\nwell-understood and has been studied recently. In this paper we generalize and\nunify several recent results for SPDE bifurcations. Our generalisation is\nmotivated directly by applications as we introduce in the equation a spatially\nheterogeneous term and relax the assumptions on the covariance operator that\ndefines the noise. For this spatially heterogeneous SPDE, we prove a\nfinite-time Lyapunov exponent bifurcation result. Furthermore, we extend the\ntheory of early warning signs in our context and we explain, the role of\nuniversal exponents between covariance operator warning signs and the lack of\nfinite-time Lyapunov uniformity.

These graphs are shown to\nexhibit rather intriguing behaviour: for example, we construct a periodic graph\nwhose Laplacian has purely singular continuous spectrum. Regarding point\nspectrum, and different to the locally finite case, we construct a graph with a\npartly flat band whose eigenvectors must have infinite support. Concerning\ndynamical aspects, under some assumptions we prove that motion remains\nballistic along at least one layer. We also construct a graph whose Laplacian\nhas purely absolutely continuous spectrum, exhibits ballistic transport, yet\nfails to satisfy a dispersive estimate. This provides a negative answer to an\nopen question in this context. Furthermore, we include a discussion of the\nfractional Laplacian for which we prove a phase transition in its dynamical\nbehaviour. Generally speaking, many questions still remain open, and we believe\nthat the studied class of graphs can serve as a playground to better understand\nexotic spectra and dynamics.\n",

The eta invariant on a\nfundamental domain is computed to be irrational. The spectral counting function\nis calculated and the accumulated degeneracy give exactly. A generalised\nWeyl-Polya conjecture for p-forms is suggested and verified.\n",

One might expect these two concepts to be related, but\nunfortunately examples demonstrate that there is no way in general to deduce\nthe Krein signature of an eigenvalue from the Evans function.\n  The purpose of this paper is to recall and popularize a simple graphical\ninterpretation of the Krein signature well-known in the spectral theory of\npolynomial operator pencils. This interpretation avoids altogether the need to\nview the Krein signature in terms of root subspaces and their relation to\nindefinite quadratic forms. To demonstrate the utility of this graphical\ninterpretation of the Krein signature, we use it to define a simple\ngeneralization of the Evans function -- the Evans-Krein function -- that allows\nthe calculation of Krein signatures in a way that is easy to incorporate into\nexisting Evans function evaluation codes at virtually no additional\ncomputational cost. The graphical Krein signature also enables us to give\nelegant proofs of index theorems for linearized Hamiltonians in the finite\ndimensional setting: a general result implying as a corollary the generalized\nVakhitov-Kolokolov criterion (or Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss criterion) and a\ncount of real eigenvalues for linearized Hamiltonian systems in canonical form.\nThese applications demonstrate how the simple graphical nature of the Krein\nsignature may be easily exploited.\n",

We offer a dynamical perspective on the motion\nand interaction of the eigenvalues in the complex plane, derive their governing\nequations and discuss applications. C.c. pairs closest to the real axis, or\nthose that are ill-conditioned, attract most strongly and can collide to become\nexactly real. As an application we consider random perturbations of a fixed\nmatrix $M$. If $M$ is Normal, the total expected force on any eigenvalue is\nshown to be only the attraction of its c.c. (Eq. 24) and when $M$ is circulant\nthe strength of interaction can be related to the power spectrum of white\nnoise. We extend this by calculating the expected force (Eq. 41) for real\nstochastic processes with zero-mean and independent intervals. To quantify the\ndominance of the c.c. attraction, we calculate the variance of other forces. We\napply the results to the Hatano-Nelson model and provide other numerical\nillustrations. It is our hope that the simple dynamical perspective herein\nmight help better understanding of the aggregation and low density of the\neigenvalues of real random matrices on and near the real line respectively.

These conditions include purely Lorentz scalar\nand purely non-critical anomalous magnetic interactions as well as the\nconfinement case, the latter having an important application in the\nmathematical description of graphene. Using a certain ordinary boundary triple,\nwe show the self-adjointness of $A_{\\eta, \\tau, \\lambda}$ for arbitrary\ncombinations of the interaction strengths (including critical ones) under the\ncondition that $\\Sigma$ is $C^{\\infty}$-smooth and derive its spectral\nproperties. In particular, in the critical case, a loss of Sobolev regularity\nin the operator domain and a possible additional point of the essential\nspectrum are observed.\n",

A new method for analysing non-linear\neigenvector-like centrality measures of non-uniform hypergraphs is presented in\nthis paper that could be useful for studying properties of\n$\\mathcal{H}$-eigenvectors and $\\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors in the non-uniform\ncase.

Our motivation comes from the study\nof almost-periodic operators, particularly those that arise as models of\nquasicrystals. Such operators are known for intricate hierarchical patterns and\noften display delicate spectral properties, such as Cantor spectra, which are\nsignificant in studying quantum mechanical systems and materials science. We\npropose a series of algorithms that compute these properties under different\nassumptions and explore their theoretical implications through the Solvability\nComplexity Index (SCI) hierarchy. This approach provides a rigorous framework\nfor understanding the computational feasibility of these problems, proving\nalgorithmic optimality, and enhancing the precision of spectral analysis in\npractical settings. For example, we show that our methods are optimal by\nproving certain lower bounds (impossibility results) for the class of\nlimit-periodic Schr\\\"odinger operators. We demonstrate our methods through\nstate-of-the-art computations for aperiodic systems in one and two dimensions,\neffectively capturing these complex spectral characteristics. The results\ncontribute significantly to connecting theoretical and computational aspects of\nspectral theory, offering insights that bridge the gap between abstract\nmathematical concepts and their practical applications in physical sciences and\nengineering. Based on our work, we conclude with conjectures and open problems\nregarding the spectral properties of specific models.\n",

In this ad hoc limit, local energy averages of the\nvariance converge to an expression corresponding to the variance of the same\nstatistic when considering instead spectra of large random matrices of the\nGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). By twisting the Laplacian with unitary\nrepresentations, we are able to observe different statistics, corresponding to\nthe Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) when time reversal symmetry is broken.\nThese results were shown by F.

Similarly, spectral\ndecompositions (pure point, absolutely continuous and singular continuous)\noften characterise relevant physical properties such as long-time dynamics of\nquantum systems. Despite new results on computing spectra, there remains no\ngeneral method able to compute spectral measures or spectral decompositions of\ninfinite-dimensional normal operators. Previous efforts focus on specific\nexamples where analytical formulae are available (or perturbations thereof) or\non classes of operators with a lot of structure. Hence the general\ncomputational problem is predominantly open. We solve this problem by providing\nthe first set of general algorithms that compute spectral measures and\ndecompositions of a wide class of operators. Given a matrix representation of a\nself-adjoint or unitary operator, such that each column decays at infinity at a\nknown asymptotic rate, we show how to compute spectral measures and\ndecompositions. We discuss how these methods allow the computation of objects\nsuch as the functional calculus, and how they generalise to a large class of\npartial differential operators, allowing, for example, solutions to evolution\nPDEs such as Schr\\\"odinger equations on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$. Computational\nspectral problems in infinite dimensions have led to the SCI hierarchy, which\nclassifies the difficulty of computational problems. We classify computation of\nmeasures, measure decompositions, types of spectra, functional calculus, and\nRadon--Nikodym derivatives in the SCI hierarchy. The new algorithms are\ndemonstrated to be efficient on examples taken from OPs on the real line and\nthe unit circle (e.g. giving computational realisations of Favard's theorem and\nVerblunsky's theorem), and are applied to evolution equations on a 2D\nquasicrystal.\n",

Our approach employs linear programming techniques to derive\nrigorous bounds by leveraging two types of spectral identities. The first type,\ninspired by the conformal bootstrap, arises from the consistency of the\nspectral decomposition of the product of Laplace eigensections, and involves\nthe Laplacian spectra as well as integrals of triple products of eigensections.\nWe formulate these conditions in the language of representation theory of\n$\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$ and use them to prove upper bounds on the first\nand second Laplacian eigenvalues. The second type of spectral identities\nfollows from the Selberg trace formula. We use them to find upper bounds on the\nspectral gap of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on hyperbolic 3-orbifolds, as\nwell as on the systole length of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, as a function of the\nvolume. Further, we prove that the spectral gap $\\lambda_1$ of the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator on all closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds satisfies\n$\\lambda_1 < 47.32$. Along the way, we use the trace formula to estimate the\nlow-energy spectra of a large set of example orbifolds and compare them with\nour general bounds, finding that the bounds are nearly sharp in several cases.\n",

Applying semidefinite programming methods to our identities\nproduces rigorous upper bounds on the Laplacian spectral gap as well as on the\nDirac spectral gap conditioned on the former. In several examples, our bounds\nare nearly sharp; a numerical algorithm based on the Selberg trace formula\nshows that the $[0;3,3,5]$ orbifold, a particular surface with signature\n$[1;3]$, and the Bolza surface nearly saturate the bounds at genus $0$, $1$ and\n$2$ respectively. Under additional assumptions on the number of harmonic\nspinors carried by the spin-surface, we obtain more restrictive bounds on the\nLaplacian spectral gap. In particular, these bounds apply to hyperelliptic\nsurfaces. We also determine the set of Laplacian spectral gaps attained by all\ncompact orientable two-dimensional hyperbolic spin orbifolds.

In other words, the Poisson relation, which asserts that the singular\nsupport of the wave trace is contained in the closure of $\\pm$ the length\nspectrum, can almost be made into a strict inclusion. To do so, we construct\nlarge families of domains for which there exist multiple periodic billiard\norbits having the same length but different Maslov indices. Using the\nmicrolocal Balian-Bloch-Zelditch parametrix for wave invariants developed in\nour previous paper, we solve a large system of equations for the boundary\ncurvature jets, which leads to the required cancellations. We call such\nperiodic orbits silent, since they are undetectable from the ostensibly audible\nwave trace. Such cancellations show that there are potential limitations in\nusing the wave trace for inverse spectral problems and more fundamentally, that\nthe Laplace spectrum and length spectrum are inherently different mathematical\nobjects, at least insofar as the wave trace is concerned.\n",

Most of the classical results in this area are\noptimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the\nground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For\ninstance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank,\nand the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of\nperturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea is to\nexploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and\nthe noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour\nintegration method with combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery,\nwhich has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild\nassumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different\nareas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low\nrank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area.\nNext, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the\nspiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different\ndirections of current research. Finally, and somewhat unexpectedly, we can use\nour results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning\neigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices.
