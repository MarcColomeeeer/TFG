A central message from the\ntheory of integrating stochastic differential equations is that there exists in\ngeneral two time scales, i.e. that of integrating these equations and that of\nsampling. We argue that therefore maximum likelihood estimation is\ncomputational extremely expensive. We discuss the relation between maximum\nlikelihood and quasi maximum likelihood estimation. In a simulation study, we\ncompare the quasi maximum likelihood method with an approach for parameter\nestimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations that disregards the\nexistence of the two time scales.\n",

Of great interest for\nreal social and biological systems are cases in which the payoffs to members of\nthe minority group depend on the size of the minority group. This latter\nincludes the fixed sum game. We find, remarkably, that the phase structure and\ngeneral scaling behavior of the standard minority game persists when the payoff\nfunction depends on the size of the minority group. there is still a phase\ntransition at the same value of z, the ratio of the dimension of the strategy\nspace to the number of agents playing the game. We explain the persistence of\nthe phase structure and argue that it is due to the absence of temporal\ncooperation in the dynamics of the minority game. We also discuss the behavior\nof average agent wealth and the wealth distribution in these variable payoff\ngames.\n",

Then, the probability density function (pdf) of the total error is\napproximated by the convolution integral of the Gaussian and the Laplacian pdf.\nTo explore the hypothesis of a nonlinear component of the analytical error I\nhave evaluated this distribution and calculated various quality control related\nstatistics with numerical methods. Large errors are much more probable with the\nproposed distribution than with the Gaussian. Simulated series of measurements\nwith the proposed distribution often meet the criteria for normality. The\ncritical errors and the probabilities for critical error detection are less\nthan the respective ones of the Gaussian distribution. The probabilities for\nfalse rejection are greater.

This can also be made\nby humans or by artificial systems, but there is no \"knowledge\" involved in the\nprocess. We ranked the words occurring in an edited electronic publication\nspecialized in complex systems research, and we found that they approximate a\nmodified Zipf distribution. We compared occurrences of representative words\nfrom the distribution with the occurrences in non-discriminative media. We\nfound that a non-discriminative medium (Google) has a higher variance from of\nour original distribution than a semi-discriminative one (NEC Research Index),\neven when both appear to have their own modified Zipf distribution. We conclude\nthat discriminative media have a higher efficiency rating, at least in the area\nin which they specialize, than non-discriminative media. Using the same search\nmethod, the discriminative media should deliver more relevant information. This\nrelevancy also depends on the skills of the user, but non-discriminative media\nare more sensitive to poor searching skills, as there is a higher probability\nof delivering irrelevant information.

I show that the largest of the extinction events in this\nmodel are caused by one of three mechanisms, each of which produces a specific\ndiscontinuous change in the graph's topology. The model is analytically\ntractable: two theorems are proved which determine the set of nodes with least\nrelative population in the attractor, for any given graph. This in turn can be\nused to analytically demonstrate the inevitability of the formation and growth\nof ACSs and calculate the associated timescales. Finally, I show that the\nformation and growth of ACSs is robust to the relaxation of many of the\nidealizations made to enhance the analytical tractability of the model.\n",

The\ngame is symmetric, and each player tries to obtain an advantageous deal, but\nwhen one of them pushes too hard, no deal at all can be concluded, and they\nboth loose. The game has many equilibria, and which of them is reached depends\non the history of the interactions as the players evolve according to a fitness\nfunction that measures their gains across the interactions. We can then break\nthe symmetry by assigning different strategy spaces to the populations, varying\nin particular with respect to the information available to the agents. The\nagents can, for example, adapt to the behavior of their opponents met in\nprevious rounds, or they can try to copy the strategies of their successful\nfriends. It turns out that, in general, the more restricted strategy spaces,\nthat is, those that utilize less information, are more advantageous for a\npopulation as a whole as their adoption drives the equilibrium in a direction\nadvantageous to that population. One reason is that a simpler strategy can be\nlearned faster in an evolutionary setting, another is that it is good for a\npopulation to have some individuals that are unfit in the sense that they make\noffers that are individually unsuccessful, but have a systematic effect on the\nstrategies of their opponents. All these effects are demonstrated through\nsystematic simulations.\n",

The origin of class endogamy, and of\nsocial stratification in general, is a major open question in archaeology. This\npaper implements a verbal model proposed by Marcus and Flannery as a class of\nagent-based computer models by generalizing and simplifying a mathematical\nmodel of marriage markets developed by Burdett and Coles. One force that can\nproduce class endogamy occurs if agents are only willing to marry suitors\nhaving status no less than some fixed value below the status of their\nhighest-status suitor, which they can learn. Another such force results if\nchildren inherit the average of their parents' statuses. In contrast, status\nachieved over an agent's lifetime can be viewed as noise, analogous to mutation\nin biological evolution. I propose that class endogamy may have resulted from\nthe interaction of forces such as these, along with other factors such as\nideology. Simulation results are presented, and potential areas for future\nresearch are sketched out. The validity of these models for any particular\nculture depends, of course, on whether these forces were actually operating in\nthat society.\n",

They are based on a continuous approximation of\npopulation dynamics. Four dynamical elements are required in this formulation:\nascendant matrix, transverse matrix, fitness function, and the stochastic\ndrive. The first law states that in the absence of stochastic drive the\nartificial life always seeks for a local fitness attractor and stay there. It\ngives the reference point to discuss the general evolutionary dynamics. The\nsecond law is explicitly expressed in a unique form of stochastic differential\nequation with all four dynamical elements. The third law defines the\nrelationship between the focused level of description to its lower and higher\nones, and also defines the dichotomy of deterministic and stochastic drives.\nThese laws provide a coherence framework to discuss several current problems,\nsuch as emergency and stability. In particular, two quantities are emphasized:\nthe fitness function as the standard for selection and the stochasticity as the\nsource of creativity. Those three laws may appear almost self-evident from a\nstatistical physics point of view. However, their equivalent to a most\nconventional approach for evolutionary dynamics is shown for the first time by\nthe present author, to the best of his knowledge. The computational advantage\nof the present formulation in the study of artificial life evolution is also\ndiscussed.\n",

Here we examine how the introduction of small-world topological\nstructure into networks affect their stability. Our results indicate that, in\nstructured networks, the parameter values at which the stability-instability\ntransition occurs with increasing complexity is identical to that predicted by\nthe May-Wigner criteria. However, the nature of the transition, as measured by\nthe finite-size scaling exponent, appears to change as the network topology\ntransforms from regular to random, with the small-world regime as the\ncross-over region.

Attempts to take advantage of this paradigm\nand mimic the behavior of insect swarms however often lead to many different\nimplementations of SI. The rather vague notions of what constitutes\nself-organized behavior lead to rather ad hoc approaches that make it difficult\nto ascertain just what SI is, assess its true potential and more fully take\nadvantage of it. This article provides a set of general principles for SI\nresearch and development. A precise definition of self-organized behavior is\ndescribed and provides the basis for a more axiomatic and logical approach to\nresearch and development as opposed to the more prevalent ad hoc approach in\nusing SI concepts. The concept of Pareto optimality is utilized to capture the\nnotions of efficiency and adaptability. A new concept, Scale Invariant Pareto\nOptimality is described and entails symmetry relationships and scale invariance\nwhere Pareto optimality is preserved under changes in system states. This\nprovides a mathematical way to describe efficient tradeoffs of efficiency\nbetween different scales and further, mathematically captures the notion of the\ngraceful degradation of performance so often sought in complex systems.\n",

This paper examines two of the\nfactors that have some bearing on this issue, using the Tierra artificial life\nsystem.\n  {\\em Parsimony pressure} is a tendency to penalise more complex organisms by\nthe extra cost needed to reproduce longer genotypes, encouraging simplification\nto happen. In Tierra, parsimony is controlled by the \\verb+SlicePow+ parameter.\nWhen full parsimony is selected, evolution optimises the ancestral organism to\nproduce extremely simple organisms. With parsimony completely relaxed,\norganisms grow larger, but not more complex. They fill up with ``junk''. This\npaper looks at scanning a range of \\verb+SlicePow+ from 0.9 to 1 to see if\nthere is an optimal value for generating complexity.\n  Tierra (along with most ALife systems) use pseudo random number generators.\nAlgorithms can never create information, only destroy it. So the total\ncomplexity of the Tierra system is bounded by the initial complexity, implying\nthat the individual organism complexity is bounded. Biological systems,\nhowever, have plenty of sources of randomness, ultimately dependent on quantum\nrandomness, so do not have this complexity limit. Sources of real random\nnumbers exist for computers called {\\em entropy gatherers} -- this paper\nreports on the effect of changing Tierra's pseudo random number generator for\nan entropy gatherer.\n",

A critical point is the attractor of the international system.\nThe war dynamics of Great Powers can be illustrated by a power law. As a result\nof a driving force, the international system is constantly being pushed toward\nthis critical point. The security dilemma is a booster of this driving force.\nTension and frustration build up in the international system as a result of\nvarious system thresholds, and are periodically discharged through wars. The\nSOC characteristics of the international system result in a punctuated\nequilibrium dynamic. The punctuations produce new international systems, each\nwith its specific characteristics. A quantifiable development of the\ninternational system toward a condition of increased stability and reduced\nresilience can be observed. In addition to SOC characteristics, the\ninternational system exhibits characteristics of a chaotic system. Chaos, order\nand development are closely linked. The SOC dynamics generate a process of\nsocial expansion. It is possible to explain the social integration of Europe\nfrom this perspective.\n",

We found that the frequency sweep can\ncause controlled transitions between two stable states of the system.

We propose a simple\nexplanation for this phenomenon and find the transient life-time to scale as\n$-(\\ln{|r-r_c|})/\\lambda_r$ where $r_c$ is the critical rate necessary to\ninduce a transition and $\\lambda_r$ is the repulsive eigenvalue of the saddle.\nExperimental implications are mentioned.\n",

For this, we develop a discrete, spatially\nextended model based in a multi--agent approach. In our model, the mobility of\nsocioeconomic agents is driven only by the housing prices. Agents exchange\nlocation in order to fit their status to the cost of their housing. On the\nother hand, the price of a particular house changes depends on the status of\nits tenant, and on the neighborhood mean lodging cost, weighted by a control\nparameter. The agent's dynamics converges to a spatially organized\nconfiguration, whose regularity we measured by using an entropy--like\nindicator. With this simple model we found a nontrivial dependence of\nsegregation on both, the initial inequality of the socioeconomic agents and the\ninflationary parameter. In this way we supply an explanatory model for the\nsegregation--inequality thesis putted forward by Douglas Massey.\n",

In another work, we classified all self-similar\nsolutions and all universality classes (domains of attraction) for scaling\nlimits under weak convergence (Comm. Pure Appl. Math 57 (2004)1197-1232). Here\nwe add to this a complete description of the set of all limit points of\nsolutions modulo scaling (the scaling attractor) and the dynamics on this limit\nset (the ultimate dynamics). The main tool is Bertoin's L\\'{e}vy-Khintchine\nrepresentation formula for eternal solutions of Smoluchowski's equation (Adv.\nAppl. Prob. 12 (2002) 547--64). This representation linearizes the dynamics on\nthe scaling attractor, revealing these dynamics to be conjugate to a continuous\ndilation, and chaotic in a classical sense.

The work shows\nthat complex adaptive models may give rise to \"turbulent\" dynamics, which\nemerge once the battlefield is no longer \"linear\", i.e. once military\nformations no longer form ordered lines or columns. This is done using a\ncellular automaton model. This model exhibits a high degree of complexity,\nleading to a rich variety of behaviour. Conventional statistical methods fail\nto adequately capture this richness. Particular attention is paid to the\nproperties of the attrition function. It is found that this function is\ndiscontinuous and possesses non-linear properties such as clustering of\ncasualties, scaling of the statistical moments of the data and fat-tailed\nprobability distributions. Fractal methods are found to be capable of\nquantifying these properties. A particularly significant result is the\nnon-linearity of the pay-off of improved weapons performance. This contrasts\nwith conventional models, where the attrition rate usually depends in a linear\nway on kill probability. Additionally, the model is found to possess at least\ntwo attractive states. A transition exists between the two cases in some\nsituations. This transition appears to behave in an analogous way to the\ntransition between laminar and turbulent states in fluid dynamics.\n",

Our current work seeks to identify and\nclarify such key issues as we represent and analyze in simulation a full\nimplementation of a minimal protocell. Using a 3D dissipative particle dynamics\n(DPD) simulation method we are able to address the coupled diffusion,\nself-assembly, and chemical reaction processes, required to model a full life\ncycle of the protocell, the protocell being composed of coupled genetic,\nmetabolic, and container subsystems.

This failure might be emergent\nnot only when the synchronized orbit is selected to be some sort of equilibrium\nor some sort of periodic oscillation, but also when it is taken as some type of\nchaotic attractor produced by driving system. This result implies that chaotic\nproperty of driving signal is not necessary to achievement of parameter\nidentification. The mechanism inducing such a failure, as well as the bounded\nproperty of all trajectories generated by coupled systems, is theoretically\nexpatiated. New synchronization techniques are proposed to rigorously realize\nthe complete synchronization and parameter identification in a class of systems\nwhere the nonlinearity is not globally Lipschitz. In addition, parameter\nidentification are discussed for systems with time delay.\n",

By interpolating the properties of the edges that constitute\nnetwork into the two leading parameters of the nodes, this method can abstract\nthe configuration of real-life transportation networks without losing the\ninfluence of the distance and the capability of the physical facilities, which\nare essential parts of the transportation networks. With this method we can\nstudy network transportation from the local point of view and describe network\ncongestion in detail, especially the dispersing of congestion. After applying\nthis method, as an example, to the traffic problem in the process of city\nexpansion, simulation results show that: the intuitions that with the same rate\nof particle generation and the same capacity and power, the smaller the network\nis the harder for the network to become congested; and the network will never\nbe congested if the power of each node equals or is bigger than its capacity\nare incorrect. And the distance from one crossroad to another and the width of\nthe roads can be designed properly, when designing a city, so as to enlarge the\ntolerance size of the city in the process of city expansion. This method may\nprovide more appropriate guide for real-life traffic design of network\ntransportation.\n",

Then system\nself-organizes and filters corresponding outer action, making it more robust to\nouter effect, with emergence of new behaviour not predictable from only\ncomponents study. Examples in Physics and Biology are given. Three main classes\nof complexity behaviour are distinguished corresponding to different grades of\ndifficulty to handle their dynamics. The interest of using complex state\nproperties in man-made systems is stressed. Important issues concentrating on\nthe difficult balance between relative system isolation when becoming complex\nand required delegation of corresponding new capability from (outside) operator\nare discussed. This implies giving the system some intelligence in an adequate\nframe between new augmented system state and supervising operator, with\nconsequences on canonical system triplet {effector-sensor-controller} to be\nreorganized in this new setting. Moreover, entering complexity state opens the\npossibility for function to feedback onto structure, ie to mimic at technical\nlevel the invention of Nature over Her very long history.\n",

The learning performance, analyzed in terms of the generalization\ncapability, of the proposed method is also shown to be superior to that of the\nconventional method.

        "summary": "  The Minority Game (MG), the Majority Game (MAJG) and the Dollar Game ($G) are\nimportant and closely-related versions of market-entry games designed to model\ndifferent features of real-world financial markets. In a variant of these\ngames, agents measure the performance of their available strategies over a\nfixed-length rolling window of prior time-steps. These are the so-called Time\nHorizon MG/MAJG/$G (THMG, THMAJG, TH$G). Their probabilistic dynamics may be\ncompletely characterized in Markov-chain formulation. Games of both the\nstandard and TH variants generate time-series that may be understood as arising\nfrom a stochastically perturbed determinism because a coin toss is used to\nbreak ties. The average over the binomially-distributed coin-tosses yields the\nunderlying determinism. In order to quantify the degree of this determinism and\nof higher-order perturbations, we decompose the sign of the time-series they\ngenerate (analogous to a market price time series) into a superposition of\nweighted Hamiltonian cycles on graphs (exactly in the TH variants and\napproximately in the standard versions). The cycle decomposition also provides\na ``dissection'' of the internal dynamics of the games and a quantitative\nmeasure of the degree of determinism. We discuss how the outperformance of\nstrategies relative to agents in the THMG (the ``illusion of control'') and the\nreverse in the THMAJG and TH$G (i.e., genuine control) may be understood on a\ncycle-by-cycle basis. The decomposition offers as well a new metric for\ncomparing different game dynamics to real-world financial time-series and a\nmethod for generating predictors. We apply the cycle predictor a real-world\nmarket, with significantly positive returns for the latter.\n",

Variation in replicating structures\nenhances the system's ability to maintain homeostasis in a changing environment\nby allowing it to evolve to a more restricted region of its state space.\nStability is further enhanced when replicating systems develop dependencies, by\nsharing information or resources. Such systems co-evolve, becoming more\nindependent of the external environment. Nested systems have a hierarchy of\ndependency but have low algorithmic entropy as they are in principle simpler to\ndescribe algorithmically. Nesting of replicating systems offsets the need for\nincreased variety by allowing the structures to increase in organizational\ncomplexity with little increase in algorithmic entropy.

We focus\ninterest on the activation of directed motion instigated by thermal\nfluctuations and the localized point force. In this context the local\ntransition states are identified and the corresponding activation energies are\ncalculated. As a novel feature it is found that the transport of the chain in\npoint force direction is determined by stepwise escapes of a single unit or\nsegments of the chain due to the existence of multiple locally stable\nattractors. The non-vanishing net current of the chain is quantitatively\nassessed by the value of the mobility of the center of mass. It turns out that\nthe latter as a function of the ratio of the competing length scales of the\nsystem, that is the period of the substrate potential and the equilibrium\ndistance between two chain units, shows a resonance behavior. More precisely\nthere exist a set of optimal parameter values maximizing the mobility.\nInterestingly, the phenomenon of negative resistance is found, i.e. the\nmobility possesses a minimum at a finite value of the strength of the thermal\nfluctuations for a given overcritical external driving force.\n",

If not, and\nthe outcome can be \"specified\", a randomness test is devised to determine\nwhether an observed low probability outcome indicates design. It is argued in\nthis paper that the Dembski test is unworkable and is better formulated in\nterms of a Martin Loef universal randomness test. A universal randomness test\nwill show that most observed outcomes in the natural world are non random; they\nare highly ordered. However this does not necessarily demonstrate design, as\nthe decision is not between chance and design, but between natural laws and\ndesign. The Dembski decision template, which eliminates natural processes in\nthe first decision step, is flawed, forcing a design outcome when none is\nwarranted. Dembski also introduces a 4th law of thermodynamics, the law of\nconservation of information to argue information cannot emerge from random\nprocesses. However if a more robust measure of information based on algorithmic\nentropy is used, the so called 4th law is seen to contain no more than the\nsecond law of thermodynamics.\n  In conclusion, despite the good intentions, the approach fails to offer any\nnew insights into the adequacy of evolutionary theory and should not be\nregarded as demonstrable science.\n",

A new research approach has been\nintroduced based on meta-structures, i.e. variable structures of mesoscopic\nvariables possibly suitable for a general theory of emergence. In this approach\nI consider the coherence of collective behaviours, i.e., their identity\ndetected by the observer, as represented by meta-structures. Meta-structures\nare properties of meta-elements, i.e., sets of values adopted by mesoscopic\nstate variables describing collective, structural aspects of the collective\nphenomenon under study and related to a higher level of description\n(meta-description) suitable for dealing with coherence. Mesoscopic state\nvariables are abductively identified by the observer detecting emergent\nproperties, such as sets of suitably clustered distances, speed, directions,\ntheir ratios and ergodic properties of sets. Simulation software is under\nimplementation. We present four research projects based on such an approach\nable to give the reader the perspective applications.\n",

The model consists of a number of units\ngrouped into systems that compete for the resource; within each system several\nunits can be aggregated into cooperative arrangements whose size is a measure\nof the degree of organization in the system. Aggression takes place when the\nsystems release inhibitors that impair the performance of other systems. Using\na mean field approximation we show that i) even in the case of identical\nsystems there are stable inhomogeneous solutions, ii) a system steadily\nproducing inhibitors needs large perturbations to leave this regime, and iii)\naggression may give comparative advantages. A discrete model is used in order\nto examine how the particular configuration of the units within a system\ndetermines its performance in the presence of aggression. We find that\nfull-scale, one sided aggression is only profitable for less-organized systems,\nand that systems with a mixture of degrees of organization exhibit robustness\nagainst aggression. By using a genetic algorithm we find that, in terms of the\nfull-occupation resource supply rate, the coevolution of the set of systems\ndisplays a variety of regimes. This kind of model can be useful to analyse the\ninterplay of the cooperation/competition processes that can be found in some\nsocial, economic, ecological and biochemical systems; as an illustration we\nrefer to the competition between drug-selling gangs.\n",

In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant\nsystems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially\nredundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly,\nthe magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by\ndifferences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests\nthat degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an\nimportant enabler of natural evolution. More generally, our study provides\nvaluable new clues about the origin of innovations in complex adaptive systems.\n",

In this approach, one separates\nout explicit \"system\" degrees of freedom (which are experimentally monitored)\nfrom all other implicit or \"bath\" degrees of freedom, and then one \"projects\"\nor integrates out all the implicit degrees of freedom. The result is the\ngeneralized Langevin equation. Within this formalism, the system PSD has a\nsimple relation to the bath PSD. We explore how several models of the bath PSD\naffect the system PSD. We suggest that analyzing the baseline can yield\nvaluable information on the bath. The Debye model of acoustic bath oscillations\nin particular gives rise to a low frequency 1/f divergence. Other power law\nbehaviors are possible with other models. None of these models require\nself-organized criticality.\n",

It is assumed that all the relay nodes\nare equipped with finite impulse response (FIR) filters and use a\nfilter-and-forward (FF) strategy to compensate for the transmitter-to-relay and\nrelay-to-destination channels.\n  Three relevant half-duplex distributed beamforming problems are considered.\nThe first problem amounts to minimizing the total relay transmitted power\nsubject to the destination quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. In the second\nand third problems, the destination QoS is maximized subject to the total and\nindividual relay transmitted power constraints, respectively. For the first and\nsecond problems, closed-form solutions are obtained, whereas the third problem\nis solved using convex optimization. The latter convex optimization technique\ncan be also directly extended to the case when the individual and total power\nconstraints should be jointly taken into account. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that in the frequency selective fading case, the proposed FF\napproach provides substantial performance improvements as compared to the\ncommonly used amplify-and-forward (AF) relay beamforming strategy.\n",

Two stable\nsynchronized clusters in anti-phase emerge when the learning rate is larger\nthan a critical value. In such a fast learning scenario, the network eventually\nconstructs itself into an all-to-all coupled structure, regardless of initial\nconditions in connectivity. In contrast, when learning is slower than this\ncritical value, only a single synchronized cluster can develop. Extending our\nanalysis, we explore whether self-development of neuronal networks can be\nachieved through an interaction between spontaneous neural synchronization and\nHebbian learning. We find that self-development of such neural systems is\nimpossible if learning is too slow. Finally, we demonstrate that similar to the\nacquisition and consolidation of long-term memory, this network is capable of\ngenerating and remembering stable patterns.\n",

Transient dynamics offers a sound formalism of the observed\nqualities of brain activity, while providing a rigorous set of analysis tools.\nTransients have two main features: First, they are resistant to noise, and\nreliable even in the face of small variations in initial conditions; the\nsequence of states visited by the system (its trajectory), is thus structurally\nstable. Second, the transients are input-specific, and thus convey information\nabout what caused them in the first place. This new dynamical view manifests a\nrigorous explanation of how perception, cognition, emotion, and other mental\nprocesses evolve as a sequence of activity patterns in the brain, and, most\nimportantly, how they interfere with each other.

Given these\nprerequisites, degenerate systems can readily produce a distributed systemic\nresponse to local perturbations. Reciprocally, excess resources related to a\nsingle function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a\ndegenerate system.

The conditions needed to achieve the networked buffering behavior are\nnot demanding or rare, leading us to conjecture that degeneracy may\nfundamentally underpin distributed robustness within several biological\nsystems. We further argue that degenerate forms of distributed robustness may\nreadily arise in other disciplines.

In such situations this social influence\ndecreases the ex ante predictability of the ensuing social dynamics. We claim\nthat, interestingly, these same social forces can increase the extent to which\nthe outcome of a social process can be predicted very early in the process.\nThis paper explores this claim through a theoretical and empirical analysis of\nthe experimental music market described and analyzed in [1]. We propose a very\nsimple model for this music market, assess the predictability of market\noutcomes through formal analysis of the model, and use insights derived through\nthis analysis to develop algorithms for predicting market share winners, and\ntheir ultimate market shares, in the very early stages of the market. The\nutility of these predictive algorithms is illustrated through analysis of the\nexperimental music market data sets [2].\n",

        "summary": "  The diffusion of information and behaviors over social networks is of\nconsiderable interest in research fields ranging from sociology to computer\nscience and application domains such as marketing, finance, human health, and\nnational security. Of particular interest is the possibility to develop\npredictive capabilities for social diffusion, for instance enabling early\nidentification of diffusion processes which are likely to become \"viral\" and\npropagate to a significant fraction of the population. Recently we have shown,\nusing theoretical analysis, that the dynamics of social diffusion may depend\ncrucially upon the interactions of social network communities, that is, densely\nconnected groupings of individuals which have only relatively few links between\ngroups. This paper presents an empirical investigation of two related\nhypotheses which follow from this finding: 1.) inter-community interaction is\npredictive of the reach of social diffusion and 2.) dispersion of the diffusion\nphenomenon across network communities is a useful early indicator that the\npropagation will be \"successful\". We explore these hypotheses with case studies\ninvolving the emergence of the Swedish Social Democratic Party at the turn of\nthe 20th century, the spread of the SARS virus in 2002-2003, and blogging\ndynamics associated with real world protest activity. These empirical studies\ndemonstrate that network community-based diffusion metrics do indeed possess\npredictive power, and in fact can be more useful than standard measures.\n",

The main result is that spike trains statistics are\ncharacterized by a Gibbs distribution, whose potential is explicitly\ncomputable. This establishes, on one hand, a rigorous ground for the current\ninvestigations attempting to characterize real spike trains data with Gibbs\ndistributions, such as the Ising-like distribution, using the maximal entropy\nprinciple. However, it transpires from the present analysis that the Ising\nmodel might be a rather weak approximation. Indeed, the Gibbs potential (the\nformal \"Hamiltonian\") is the log of the so-called \"conditional intensity\" (the\nprobability that a neuron fires given the past of the whole network). But, in\nthe present example, this probability has an infinite memory, and the\ncorresponding process is non-Markovian (resp. the Gibbs potential has infinite\nrange). Moreover, causality implies that the conditional intensity does not\ndepend on the state of the neurons at the \\textit{same time}, ruling out the\nIsing model as a candidate for an exact characterization of spike trains\nstatistics. However, Markovian approximations can be proposed whose degree of\napproximation can be rigorously controlled. In this setting, Ising model\nappears as the \"next step\" after the Bernoulli model (independent neurons)\nsince it introduces spatial pairwise correlations, but not time correlations.\nThe range of validity of this approximation is discussed together with possible\napproaches allowing to introduce time correlations, with algorithmic\nextensions.\n",

By using a PDE (partial differential equation) approximation in the\nlimit of large number of vehicles, we show that heterogeneity has little effect\nwhile asymmetry has a significant effect on the stability margin. When control\nis symmetric, the stability margin decays to 0 as $O(1/N^2)$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of agents, even when the agents are heterogeneous in their masses and\ncontrol gains. In contrast, we show that arbitrarily small amount of asymmetry\nin the velocity feedback gains can improve the decay of the stability margin to\n$O(1/N)$. Poor design of such asymmetry makes the closed loop unstable for\nsufficiently large $N$. With equal amount of asymmetry in both position and\nvelocity feedback gains, the closed loop is stable for arbitrary $N$ and the\nstability margin scaling trend can also be improved to $O(1/N)$, but the\nsensitivity to disturbance becomes worse. Effect of asymmetry in position\nfeedback gains alone and unequal amount of asymmetry in position and velocity\nfeedback are open problems. Numerical computations are provided to corroborate\nthe analysis.\n",

I relate this\nview with Kauffman's 'Fourth Law of Thermodynamics', which I interprete as a\nproposition about the accumulation of information in evolutionary processes.\nThe concept of physical work is expanded to including work directed at the\ncapacity to work: I offer a twofold specification of Kauffman's concept of an\n'autonomous agent', one as a 'self-referential heat engine', and the other in\nterms of physiosemeiosis, which is a naturalized application of Peirce's theory\nof signs. The conjunction of these three theoretical sources, Maximum Entropy,\nKauffman's Fourth Law, and physiosemeiosis, shows that the Kleidon restatement\nof the Gaia hypothesis is equivalent to the proposition that the biosphere is\ngenerating, processing and storing information, thus directly treating\ninformation as a physical phenomenon. There is a fundamental ontological\ncontinuity between the biological processes and the human economy, as both are\nseen as information processing and entropy producing systems.

Synchronization of this timer to the\nenvironmental light-dark cycle is crucial for an organism's fitness. In a\nrecent theoretical and experimental study it was shown that coupling governs\nthe entrainment range of circadian clocks. We apply the theory of coupled\noscillators to analyse how diffusive and mean-field coupling affects the\nentrainment range of interacting cells. Mean-field coupling leads to amplitude\nexpansion of weak oscillators and, as a result, reduces the entrainment range.\nWe also show that coupling determines the rigidity of the synchronized SCN\nnetwork, i.e. the relaxation rates upon perturbation. %(Floquet exponents). Our\nsimulations and analytical calculations using generic oscillator models help to\nelucidate how coupling determines the entrainment of the SCN. Our theoretical\nframework helps to interpret experimental data.\n",

Two types of information\ngraphs are considered: directed trees and undirected graphs. We prove stability\nof the formation with arbitrary number of vehicles for linear as well as a\nclass of nonlinear controllers. In the case of linear control, we provide\nquantitative scaling laws of the stability margin and sensitivity to external\ndisturbances (H-infinity norm) with respect to the number of vehicles $N$ in\nthe formation. It is shown that the formation with directed tree graph achieves\nsize-independent stability margin but suffers from high algebraic growth of\ninitial errors. The stability margin in case of the undirected graph decays to\n0 as at least $O(1/N)$. In addition, we show that the sensitivity to external\ndisturbances in directed tree graphs is geometric in $k$ where $k <= N$ is the\nnumber of generations of the directed tree, while that of the undirected graph\nis only quadratic in $N$. In particular, for 1-D vehicular platoons, we obtain\nprecise formulae for the H-infinity norm of the transfer function from the\ndisturbances to the position errors. It is shown that the H-infinity norm\nscales as $O(\\alpha^N) (\\alpha>1)$ for predecessor-following architecture, but\nonly as $O(N^3)$ for symmetric bidirectional architectures. For a class of\nnonlinear controllers, numerical simulations show that the transient response\ndue to initial errors and sensitivity to external disturbances are improved\nconsiderably for the formation with directed tree graphs. However, by using the\nnonlinear controller considered, little improvement can be made for that with\nundirected graphs.\n",

With this, a mathematical concept of\nself-shaping dynamical systems is proposed. Initially there is a zero vector\nfield and an \"empty\" phase space with no attractors or other non-trivial\nobjects. As the random stimulus begins, the vector field deforms and eventually\nbecomes smooth and deterministic, despite the random nature of the applied\nforce, while the phase space develops various geometrical objects. We consider\ngradient self-shaping systems, whose vector field is the gradient of some\nenergy function, which under certain conditions develops into the\nmulti-dimensional probability density distribution (PDD) of the input.\nSelf-shaping systems are relevant to neural networks (NNs) of two types:\nHopfield, and probabilistic. Firstly, we show that they can potentially perform\npattern recognition tasks traditionally delegated to Hopfield NNs, but without\nsupervision and on-line, and without developing spurious minima of the energy.\nSecondly, like probabilistic NNs, they can reconstruct the PDD of input\nsignals, without the limitation that new training patterns have to enter as new\nhardware units. Thus, self-shaping systems can be regarded as a generalization\nof the NN concept, achieved by abandoning the \"rigid units\" - \"flexible\ncouplings\" paradigm and making the vector field fully flexible and amenable to\nexternal force. The new concept presents an engineering challenge requiring new\nprinciples of hardware design. It might also become an alternative paradigm for\nmodeling of living and learning systems.\n",

        "summary": "  TheMinority Game (MG) has become a paradigm to probe complex social and\neconomical phenomena where adaptive agents compete for a limited resource, and\nit finds applications in statistical and nonlinear physics as well. In the\ntraditional MG model, agents are assumed to have access to global information\nabout the past history of the underlying system, and they react by choosing one\nof the two available options associated with a single resource. Complex systems\narising in a modern society, however, can possess many resources so that the\nnumber of available strategies/resources can be multiple. We propose a class of\nmodels to investigate MG dynamics with multiple strategies. In particular, in\nsuch a system, at any time an agent can either choose a minority strategy (say\nwith probability p) based on available local information or simply choose a\nstrategy randomly (with probability 1 - p). The parameter p thus defines the\nminority-preference probability, which is key to the dynamics of the underlying\nsystem. A striking finding is the emergence of strategy-grouping states where a\nparticular number of agents choose a particular subset of strategies. We\ndevelop an analytic theory based on the mean-field framework to understand the\n\"bifurcation\" to the grouping states and their evolution. The grouping\nphenomenon has also been revealed in a real-world example of the subsystem of\n27 stocks in the Shanghai Stock Market's Steel Plate. Our work demonstrates\nthat complex systems following the MG rules can spontaneously self-organize\nthemselves into certain divided states, and our model represents a basic\nmathematical framework to address this kind of phenomena in social, economical,\nand even political systems.\n",

Using a generic form of\nthese rules we explore the collective behavior and emergent dynamics of a\nsimulated swarm. For a wide range of flock size and interaction extent (the\nfixed number of neighbors with which an individual will interact) we find that\nthe computational collective is inherently stable --- individuals are attracted\nto one another and will position themselves a preferred distance from their\nfixed neighbors within a rigid lattice. Nonetheless, the irregular overall\nshape of the flock, coupled with the need for individuals on the boundary to\nmove towards their neighbors creates a torque which leads the flock to rotate\nand then meander. We argue that this \"rolling meander\" is a very good proxy for\nreal collective behavior in animal species and yet arises from a simple\nhomogeneous and deterministic rule for interaction. Rather than then introduce\nleaders --- which has already been shown, quite straightforwardly, to drive\ncollective swarms such as this --- we introduce a small number of \"followers\".\nEach follower is bound to consider a random fixed individual to be among their\nneighbors, irrespective of actual metric distance between them. We find that\nthe introduction of a small number of such followers causes a phase transition\nthat quickly leads to instability in the flock structure (as no stable\nconfiguration arises) and the previously rigid crystalline interaction among\nneighbors now becomes fluid: the distance between neighbors decreases, the\nflock ceases to rotate and meanders less.\n",

The dynamics of such systems is governed solely by interactions\namong individuals or \"agents,\" with the tendency to adjust to their\n`environmental averages'. This, in turn, leads to the formation of clusters,\ne.g., colonies of ants, flocks of birds, parties of people, etc. A natural\nquestion which arises in this context is to understand when and how clusters\nemerge through the self-alignment of agents, and what type of \"rules of\nengagement\" influence the formation of such clusters. Of particular interest to\nus are cases in which the self-organized behavior tends to concentrate into one\ncluster, reflecting a consensus of opinions, flocking or concentration of other\npositions intrinsic to the dynamics.\n  Many standard models for self-organized dynamics in social, biological and\nphysical science assume that the intensity of alignment increases as agents get\ncloser, reflecting a common tendency to align with those who think or act\nalike. Moreover, \"Similarity breeds connection,\" reflects our intuition that\nincreasing the intensity of alignment as the difference of positions decreases,\nis more likely to lead to a consensus. We argue here that the converse is true:\nwhen the dynamics is driven by local interactions, it is more likely to\napproach a consensus when the interactions among agents \\emph{increase} as a\nfunction of their difference in position. \\emph{Heterophily} --- the tendency\nto bond more with those who are different rather than with those who are\nsimilar, plays a decisive r\\^{o}le in the process of clustering. We point out\nthat the number of clusters in heterophilious dynamics \\emph{decreases} as the\nheterophily dependence among agents increases. In particular, sufficiently\nstrong heterophilious interactions enhance consensus.\n",

Two classes of\ncompetition rules, transitive and intransitive, need to be distinguished.\nTransitive competitions are shown to be consistent (at least qualitatively)\nwith thermodynamic principles, which allows for introduction of special\ncompetitive thermodynamics. Competitive systems can thus be characterised by\nthermodynamic quantities (such as competitive entropy and competitive\npotential), which determine that the predominant direction of evolution of the\nsystem is directed towards higher competitiveness. There is, however, an\nimportant difference: while conventional thermodynamics is constrained by its\nzeroth law and is fundamentally transitive, the transitivity of competitive\nthermodynamics depends on the transitivity of the competition rules. The\nanalogy with conventional thermodynamics weakens as competitive systems become\nmore intransitive, while strongly intransitive competitions can display types\nof behaviour associated with complexity: competitive cooperation and leaping\ncycles.

In this paper, we have demonstrated the occurrence of multi-stable\nstates in a system of identical phase oscillators that are dynamically coupled.\nWe find that the multi-stable state is comprised of a two cluster\nsynchronization state where the clusters are in anti-phase relationship with\neach other and a desynchronization state. We also find that the phase\nrelationship between the oscillators is asymptotically stable irrespective of\nwhether there is synchronization or desynchronization in the system. The time\nscale of the coupling affects the size of the clusters in the two cluster\nstate. We also investigate the effect of both the coupling asymmetry and\nplasticity asymmetry on the multi-stable states. In the absence of coupling\nasymmetry, increasing the plasticity asymmetry causes the system to go from a\ntwo clustered state to a desynchronization state and then to a two clustered\nstate. Further, the coupling asymmetry, if present, also affects this\ntransition.

        "summary": "  This paper proposes a variational approach to describe the evolution of\norganization of complex systems from first principles, as increased efficiency\nof physical action. Most simply stated, physical action is the product of the\nenergy and time necessary for motion. When complex systems are modeled as flow\nnetworks, this efficiency is defined as a decrease of action for one element to\ncross between two nodes, or endpoints of motion - a principle of least unit\naction. We find a connection with another principle that of most total action,\nor a tendency for increase of the total action of a system. This increase\nprovides more energy and time for minimization of the constraints to motion in\norder to decrease unit action, and therefore to increase organization. Also,\nwith the decrease of unit action in a system, its capacity for total amount of\naction increases. We present a model of positive feedback between action\nefficiency and the total amount of action in a complex system, based on a\nsystem of ordinary differential equations, which leads to an exponential growth\nwith time of each and a power law relation between the two. We present an\nagreement of our model with data for core processing units of computers. This\napproach can help to describe, measure, manage, design and predict future\nbehavior of complex systems to achieve the highest rates of self-organization\nand robustness.\n",

The moving magnets are coupled\ntogether by an electrical circuit. The nonlinearity of the system is achieved\nby the variable distance between the moving and static magnets, and\nadditionally by the mass difference between them.

Both thermodynamic\n(equilibrium) and time varying (non-steady state) properties of a landfill are\naffected by spatially heterogenous and nonlinear subprocesses that combine with\nconstraining initial and boundary conditions arising from the associated\nsurroundings. While multiple approaches have been made to model landfill\nstatistics by incorporating spatially dependent parameters on the one hand\n(data based approach) and continuum dynamical mass-balance equations on the\nother (equation based modelling), practically no attempt has been made to\namalgamate these two approaches while also incorporating inherent\nstochastically induced fluctuations affecting the process overall. In this\narticle, we will implement a minimalist scheme of modelling the time evolution\nof a realistic three dimensional landfill through a reaction-diffusion based\napproach, focusing on the coupled interactions of four key variables - solid\nmass density, hydrolysed mass density, acetogenic mass density and methanogenic\nmass density. In a marked departure from previous predictions, our results\nindicate that close to the linearly stable limit, the large time steady state\nproperties, arising out of a series of complex coupled interactions between the\nstochastically driven variables, are scarcely affected by the biochemical\ngrowth-decay statistics. Our results clearly show that an equilibrium landfill\nstructure relates to plant production times of approximately 20-30 years\ninstead of the previous (incorrect) deterministic model predictions of 50 years\nand above.\n",

I argue that complexity is an emergent property of this\nstructural/functional hierarchy, induced by a property - fitness in the case of\nbiological systems and meaning in the case of languages - that links the\nelements of this hierarchy across multiple scales. Additionally, I argue that\nnon-complex systems \"are\" while complex systems \"do\" so that the latter, in\ndistinction to physical systems, must be described not only in a space of\nstates but also in a space of update rules (strategies) which we do not know\nhow to specify.

Two scenarios are\nconsidered: continuous monitoring, that each node can observe its\nneighborhood's instantaneous states, and discrete monitoring, that each node\ncan only obtain its neighborhood's states at the same time point when the\ncoupling term is triggered.

We here propose an effective network whose\ntopological properties reflect the interplay between the topology and dynamics\nof the original network. On that basis, we are able to introduce the\n\"synchronization centrality\", a measure which quantifies the role and\nimportance of each network's node in the synchronization process. In\nparticular, we use such a measure to assess the propensity of a graph to\nsynchronize explosively, thus indicating a unified framework for most of the\ndifferent models proposed so far for such an irreversible transition. Taking\nadvantage of the predicting power of this measure, we furthermore discuss a\nstrategy to induce the explosive behavior in a generic network, by acting only\nupon a small fraction of its nodes.\n",

The underlying activated processes present\nthe multidimensional extension of the Kramers problem of a single Brownian\nparticle.

In this\nreview we report on a variety of such phenomena that are exhibited by systems\nconsisting of chains of interacting units in the presence of potential\nbarriers.\n  In the first part we consider recent developments in the case of a\ndeterministic dynamics driving cooperative escape processes of coupled\nnonlinear units out of metastable states. The ability of chains of coupled\nunits to undergo spontaneous conformational transitions can lead to a\nself-organised escape. The mechanism at work is that the energies of the units\nbecome re-arranged, while keeping the total energy conserved, in forming\nlocalised energy modes that in turn trigger the cooperative escape. We present\nscenarios of significantly enhanced noise-free escape rates if compared to the\nnoise-assisted case.\n  The second part deals with the collective directed transport of systems of\ninteracting particles overcoming energetic barriers in periodic potential\nlandscapes. Escape processes in both time-homogeneous and time-dependent driven\nsystems are considered for the emergence of directed motion. It is shown that\nballistic channels immersed in the associated high-dimensional phase space are\nthe source for the directed long-range transport.\n",

The approach is based in\nthe introduction of a collective coordinate for the time evolution of the phase\nlocked oscillators, in the spirit of the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. We show that the\noptimal synchronization of a Kuramoto network demands the maximization of the\nquadratic function $\\omega^T L \\omega$, where $\\omega$ stands for the vector of\nthe natural frequencies of the oscillators, and $L$ for the network Laplacian\nmatrix. Many recently obtained numerical results can be re-obtained\nanalytically and in a simpler way from our maximization condition. A\ncomputationally efficient {hill climb} rewiring algorithm is proposed to\ngenerate networks with optimal synchronization properties. Our approach can be\neasily adapted to the case of the Kuramoto models with both attractive and\nrepulsive interactions, and again many recent numerical results can be\nrederived in a simpler and clearer analytical manner.\n",

A rigorous mean-field analysis is implemented to predict\nthe possible steady states. Furthermore, a detailed linear stability analysis\nproves that the incoherent state is only neutrally stable below the\nsynchronization threshold. Nevertheless, interestingly, the amplitude of the\norder parameter decays exponentially (at least for short time) in this regime,\nresembling the Landau damping effect in plasma physics. Moreover, the explicit\nexpression for the critical coupling strength is determined by both the\nmean-field method and linear operator theory. The mechanism of bifurcation for\nthe incoherent state near the critical point is further revealed by the\namplitude expansion theory, which shows that the oscillating standing wave\nstate could also occur in this model for certain frequency distributions. Our\ntheoretical analysis and numerical results are consistent with each other,\nwhich can help us understand the synchronization transition in general networks\nwith heterogenous couplings.\n",

We address\nthe question of whether a complex network of nonlinear oscillators can maintain\nits synchronization stability as it expands or grows. A network in the real\nworld can never be completely synchronized due to noise and/or external\ndisturbances. This is especially the case when, mathematically, the transient\nsynchronous state during the growth process becomes marginally stable, as a\nlocal perturbation can trigger a rapid deviation of the system from the\nvicinity of the synchronous state. In terms of the nodal dynamics, a large\nscale avalanche over the entire network can be triggered in the sense that the\nindividual nodal dynamics diverge from the synchronous state in a cascading\nmanner within a short time period. Because of the high dimensionality of the\nnetworked system, the transient process for the system to recover to the\nsynchronous state can be extremely long. Introducing a tolerance threshold to\nidentify the desynchronized nodes, we find that, after an initial stage of\nlinear growth, the network typically evolves into a critical state where the\naddition of a single new node can cause a group of nodes to lose\nsynchronization, leading to synchronization collapse for the entire network. A\nstatistical analysis indicates that, the distribution of the size of the\ncollapse is approximately algebraic (power law), regardless of the fluctuations\nin the system parameters. This is indication of the emergence of self-organized\ncriticality. We demonstrate the generality of the phenomenon of synchronization\ncollapse using a variety of complex network models, and uncover the underlying\ndynamical mechanism through an eigenvector analysis.\n",

The two phenomena have stimulated\ninvestigations and de- bates, attracting attention in many relevant fields. So\nfar, various substantial contributions and progresses (including experimental\nverifications) have been made, which have provided insights on what structural\nand dynamical properties are needed for inducing such abrupt transformations,\nas well as have greatly enhanced our understanding of phase transitions in\nnetworked systems. Our intention is to offer here a monographic review on the\nmain-stream literature, with the twofold aim of summarizing the existing\nresults and pointing out possible directions for future research.\n",

E\n85, 026208 (2012)], where synchronization in a star network of Stuart-Landau\noscillators was investigated. In the RS regime therein described, the central\nhub served as a transmitter of information between peripheral nodes, while\nmaintaining independent dynamics that were asynchronous with the rest of the\nnetwork. One of the key conclusions of that paper was that RS cannot occur in\npure phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that the RS regime can exist in\nnetworks of Kuramoto oscillators, and that hub nodes can actively drive remote\nsynchronization even in the presence of a repulsive mean field. We apply this\nmodel to study the synchronization dynamics in complex networks endowed with\nhub-nodes, an ubiquitous feature of many natural networks. We show that a\nchange in the natural frequency of a hub can alone reshape synchronization\npatterns, and switch from direct to remote synchronization, or to hub-driven\ndesynchronization. We discuss the potential role of this phenomenon in\nreal-world networks, including the Karate-club and brain connectivity networks.\n",

The classical modelling paradigm is that\nlong term memories correspond to stable steady states of a Hopfield network\nwith Hebbian connectivity. Experiments show that short term synaptic depression\nplays an important role in the processing of memories. This leads naturally to\na computational model of priming, called latching dynamics; a stable state\n(prime) can become unstable and the system may converge to another transiently\nstable steady state (target). Hopfield network models of latching dynamics have\nbeen studied by means of numerical simulation, however the conditions for the\nexistence of this dynamics have not been elucidated. In this work we use a\ncombination of analytic and numerical approaches to confirm that latching\ndynamics can exist in the context of Hebbian learning, however lacks robustness\nand imposes a number of biologically unrealistic restrictions on the model. In\nparticular our work shows that the symmetry of the Hebbian rule is not an\nobstruction to the existence of latching dynamics, however fine tuning of the\nparameters of the model is needed.\n",

When the\nperturbation by a WPS modulated with the noise is optimum, the UJT-RO has been\nobserved to produce regular dynamics that mimics the WPS maximum, which is\ntermed as stochastic resonance (SR). Interestingly, when the noise component is\nreplaced by a HFS, the system shows the same SR kind of behavior, which is\ncalled vibrational resonance (VR). Here the system produces the dynamics that\nmimics the WPS resembling the SR assisted by the optimum level of HFS. Both SR\nand VR have been confirmed through PSPICE simulation. The results show that the\nregular dynamics that mimics the WPS in case of HFS modulation is better than\nthe noise perturbation.\n",

We apply techniques\npreviously used for approximating the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix to\nthe Laplacian matrix, allowing us to quantify the effects that the primary and\nsecondary subnetworks have on diffusion and synchronization in terms of a\ncoupling parameter that weighs the secondary subnetwork relative to the primary\nsubnetwork. Diffusion processes are separated into two regimes: for small\ncoupling the diffusion rate is determined by the structure of the secondary\nnetwork, scaling with the coupling parameter, while for large coupling it is\ndetermined by the primary network and saturates. Synchronization, on the other\nhand, is separated into three regimes: for both small and large coupling\nhierarchical products have poorly synchronization properties, but is optimized\nat an intermediate value. Moreover, the critical coupling value that optimizes\nsynchronization is shaped by the relative connectivities of the primary and\nsecondary subnetworks, compensating for significant differences between the two\nsubnetworks.\n",

In these\nnonequilibrium systems, stochastic dynamics often induces switching between\ndistinct states on emergent timescales, for example, bistable switching is a\nnatural feature of noisy, spatially-extended systems that consist of bistable\nelements. Nevertheless, here we present experimental evidence that bistable\nelements are not required for the global bistability of a system. We observe\ntemporal switching between a crystalline, condensed state and a gas-like,\nexcited state in a spatially-extended, quasi-two-dimensional system of charged\nmicroparticles. Accompanying numerical simulations show that conservative\nforces, damping, and stochastic noise are sufficient to prevent steady-state\nequilibrium, leading to switching between the two states over a range of time\nscales, from seconds to hours.\n",

        "summary": "  Synchronization of non-identical oscillators coupled through complex networks\nis an important example of collective behavior. It is interesting to ask how\nthe structural organization of network interactions influences this process.\nSeveral studies have uncovered optimal topologies for synchronization by making\npurposeful alterations to a network. Yet, the connectivity patterns of many\nnatural systems are often not static, but are rather modulated over time\naccording to their dynamics. This co-evolution - and the extent to which the\ndynamics of the individual units can shape the organization of the network\nitself - is not well understood. Here, we study initially randomly connected\nbut locally adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators. The system employs a\nco-evolutionary rewiring strategy that depends only on instantaneous, pairwise\nphase differences of neighboring oscillators, and that conserves the total\nnumber of edges, allowing the effects of local reorganization to be isolated.\nWe find that a simple regulatory rule - which preserves connections between\nmore out-of-phase oscillators while rewiring connections between more in-phase\noscillators - can cause initially disordered networks to organize into more\nstructured topologies that support enhanced synchronization dynamics. We\nexamine how this process unfolds over time, finding both a dependence on the\nintrinsic frequencies of the oscillators and the global coupling. For large\nenough coupling and after sufficient adaptation, the resulting networks exhibit\ndegree - frequency and frequency - neighbor frequency correlations. These\nproperties have previously been associated with optimal synchronization or\nexplosive transitions. By considering a time-dependent interplay between\nstructure and dynamics, this work offers a mechanism through which emergent\nphenomena can arise in complex systems utilizing local rules.\n",

We demonstrate an interesting transition from a unimodal to a\nbimodal PDF as the multiplicative noise increases for a fixed value of the\nadditive noise.

With the aim of\nrepresenting the satiety of hunters when preys are overabundant, we introduce\nfor the predation behavior a dependence on preys density. Specifically,\npredation is modeled as growing proportionally to the presence of herbivores at\nlow density, and saturating when the total population of prey is sufficiently\nlarge. The model predicts the existence of different regimes depending on the\nparameters considered: survival of a single species, coexistence of two species\nand extinction of the third one, and coexistence of the three species. But more\ninterestingly, in some regions parameters space the solutions oscillate in\ntime, both as a transient phenomena and as persistent oscillations of constant\namplitude. The phenomenon is not present for the more idealized linear\npredation model, suggesting that it can be the source of real ecosystems\noscillations.\n",

By treating each\noscillator as a black-box possessing a single-input single-output, we provide a\npractical and simply realizable control algorithm to attain the in-phase\nsynchrony of the network. For a general diffusive-type coupling law and any\nvalue of a coupling strength (even greatly below the synchronization threshold)\nthe delayed feedback control with a specially adjusted time-delays can provide\nin-phase synchronization. Such adjustment of the delay times performed in an\nautomatic fashion by the use of an adaptive version of the delayed feedback\nalgorithm when time-delays become time-dependent slowly varying control\nparameters. Analytical results show that there are many arrangements of the\ntime-delays for the in-phase synchronization, therefore we supplement the\nalgorithm by an additional requirement to choose appropriate set of the\ntime-delays, which minimize power of a control force. Performed numerical\nvalidations of the predictions highlights the usefulness of our approach.\n",

When we turn our attention to the asymmetric case we find that the\nsymmetry-breaking complicates the bifurcation diagram.

Over the\npast decade a great deal of progress has been made in analytical descriptions\nof the macroscopic dynamics of the Kuramoto mode, facilitated by the discovery\nof Ott and Antonsen's dimensionality reduction method. However, the vast\nmajority of these works relies on a critical assumption where the oscillators'\nnatural frequencies are drawn from a Cauchy, or Lorentzian, distribution, which\nallows for a convenient closure of the evolution equations from the\ndimensionality reduction. In this paper we investigate the low dimensional\ndynamics that emerge from a broader family of natural frequency distributions,\nin particular a family of rational distribution functions. We show that, as the\npolynomials that characterize the frequency distribution increase in order, the\nlow dimensional evolution equations become more complicated, but nonetheless\nthe system dynamics remain simple, displaying a transition from incoherence to\npartial synchronization at a critical coupling strength. Using the low\ndimensional equations we analytically calculate the critical coupling strength\ncorresponding to the onset of synchronization and investigate the scaling\nproperties of the order parameter near the onset of synchronization.

        "summary": "  Recent works suggest that pooling and sharing may constitute a fundamental\nmechanism for the evolution of cooperation in well-mixed fluctuating\nenvironments. The rationale is that, by reducing the amplitude of fluctuations,\npooling and sharing increases the steady-state growth rate at which the\nindividuals self-reproduce. However, in reality interactions are seldom\nrealized in a well-mixed structure, and the underlying topology is in general\ndescribed by a complex network. Motivated by this observation, we investigate\nthe role of the network structure on the cooperative dynamics in fluctuating\nenvironments, by developing a model for networked pooling and sharing of\nresources undergoing environmental fluctuations, represented through geometric\nBrownian motion. The study reveals that, while in general cooperation increases\nthe individual steady state growth rates (i.e. is evolutionary advantageous),\nthe interplay with the network structure may yield large discrepancies in the\nobserved individual resource endowments. We comment possible biological and\nsocial implications and discuss relations to econophysics.\n",

Specifically, synaptic\nchanges often co-occur and interact with myelin changes, leading to complex\ndynamic interactions between these processes. Here, we investigate the\nimplications of these interactions for the coupling behavior of a system of\nKuramoto oscillators. To that end, we construct a fully connected,\none-dimensional ring network of phase oscillators whose coupling strength\n(reflecting synaptic strength) as well as conduction velocity (reflecting\nmyelination) are each regulated by a Hebbian learning rule. We evaluate the\nbehavior of the system in terms of structural (pairwise connection strength and\nconduction velocity) and functional connectivity (local and global\nsynchronization behavior). We find that for conditions in which a system\nlimited to synaptic plasticity develops two distinct clusters both structurally\nand functionally, additional adaptive myelination allows for functional\ncommunication across these structural clusters. Hence, dynamic conduction\nvelocity permits the functional integration of structurally segregated\nclusters. Our results confirm that network states following learning may be\ndifferent when myelin plasticity is considered in addition to synaptic\nplasticity, pointing towards the relevance of integrating both factors in\ncomputational models of learning.\n",

A selective way of birds that reacts to their neighbors is\none of the main factors characterizing the collective behaviors. Individual\nbirds can react differently depending on their local environment during the\ncollective decision-making process, and these variable reactions can be a\nsource of complex spatiotemporal flocking dynamics.

Simulation results show that the adaptive reaction of individuals\ninduces the collective response of the flock.

However, the\ninteraction structures among oscillators are static in most of studies on\nchimera state. In this work, we consider a population of agents. Each agent\ncarries a phase oscillator. We assume that agents perform Brownian motions on a\nring and interact with each other with a kernel function dependent on the\ndistance between them. When agents are motionless, the model allows for several\ndynamical states including two different chimera states (the type-I and the\ntype-II chimeras). The movement of agents changes the relative positions among\nthem and produces perpetual noise to impact on the model dynamics. We find that\nthe response of the coupled phase oscillators to the movement of agents depends\non both the phase lag $\\alpha$, determining the stabilities of chimera states,\nand the agent mobility $D$. For low mobility, the synchronous state transits to\nthe type-I chimera state for $\\alpha$ close to $\\pi/2$ and attracts other\ninitial states otherwise. For intermediate mobility, the coupled oscillators\nrandomly jump among different dynamical states and the jump dynamics depends on\n$\\alpha$. We investigate the statistical properties in these different\ndynamical regimes and present the scaling laws between the transient time and\nthe mobility for low mobility and relations between the mean lifetimes of\ndifferent dynamical states and the mobility for intermediate mobility.\n",

Here we show that\nhigher-order interactions between coupled phase oscillators, encoded\nmicroscopically in a simplicial complex, give rise to added nonlinearity in the\nmacroscopic system dynamics that induces abrupt synchronization transitions via\nhysteresis and bistability of synchronized and incoherent states. Moreover,\nthese higher-order interactions can stabilize strongly synchronized states even\nwhen the pairwise coupling is repulsive. These findings reveal a self-organized\nphenomenon that may be responsible for the rapid switching to synchronization\nin many biological and other systems that exhibit synchronization without the\nneed of particular correlation mechanisms between the oscillators and the\ntopological structure.\n",

The dynamic range of an excitable network quantifies the\nrange of stimulus intensities that can be robustly distinguished by the network\nresponse, and is maximized at the critical state. In this study, we examine the\nimpacts of backtracking activation on system criticality in excitable networks\nconsisting of both excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, for dynamics\nwith refractory states that prohibit backtracking activation, the critical\nstate occurs when the largest eigenvalue of the weighted non-backtracking (WNB)\nmatrix for excitatory units, $\\lambda^E_{NB}$, is close to one, regardless of\nthe strength of inhibition. In contrast, for dynamics without refractory state\nin which backtracking activation is allowed, the strength of inhibition affects\nthe critical condition through suppression of backtracking activation. As\ninhibitory strength increases, backtracking activation is gradually suppressed.\nAccordingly, the system shifts continuously along a continuum between two\nextreme regimes -- from one where the criticality is determined by the largest\neigenvalue of the weighted adjacency matrix for excitatory units,\n$\\lambda^E_W$, to the other where the critical state is reached when\n$\\lambda_{NB}^E$ is close to one. For systems in between, we find that\n$\\lambda^E_{NB}<1$ and $\\lambda^E_W>1$ at the critical state.

In the first scenario, shown for the two rotators in\nthe excitable regime, inverse stochastic resonance emerges due to a biased\nswitching between the oscillatory and the quasi-stationary metastable states\nderived from the attractors of the noiseless system.

As the coupling increases, the cores acquire concentric\nregions of constant time-averaged frequencies, the chimera becomes\nquasiperiodic. Eventually, with a subsequent increase in the coupling strength,\nonly one such region is left, i.e., the whole core becomes frequency-coherent.\nAn essential modification of the system behavior occurs, when the parameter\npoint enters the so-called solitary} region. Then, isolated oscillators are\nnormally present on the spiral core background of the chimera states.

The model aims to reproduce the nest construction process in arboreal\nNasutitermes termites, whose cooperation may similarly be mediated by the shape\nof the structure they are walking on, for example focusing the building\nactivity of termites where local mean curvature is high. We adopt a phase-field\nmodel where the nest is described by one continuous scalar field and its growth\nis governed by a single nonlinear equation with one adjustable parameter d.\nWhen d is large enough the equation is linearly unstable and fairly reproduces\na growth process where the initial walls expand, branch and merge, while\nprogressively invading all the available space, which is consistent with the\nintricate structures of real nests. Interestingly, the linear problem\nassociated to our growth equation is analogous to the buckling of a thin\nelastic plate under symmetric in-plane compression which is also known to\nproduce rich pattern through non linear and secondary instabilities. We\nvalidated our model by collecting nests of two species of arboreal Nasutitermes\nfrom the field and imaging their structure with a micro-CT scanner.

Based on Krasovskii-Lyapunov\nstability theory, the sufficient conditions (on the synaptic strengths and\nmagnetic gain parameters) for the chaotic synchronization of the improved model\nare obtained. Based on Helmholtz's theorem, the Hamilton function of the\ncorresponding error dynamical system is also obtained. It is shown that the\ntime variation of this Hamilton function along trajectories can play the role\nof the time variation of the Lyapunov function - in determining the asymptotic\nstability of the synchronization manifold. Numerical computations indicate that\nas the synaptic strengths and the magnetic gain parameters change, the time\nvariation of the Hamilton function is always non-zero (i.e., a relatively large\npositive or negative value) only when the time variation of the Lyapunov\nfunction is positive, and zero (or vanishingly small) only when the time\nvariation of the Lyapunov function is also zero.

One of the main\nchallenges of Network Science consists in predicting the impact of network\ntopology and dynamics on the evolution of the states and, especially, on the\nemergence of collective phenomena, such as synchronization. We address this\nproblem by proposing a Dynamics Approximate Reduction Technique (DART) that\nmaps high-dimensional (complete) dynamics unto low-dimensional (reduced)\ndynamics while preserving the most salient features, both topological and\ndynamical, of the original system. DART generalizes recent approaches for\ndimension reduction by allowing the treatment of complex-valued dynamical\nvariables, heterogeneities in the intrinsic properties of the nodes as well as\nmodular networks with strongly interacting communities. Most importantly, we\nidentify three major reduction procedures whose relative accuracy depends on\nwhether the evolution of the states is mainly determined by the intrinsic\ndynamics, the degree sequence, or the adjacency matrix. We use phase\nsynchronization of oscillator networks as a benchmark for our threefold method.\nWe successfully predict the synchronization curves for three phase dynamics\n(Winfree, Kuramoto, theta) on the stochastic block model. Moreover, we obtain\nthe bifurcations of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model on the mean stochastic block\nmodel with asymmetric blocks and we show numerically the existence of periphery\nchimera state on the two-star graph. This allows us to highlight the critical\nrole played by the asymmetry of community sizes on the existence of chimera\nstates.

Most of the research on network\nresilience has focused on the transition from one equilibrium state to an\nalternative equilibrium state. Although the presence of non-equilibrium\ndynamics in some nodes may advance or delay sudden transitions in networks and\ngive early warning signals of an impending collapse, it has not been studied\nmuch in the context of network resilience. Here we bridge this gap by studying\na neuronal network model with diverse topologies, in which non-equilibrium\ndynamics may appear in the network even before the transition to a resting\nstate from an active state in response to environmental stress deteriorating\ntheir external conditions. We find that the percentage of uncoupled nodes\nexhibiting non-equilibrium dynamics plays a vital role in determining the\nnetwork's transition type. We show that a higher proportion of nodes with\nnon-equilibrium dynamics can delay the tipping and increase networks'\nresilience against environmental stress, irrespective of their topology.\nFurther, predictability of an upcoming transition weakens, as the network\ntopology moves from regular to disordered.\n",

For example, a phase model of two oscillators has a\none-dimensional differential equation for the evolution of the phase\ndifference. The existence of fixed points determines frequency-locking\nsolutions. By treating each oscillator as a black-box possessing a single input\nand a single output, one can investigate various control algorithms to change\nthe synchronization of the oscillators. In particular, we are interested in a\ndelayed feedback control algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the\noscillators after a subsequent phase reduction should give the same phase model\nas in the control-free case, but with a rescaled coupling strength. The\nconventional delayed feedback control is limited to the change of magnitude but\ndoes not allow the change of sign of the coupling strength. In this work, we\npresent a modification of the delayed feedback algorithm supplemented by an\nadditional unstable degree of freedom, which is able to change the sign of the\ncoupling strength. Various numerical calculations performed with Landau-Stuart\nand FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators show successful switching between an in-phase\nand anti-phase synchronization using the provided control algorithm.\nAdditionally, we show that the control force becomes non-invasive if our\nobjective is stabilization of an unstable phase difference for two coupled\noscillators.\n",

Simplicial complexes are therefore the mathematical\nobjects providing a faithful representation of such systems. We here present a\ncomplete theory of synchronization of $D$-dimensional oscillators obeying an\nextended Kuramoto model, and interacting by means of 1- and 2- simplices. Not\nonly our theory fully describes and unveils the intimate reasons and mechanisms\nfor what was observed so far with pairwise interactions, but it also offers\npredictions for a series of rich and novel behaviors in simplicial structures,\nwhich include: a) a discontinuous de-synchronization transition at positive\nvalues of the coupling strength for all dimensions, b) an extra discontinuous\ntransition at zero coupling for all odd dimensions, and c) the occurrence of\npartially synchronized states at $D=2$ (and all odd $D$) even for negative\nvalues of the coupling strength, a feature which is inherently prohibited with\npairwise-interactions. Furthermore, our theory untangles several aspects of the\nemergent behavior: the system can never fully synchronize from disorder, and is\ncharacterized by an extreme multi-stability, in that the asymptotic stationary\nsynchronized states depend always on the initial conditions. All our\ntheoretical predictions are fully corroborated by extensive numerical\nsimulations. Our results elucidate the dramatic and novel effects that\nhigher-order interactions may induce in the collective dynamics of ensembles of\ncoupled $D$-dimensional oscillators, and can therefore be of value and interest\nfor the understanding of many phenomena observed in nature, like for instance\nthe swarming and/or flocking processes unfolding in three or more dimensions.\n",

While\nan individual directly influences only a few neighbors, over time indirect\ninfluences penetrate a much larger group. The abiding question is how this\nspread of influence comes to affect the collective. One or a few individuals\nare often identified as leaders, being more influential than others. Transfer\nentropy and time-delayed mutual information are used to identify underlying\nasymmetric interactions, such as leader-follower classification in aggregated\nindividuals--cells, birds, fish, and animals. However, these conflate distinct\nfunctional modes of information flow between individuals. Computing information\nmeasures conditioning on multiple agents requires the proper sampling of a\nprobability distribution whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of\nagents being conditioned on. Employing simple models of interacting\nself-propelled particles, we examine the pitfalls of using time-delayed mutual\ninformation and transfer entropy to quantify the strength of influence from a\nleader to a follower. Surprisingly, one must be wary of these pitfalls even for\ntwo interacting particles. As an alternative we decompose transfer entropy and\ntime-delayed mutual information into intrinsic, shared, and synergistic modes\nof information flow. The result not only properly reveals the underlying\neffective interactions, but also facilitates a more detailed diagnosis of how\nindividual interactions lead to collective behavior. This exposes the role of\nindividual and group memory in collective behaviors. In addition, we\ndemonstrate in a multi-agent system how knowledge of the decomposed information\nmodes between a single pair of agents reveals the nature of many-body\ninteractions without conditioning on additional agents.\n",

Here we present a concept for spiking neural networks that are\ncapable of (re)configurable computation by choosing k via one global system\nparameter.

All previous studies on\nSISR in neural systems have only considered the idealized Gaussian white noise.\nMoreover, these studies have ignored one electrophysiological aspect of the\nnerve cell: its memristive properties. In this paper, first, we show that in\nthe excitable regime, the asymptotic matching of the Levy timescale (that\nfollows a power law, unlike Gaussian noise that follows Kramers law) and the\ndeterministic timescale (controlled by the singular parameter) can also induce\na strong SISR. In addition, it is shown that the degree of SISR induced by Levy\nnoise is not always higher than that of Gaussian noise. Second, we show that,\nfor both types of noises, the two memristive properties of the neuron have\nopposite effects on the degree of SISR: the stronger the feedback gain\nparameter that controls the modulation of the membrane potential with the\nmagnetic flux and the weaker the feedback gain parameter that controls the\nsaturation of the magnetic flux, the higher the degree of SISR. Finally, we\nshow that, for both types of noises, the degree of SISR in the memristive\nneuron is always higher than in the non-memristive neuron.

        "summary": "  The behavior at bifurcation from global synchronization to partial\nsynchronization in finite networks of coupled oscillators is a complex\nphenomenon, involving the intricate dynamics of one or more oscillators with\nthe remaining synchronized oscillators. This is not captured well by standard\nmacroscopic model reduction techniques which capture only the collective\nbehavior of synchronized oscillators in the thermodynamic limit. We introduce\ntwo mesoscopic model reductions for finite sparse networks of coupled\noscillators to quantitatively capture the dynamics close to bifurcation from\nglobal to partial synchronization. Our model reduction builds upon the method\nof collective coordinates. We first show that standard collective coordinate\nreduction has difficulties capturing this bifurcation. We identify a particular\ntopological structure at bifurcation consisting of a main synchronized cluster,\nthe oscillator that desynchronizes at bifurcation, and an intermediary node\nconnecting them. Utilizing this structure and ensemble averages we derive an\nanalytic expression for the mismatch between the true bifurcation from global\nto partial synchronization and its estimate calculated via the collective\ncoordinate approach. This allows to calibrate the standard collective\ncoordinate approach without prior knowledge of which node will desynchronize.\nWe introduce a second mesoscopic reduction, utilizing the same particular\ntopological structure, which allows for a quantitative dynamical description of\nthe phases near bifurcation. The mesoscopic reductions significantly reduce the\ncomputational complexity of the collective coordinate approach, reducing from\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. We perform numerical simulations for\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks and for modified Barab\\'asi-Albert networks\ndemonstrating excellent quantitative agreement at and close to bifurcation.\n",

One of the standard theoretical methods for analyzing\nsynchronization dynamics of oscillatory systems is the phase reduction for\nweakly perturbed limit-cycle oscillators, which allows us to simplify nonlinear\ndynamical models exhibiting stable limit-cycle oscillations to a simple\none-dimensional phase equation. Recently, the classical phase reduction method\nhas been generalized to infinite-dimensional oscillatory systems such as\nspatially extended systems and time-delayed systems, and also to include\namplitude degrees of freedom representing deviations of the system state from\nthe unperturbed limit cycle. In this chapter, we discuss the method of\nphase-amplitude reduction for spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems\nexhibiting stable oscillatory patterns.

The chimera pattern appears in chaotic\nrotational motion of the three junctions when two junctions evolve coherently\nwhile the third junction is incoherent. For larger repulsive coupling, the\njunctions evolves into another chimera pattern in a periodic state when two\njunctions remain coherent in rotational motion and one transits to incoherent\nlibrational motion.

The chimera patterns are detected by using\npartial and global error functions of the junctions while the librational and\nrotational motions are identified by a libration index.

        "summary": "  A system consisting of a doubly clamped beam with an attached body (slider)\nfree to move along the beam has been studied recently by multiple research\ngroups. Under harmonic base excitation, the system has the capacity to\npassively adapt itself (by slowly changing the slider position) to yield either\nhigh or low vibrations. The central contributions of this work are the\nrefinement of the recently developed system model with regard to the finite\nstiffness of the beam's clamping, followed by a thorough validation of this\nmodel against experimental results. With the intent to achieve repeatable and\nrobust self-adaption, a new prototype of the system was designed, featuring, in\nparticular, a continuously adjustable gap size and a concave inner contact\ngeometry. The initial beam model is updated based on the results of an\nExperimental Nonlinear Modal Analysis of the system (without slider). By\nvarying the excitation level and frequency in a wide range, all known types of\nbehavior were reproduced in the experiment. The simulation results of the\nupdated model with slider are in excellent agreement with the measurements,\nboth qualitatively (type of behavior) and quantitatively. Minor deviations are\nattributed to the system's sensitivity to inevitable uncertainties, in\nparticular with regard to the friction coefficient and the linear natural\nfrequency. It is thus concluded that the proposed model is well-suited for\nfurther analysis of its intriguing dynamics and for model-based optimization\nfor technical applications such as energy harvesting.\n",

We focus on the role of time correlations in the\nfluctuating power production and propose a new method for implementing colored\nnoise that reproduces non-Gaussian data by means of cumulants of data increment\ndistributions. Our desynchronization events are caused by overloads. We extend\nknown and propose different methods of dimensional reduction to considerably\nreduce the high-dimensional phase space and to predict the rare\ndesynchronization events with reasonable computational costs. The first method\nsplits the system into two areas, connected by heavily loaded lines, and treats\neach area as a single node. The second method considers a separation of the\ntimescales of power fluctuations and phase angle dynamics and completely\ndisregards the latter. The fact that this separation turns out to be justified,\nalbeit only to exponential accuracy in the strength of fluctuations, means that\nthe number of rare events does not sensitively depend on inertia or damping for\nrealistic heterogeneous parameters and long correlation times. Neither does the\nnumber of desynchronization events automatically increase with non-Gaussian\nfluctuations in the power production as one might have expected. On the other\nhand, the analytical expressions for the average time to desynchronization\ndepend sensitively on the finite correlation time of the fluctuating power\ninput.\n",

        "summary": "  Mass extinction is a phenomenon in the history of life on Earth when a\nconsiderable number of species go extinct over a relatively short period of\ntime. The magnitude of extinction varies between the events, the most well\nknown are the ``Big Five'' when more than one half of all species got extinct.\nThere were many extinctions with a smaller magnitude too. It is widely believed\nthat the common trigger leading to a mass extinction is a climate change such a\nglobal warming or global cooling. There are, however, many open questions with\nregard to the effect and potential importance of specific factors and\nprocesses. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical model that takes into\naccount two factors largely overlooked in the mass extinctions literature,\nnamely, (i) the active feedback of phytoplankton to the climate through\nchanging the albedo of the ocean surface and (ii) the species's adaptive\nevolutionary response to a climate change. We show that whether species goes\nextinct or not depends on a subtle interplay between the scale of the climate\nchange and the rate of the evolutionary response. We also show that species's\nresponse to a fast climate change can exhibit long transient dynamics (false\nextinction) when the species population density remain at a low value for a\nlong time before recovering to its safe steady state value. Finally, we show\nthat the distribution of extinction frequencies predicted by our model is\ngenerally consistent with the fossil record.\n",

Among the different\nsolutions, vibration energy harvesting has played a major role due to the\nalmost universal presence of mechanical vibrations: from ground shaking to\nhuman movements, from ambient sound to thermal noise. Standard approaches are\nmainly based on resonant linear oscillators that are acted on by ambient\nvibrations. Here we propose a new method based on the exploitation of the\ndynamical features of stochastic nonlinear oscillators. Such a method is shown\nto outperform standard linear oscillators and to overcome some of the most\nsevere limitations of present approaches, like narrow bandwidth, need for\ncontinuous frequency tuning and low efficiency. We demonstrate the superior\nperformances of this method by applying it to piezoelectric energy harvesting\nfrom ambient vibration. Experimental results from a toy-model oscillator are\ndescribed in terms of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. We prove that the method\nproposed here is quite general in principle and could be applied to a wide\nclass of nonlinear oscillators and different energy conversion principles.\nThere are also potentials for realizing micro/nano-scale power generators.\n",

The expression for the critical coupling can be\nstraightforwardly extended to a generalized explicit formula analytically, and\ns self-consistency approach is developed to predict the stationary states in\nthe thermodynamic limit. The landau damping effect is further revealed by means\nof the linear stability analysis and resonance poles theory above the critical\nthreshold which turns to be far more generic.

Perturbation from such spatially\nprepared initial condition leads to the existence of imperfectly synchronized\nstates. An imperfectly synchronized state represents the existence of solitary\noscillators which escape from the synchronized group in population-I and\nsynchronized oscillations in population-II. Also the existence of chimera state\nis independent of the increase of frequency mismatch between the populations.\nWe also find the coexistence of different dynamical states with respect to\ndifferent initial conditions which causes multistability in the globally\ncoupled system.

Recent work has\nshown that surprisingly, temporal networks can enjoy tremendous control\nadvantages over their static counterparts despite the fact that in temporal\nnetworks such paths are seldom instantaneously available. To understand the\nunderlying reasons, here we systematically analyze the scaling behavior of a\nkey control cost for temporal networks--the control energy. We show that the\nenergy costs of controlling temporal networks are determined solely by the\nspectral properties of an \"effective\" Gramian matrix, analogous to the static\nnetwork case. Surprisingly, we find that this scaling is largely dictated by\nthe first and the last network snapshot in the temporal sequence, independent\nof the number of intervening snapshots, the initial and final states, and the\nnumber of driver nodes. Our results uncover the intrinsic laws governing why\nand when temporal networks save considerable control energy over their static\ncounterparts.\n",

The few available large-scale experiments on humans\nhave however missed these effects. The reason is that, while models assume that\nindividuals update strategy by imitating better performing neighbors,\nexperiments showed that humans are more prone to reciprocate cooperation than\nto compare payoffs. Inspired by the empirical results, we rethink network\nreciprocity as a rational form of direct reciprocity on networks--networked\nrational reciprocity--indeed made possible by the locality of interactions.

We study the Fokker-Planck equation describing the\nsinusoidally forced dynamics of a noisy supercritical or subcritical Hopf\noscillator. To distinguish an oscillator's motion owing to sinusoidal forcing\nfrom that provoked by noise, we employ the phase-locked amplitude and vector\nstrength, which are zero in the absence of an external signal.

Strikingly, this simple model is already capable of explaining\nemergence of network spikes and bursts in developing neuronal cultures.

We found that topological modules do not contain\npurely anamotical groups or functional classes, and that stimulating different\nclasses of neurons lead to very different responses, measured in terms of\nsynchronization and phase velocity correlations. In all cases the modular\nstructure hindered full synchronization, protecting the system from seizures.\nThe responses to stimuli applied to topological and functional modules showed\npronounced patterns of correlation or anti-correlation with other modules that\nwere not observed when the stimulus was applied to a ganglion with mixed\nfunctional neurons.\n",

In this paper we explore the conditions for an optimal control\nof cascading failures in a system of interdependent networks. Specifically, we\nstudy the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model incorporating a control mechanism,\nwhich affects the frequency of cascades occurring in individual layers. This\nmodification allows us to explore sandpile-like dynamics near the critical\nstate, with supercritical region corresponding to infrequent large cascades and\nsubcritical zone being characterized by frequent small avalanches. Topological\ncoupling between networks introduces dependence of control settings adopted in\nrespective layers, causing the control strategy of a given layer to be\ninfluenced by choices made in other connected networks. We find that the\noptimal control strategy for a layer operating in a supercritical regime is to\nbe coupled to a layer operating in a subcritical zone, since such condition\ncorresponds to reduced probability of inflicted avalanches. However this\ncondition describes a parasitic relation, in which only one layer benefits.\nSecond optimal configuration is a mutualistic one, where both layers adopt the\nsame control strategy. This work demonstrates that control protocols in systems\nof interdependent networks need to take into account higher-order organization\nof the system and cannot be designed independently, maximizing benefits only\nfor their individual layers.\n",

Encoded within the system's\nstability matrix, the Jacobian, the answer is obscured by the scale and\ndiversity of the relevant systems, their broad parameter space, and their\nnonlinear interaction mechanisms. To make advances, here we uncover emergent\npatterns in the structure of the Jacobian, rooted in the interplay between the\nnetwork topology and the system's intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. These patterns\nhelp us analytically identify the few relevant control parameters that\ndetermine a system's dynamic stability. Complex systems, we find, exhibit\ndiscrete stability classes, from asymptotically unstable, where stability is\nunattainable, to sensitive, in which stability abides within a bounded range of\nthe system's parameters. Most crucially, alongside these two classes, we\nuncover a third class, asymptotically stable, in which a sufficiently large and\nheterogeneous network acquires a guaranteed stability, independent of\nparameters, and therefore insensitive to external perturbation.

Rev.\nE 102, 012404 (2020)] to enable us to elucidate the interaction domain among\ninteracting elements solely from an ensemble of trajectories. There, only pairs\nof elements whose distances are shorter than some distance variable, termed\ncutoff distance, are taken into account in the computation of transfer\nentropies. The prediction performance in capturing the underlying interaction\ndomain is subject to noise level exerted on the elements and the sufficiency of\nstatistics of the interaction events. In this paper, the dependence of the\nprediction performance is scrutinized systematically on noise level and the\nlength of trajectories by using a modified Vicsek model. The larger the noise\nlevel and the shorter the time length of trajectories, the more the derivative\nof average transfer entropy fluctuates, which makes it difficult to identify\nthe interaction domain in terms of the position of global minimum of the\nderivative of average transfer entropy. A measure to quantify the degree of\nstrong convexity at coarse-grained level is proposed. It is shown that the\nconvexity score scheme can identify the interaction distance fairly well even\nwhile the position of global minimum of the derivative of average transfer\nentropy does not.

This thermoacoustic\ninstability may lead to the disintegration of rocket engines, gas turbines and\naeroengines, so it is necessary to design control measures for its suppression.\nIt was speculated that such unwanted instability states may be dodged by\nchanging quickly enough the bifurcation parameters. Thus, in this work, based\non a fundamental mathematical model of thermoacoustic systems driven by colored\nnoise, the corresponding Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation of the amplitude is\nderived by using a stochastic averaging method.

Many studies have gained key\ninsights into this question by studying the classic Kuramoto oscillator model\non static networks. However, new questions arise when network structure is\ntime-varying or when the oscillator system is multistable, the latter of which\ncan occur when an inertial term is added to the Kuramoto model. While the\nconsequences of evolving topology and multistability on collective behavior\nhave been examined separately, real-world systems such as gene regulatory\nnetworks and the brain can exhibit these properties simultaneously. How does\nthe rewiring of network connectivity affect synchronization in systems with\nmultistability, where different paths of network evolution may differentially\nimpact system dynamics? To address this question, we study the effects of\ntime-evolving network topology on coupled Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. We\nshow that hysteretic synchronization behavior occurs when the network density\nof coupled inertial oscillators is slowly varied as the dynamics evolve.\nMoreover, we find that certain fixed-density rewiring schemes induce\nsignificant changes to the level of global synchrony, and that these changes\nremain after the network returns to its initial configuration and are robust to\na wide range of network perturbations. Our findings suggest that the specific\nprogression of network topology, in addition to its initial or final static\nstructure, can play a considerable role in modulating the collective behavior\nof systems evolving on complex networks.\n",

Increasing the heterogeneity, using the standard deviation of\nthe Hopf bifurcation parameter, favors the macroscopic oscillatory state for\nlow values of the symmetry breaking coupling and inhomogeneous steady state for\nlarger values of the coupling. There is also a transition, tipping, to\nhomogeneous steady state (aging state) from the macroscopic oscillatory state.\nThe limiting factor in the diffusive coupling favors the macroscopic\noscillatory state even in the presence of a large fraction of inactive\noscillators in the network thereby increasing the robustness of the network.\nThe globally coupled oscillators are reduced to a system of two evolution\nequations for the macroscopic order parameters, corresponding to the mean-field\nand the shape parameter, using the self-consistent field approach. The\nbifurcation diagrams obtained from the mean-field variables elucidate various\nbifurcation scenarios responsible for the dynamical transitions observed in N\nglobally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. In particular, tipping to the aging\nstate is found to occur via the Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations illustrating\nthe phenomenon of bifurcation induced tipping. Analytical stability (critical)\ncurves of these bifurcations, deduced from the mean-field variables, are found\nto fairly well agree with the simulation results.\n",

This is\ntypically accomplished by deriving coarse variables that summarize the\ncollective dynamics, these may take the form of either a collection of scalars\nor continuous fields (e.g. densities), which are then used as part of a reduced\nmodel. Analytically identifying such simplified models is challenging and has\ntraditionally been accomplished through the use of mean-field reductions or an\nOtt-Antonsen ansatz, but is often impossible.\n  Here we present a data-driven coarse-graining methodology for discovering\nsuch reduced models. We consider two types of reduced models: globally-based\nmodels which use global information and predict dynamics using information from\nthe whole ensemble, and locally-based models that use local information, that\nis, information from just a subset of agents close (close in heterogeneity\nspace, not physical space) to an agent, to predict the dynamics of an agent.\nFor both approaches we are able to learn laws governing the behavior of the\nreduced system on the low-dimensional manifold directly from time series of\nstates from the agent-based system. A nontrivial conclusion is that the\ndynamics can be equally well reproduced by an all-to-all coupled as well as by\na locally coupled model of the same agents.\n",

To study how\ncorrelation affects phase coherence, we analyzed the TFTC model by means of\nnumerical simulations and exact dimensional reduction methods allowing to study\nthe collective dynamics in terms of local order parameters. The competition\nresulting from distributed coupling strengths and natural frequencies produces\nnontrivial dynamic states. For correlated disorder in frequencies and coupling\nstrengths, we found that the entire oscillator population splits into two\nsubpopulations, both phase-locked (Lock-Lock) or one phase-locked, and the\nother drifting (Lock-Drift), where the mean-fields of the sub-populations\nmaintain a constant non-zero phase difference. For uncorrelated disorder, we\nfound that the oscillator population may split into four phase-locked\nsubpopulations, forming phase-locked pairs which are either mutually\nfrequency-locked (Stable Lock-Lock-Lock-Lock) or drifting (Breathing\nLock-Lock-Lock-Lock), thus resulting in a periodic motion of the global\nsynchronization level. Finally, we found for both types of disorder that a\nstate of Incoherence exists; however, for correlated coupling strengths and\nfrequencies, incoherence is always unstable, whereas it is only neutrally\nstable for the uncorrelated case.

First, we elucidate how the Kuramoto order parameter of the finite\nsized globally coupled two-population network of phase oscillators is connected\nto that of the continuum limit. These findings suggest that it is suitable to\nclassify the chimera states according to their order parameter dynamics, and\ntherefore we define Poisson and Non-Poisson chimera states. We then perform a\nLyapunov analysis of these two types of chimera states which yields insight\ninto the full stability properties of the chimera trajectories as well as of\ncollective modes. In particular, our analysis also confirms that Poisson\nchimeras are neutrally stable. We then introduce two types of \"perturbation\"\nthat act as small heterogeneities and render Poisson chimeras attracting: A\ntopological variation via the simplest nonlocal intra-population coupling that\nkeeps the network symmetries, and the allowance of amplitude variations in the\nglobally coupled two-population network, i.e., we replace the phase oscillators\nby Stuart-Landau oscillators.

We propose that the spreaders can be\nselected by imposing optimal perturbation on the equilibrium solution for the\nsubgraph consisting of the target nodes and their multi-step nearest neighbors\nwhile avoiding such perturbation on the complement graph that excludes target\nnodes from the original network. We further introduce a metric, termed targeted\ncollective influence, for each node to identify influential spreaders for\ntargeted spreading processes. The proposed method, validated in both synthetic\nand real-world networks, outperforms other competing heuristic approaches. Our\nresults provide a framework for analyzing the targeted influence maximization\nproblem and a practical method to identify spreaders in real-world\napplications.\n",

We consider the smallest possible network composed of four phase\noscillators and elucidate the phase space structure, (partial) integrability\nfor some parameter values, and how the bifurcations away from full symmetry\nlead to frequency-unlocked weak chimera solutions. Since such solutions wind\naround a torus they must arise in a global bifurcation scenario. Moreover,\nperiodic weak chimeras undergo a period doubling cascade leading to chaos.

We\ndiscover that depending upon the time period and duty cycle of the ON-OFF\nintervals, the aging region shrinks drastically in the parameter space,\ntherefore promoting restoration of oscillatory dynamics from the aging. In the\ncase of symmetric discrete coupling (where the ON-OFF intervals are equal), the\naging zone decreases significantly with the resumption of dynamism with an\nincreasing time period of the ON-OFF intervals. On the other hand, in the case\nof asymmetric coupling (where the ON-OFF intervals are not equal), we find that\nthe ratio of the ON and OFF intervals controls the aging dynamics: the aging\nstate is revoked more effectively if the interval of the OFF state is greater\nthan the ON state. Finally, we study the transition in aging using a discrete\npulse coupling: we note that the pulse interval plays a crucial role in\ndetermining the aging region. For all the cases of discrete time-dependent\ncouplings, the aging regions are shrinking and the rhythmicity gets enhanced in\na controlled manner.

Primarily, we\ninvestigate the dynamical transitions in the absence of perturbation,\ndemonstrating that the transition from desynchronized state to cluster\noscillatory state occurs through an interesting partial synchronization state.\nFollowed by this, the system dynamics transits to amplitude death and\noscillation death states. Importantly, we find that the observed dynamical\nstates do not preserve the parity(P) symmetry in the absence of perturbation.\nWhen the perturbation is increased one can note that the system dynamics\nexhibits a new kind of transition which corresponds to a change from incoherent\nmixed synchronization to coherent mixed synchronization through chimera state.\nIn particular, incoherent mixed synchronization and coherent mixed\nsynchronization states completely preserve the P-symmetry, whereas the chimera\nstate preserves the P-symmetry only partially. To demonstrate the occurrence of\nsuch partial symmetry breaking (chimera) state, we use basin stability analysis\nand discover that PSB exists as a result of the coexistence of symmetry\npreserving and symmetry breaking behavior in the initial state space. Further,\na measure of the strength of P-symmetry is established to quantify the\nP-symmetry in the observed dynamical states.

Since\nit is often impossible to prevent every risk, the focus is on adapting and\nmanaging risks in ways that minimize impacts to communities (e.g., humans and\nother systems). Several resilience strategies have been proposed in the\nliterature to reduce disaster risk and improve community resilience. Generally,\nresilience assessment is challenging due to uncertainty and unavailability of\ndata necessary for the estimation process.

The methodology is based on the\nPEOPLES framework, an indicator-based hierarchical framework that defines all\naspects of the community. A fuzzy-based approach is implemented to quantify the\nPEOPLES indicators using descriptive knowledge instead of hard data, accounting\nalso for the uncertainties involved in the analysis. To demonstrate the\napplicability of the methodology, data regarding the functionality of the city\nSan Francisco before and after the Loma Prieta earthquake are used to obtain a\nresilience index of the Physical Infrastructure dimension of the PEOPLES\nframework. The results show that the methodology can provide good estimates of\ncommunity resilience despite the uncertainty of the indicators.

In practice, however, this limit is\nfully accessible only if the Ott-Antonsen theory can be applied, and the\nheterogeneity is distributed following a rational function. In this work we\ndemonstrate the usefulness of a moment-based scheme to reproduce the dynamics\nof infinitely many oscillators. Our analysis is particularized for Gaussian\nheterogeneities, leading to a FourierHermite decomposition of the oscillator\ndensity. The Fourier-Hermite moments obey a set of hierarchical ordinary\ndifferential equations. As a preliminary experiment, the effects of truncating\nthe moment system and implementing different closures are tested in the\nanalytically solvable Kuramoto model. The moment-based approach proves to be\nmuch more efficient than the direct simulation of a large oscillator ensemble.\nThe convenience of the moment-based approach is exploited in two illustrative\nexamples: (i) the Kuramoto model with bimodal frequency distribution, and (ii)\nthe 'enlarged Kuramoto model' (endowed with nonpairwise interactions). In both\nsystems we obtain new results inaccessible through direct numerical integration\nof populations.\n",

However, the fabrication of slow artificial oscillators at micrometre\nscales remains a major roadblock towards the development of fully-autonomous\nmicrorobots.

Similar, though much less studied characteristic, is the amplitude\nresponse that can be defined either using an ad hoc approach to amplitude\nestimation or via the isostable variables.

Although PRC determination for noise-free neuronal-like\noscillators perturbed by narrow pulses is a well-known task, the general case\nremains a challenging problem. Even more challenging is the inference of the\namplitude response. This characteristic is crucial, e.g., for controlling the\namplitude of the collective mode in a network of interacting units -- a task\nrelevant to neuroscience.

Even the highest resolution achieved with ultrafast lasers driving\ntwo-photon polymerization barely reaches 100 nm, three orders of magnitude\ndistant from the atomic scale. Here, we adopt a long-term view when we ask\nabout the possibility of a 3D atom printer, which can build an arbitrarily\nshaped object of macroscopic dimensions with control over its atomic structure\nat room temperature. After discussing the state-of-the-art technology based on\ndirect laser writing, we identify three fundamental challenges. The first is\nthe fat fingers problem, i.e., laser wavelengths are much larger than the size\nof the atoms. The second one is complexity explosion; namely, the number of\nprocessing steps scales with the inverse cube of the resolution, leading to\nprohibitively long processing times. The third challenge is the increasing\nstrength of random fluctuations as we approach the atomic scale. This requires\ncontrol over the fluctuations, which we call mischief of fluctuations. Although\ndirect-writing techniques offer sufficient resolution, speed, and excellent\nflexibility for the mesoscopic scale, each of the three fundamental problems\nappears enough to render the atomic scale unreachable. In contrast, these three\nchallenges are not fundamental limitations to self-organisation. We propose a\npotential path to a 3D atom printer, where laser-driven self-organisation can\ncomplement direct-writing techniques by bridging the atomic and mesoscopic\nscales.\n",

Here, we describe a nontrivial type of twisted state in a\nsystem of nonlocally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. The nontrivial twisted\nstate (NTS) is a coherent traveling wave characterized by inhomogeneous\nprofiles of amplitudes and phase gradients, which can be assigned a winding\nnumber. To further investigate its properties, several methods are employed. We\nperform a linear stability analysis in the continuum limit and compare the\nresults with Lyapunov exponents obtained in a finite-size system. The\ndetermination of covariant Lyapunov vectors allows us to identify collective\nmodes. Furthermore, we show that the NTS is robust to small heterogeneities in\nthe natural frequencies and present a bifurcation analysis revealing that NTSs\nare born/annihilated in a saddle-node bifurcation and change their stability in\nHopf bifurcations. We observe stable NTSs with winding number 1 and 2. The\nlatter can lose stability in a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, leading to a\nmodulated 2-NTS.\n",

Many of these\nsystems have a network organization that should be taken into account to\nunderstand the underlying processes in detail. In the present paper, we\ntheoretically explore an extension of the SOB concept on the scale-free network\nunder coupling constraints. As provided by the numerical simulations and\nmean-field approximation in the thermodynamic limit, SOB on scale-free networks\noriginates from facilitated criticality reflected on both macro- and mesoscopic\nnetwork scales. We establish that the appearance of switches is rooted in\nspatial self-organization and temporal self-similarity of the network's\ncritical dynamics and replicates extreme properties of epileptic seizure\nrecurrences.

We model a facet of intelligence, viz. memory, where\nthe agents remember how well they were able to travel in their desired\ndirections and make up for their non-optimal past.

When memory is short\nterm, the local rearrangement of the agents lead to the formation of\nsymmetrically jammed arrangements, which take longer to unjam. However, when\nagents remember across longer time-scales, we find that the dynamics of an\nagent becomes sensitive to the relatively small differences in the history of\nthe nearby agents.

Various numerical examples are\nprovided, which demonstrate emergent behaviors similar to the ``fingering''\nphenomenon observed in some phototaxis and chemotaxis experiments; this\nphenomenon is generally known as a challenging pattern to capture for existing\nmodels. The novel pairwise interactions provides a fundamental mechanism by\nwhich agents may form social hierarchy across a wide range of biological\nsystems.\n",

This paper aims to clarify the coupling effects on the\ndynamics, power, and thermal efficiency of a pair of weakly coupled LTD\nStirling engines and formulate the maximum thermal efficiency of the coupled\nsystem in the quasilinear response regime. We show that the dependence relation\nbetween the effective frequency difference and the coupling strength is\ncharacterized by a hysteresis, which comes from different kinds of bifurcations\nin the process of increasing and decreasing the value of the coupling strength.\nThen, by generalizing thermodynamic fluxes and forces and their quasilinear\nrelations for engines under weak coupling, we show that the coupling improves\nthe power exerted against the load torques and the thermal efficiency. We\nfurther show that their maximum values are achieved when the engines are\nsynchronized. Since the thermal efficiency depends on the frequency difference,\nthe dependence of thermal efficiency on the coupling strength is also\ncharacterized by a hysteresis. Finally, the load torque that achieves the\nmaximum thermal efficiency of the coupled system is formulated.\n",

In this paper, the three most prominent classical\nevolutionary strategies Lamarckian, Darwinian, and Baldwinian are implemented\nand compared in an agent-based simulation. The dynamics of optimization and\nlearning are studied in constant as well as in dynamic environments, both as\nsingle evolutionary strategy populations and as mixed evolutionary strategy\npopulations. The three different agent types are implemented as simple objects\nthat need to gather resources to replicate. The agent fitness is defined\nthrough a bitstring match between the agent and the environment and to\nreplicate each agent needs to gather sufficient resources. To make a fair\ncomparison between the three different evolutionary methods, we can assume that\nboth the ability to learn within an individual's lifetime and the learning\nprocess itself require additional resources compared to an evolutionary process\nwithout lifetime learning. When all three strategies coexist and we vary the\nreplication costs for the different strategies we find the following general\npattern: The evolutionary advantage decreases for Lamarckian and Baldwinian\nstrategies as their learning costs increase and/or as their relative\nreplication costs increase compared to the Darwinian strategies, and in most\nsituations the Baldwinian strategy performs in between the Darwinian and\nLamarckian strategies. Finally, as our investigations emphasize the superiority\nof the Lamarckian strategy in most cases with low learning cost, it is\ninteresting to note that a corresponding biological inheritance mechanism did\nnot evolve, while the Lamarckian strategy is currently extensively used in\ntechnology applications.\n",

The considered network is hybrid one,\ntherefore Mikheev approach is applied to transform it to the network with\ntime-varying delayed couplings. Thus the problem of hybrid network\nsynchronization is reduced to the studying of synchronization in networks with\ndelayed couplings, which was previously solved by analytical means. It is\nshowed that the Laplace matrix spectrum and maximum sampling interval are\ndefining for networks dynamics. The dynamics of 5 neural mass model populations\nwith discrete couplings was simulated for 3 different situations. The first\ncase deal with the asymptotic synchronization, when both maximum eigenvalue of\nLaplacian and maximum sampling interval are small enough. The second case is\nabout e-synchronization, which is achieved for small enough maximum eigenvalue\nof Laplacian and big sampling intervals. And the last case is desynchronization\nof oscillations, which has been observed for big values of Laplacian\neigenvalues and sampling intervals.\n",

In this Letter, we present yet another novel form of chimera, which\nwe refer to as self-induced-stochastic-resonance breathing chimera (SISR-BC),\nwhich differs fundamentally from the CRC in that it combines the mechanism and\neffects of self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR, previously shown in [Phys.\nRev. E 72, 031105 (2005)] to be intrinsically different from CR), the symmetry\nbreaking in the rotational coupling between the slow and fast subsystems of the\ncoupled oscillators, and the property of breathing chimera -- a form of chimera\nstate characterized by non-stationary periodic dynamics of coherent-incoherent\npatterns with a periodically oscillating global order parameter. Unlike other\ntypes of chimeras, including CRC, SISR-BC demonstrates remarkable resilience to\na relatively wide range of stochastic perturbations and persists even when the\npurely excitable system is significantly distant from the Hopf bifurcation\nthreshold -- thanks to the mechanism of SISR -- and globally attract random\ndistributions of initial conditions. Considering its potential impact on\ninformation processing in neuronal networks, SISR-BC could have special\nsignificance and applications.\n",

In this work, a circuit of a ring rhythm generator\nwas created from several (from two to eight) FitzHugh--Nagumo electronic\noscillators with electronic synapses (sigmoid coupling function and delay were\nimplemented). Oscillatory modes were shown to be possible in this circuit as a\nresult of collective dynamics, with the frequency being controlled by means of\na delay in the synapse and/or changing the number of elements in the ring. For\nsome parameter values, there were multistability modes, when the implementation\nof a specific oscillatory regime was determined by initial conditions or could\nbe achieved by a short-term external driving.

        "summary": "  Synchronization and desynchronization are the two ends on the spectrum of\nemergent phenomena that somehow often coexist in biological, neuronal, and\nphysical networks. However, previous studies essentially regard their\ncoexistence as a partition of the network units: those that are in relative\nsynchrony and those that are not. In real-world systems, desynchrony bears\nsubtler divisions because the interacting units are high-dimensional, like fish\nschooling with varying speeds in a circle, synchrony and desynchrony may occur\nto the different dimensions of the population. In this work, we show with an\nensemble of multidimensional Kuramoto oscillators, that this property is\ngeneralizable to arbitrary dimensions: for a $d$ dimensional population, there\nexist $2^d$ system modes where each dimension is either synchronized or\ndesynchronized, represented by a set of almost binary order parameters. Such\nphenomena are induced by a matrix coupling mechanism that goes beyond the\nconventional scalar-valued coupling by capturing the inter-dimensional\ndependence amongst multidimensional individuals, which arises naturally from\nphysical, sociological and engineering systems. As verified by our theory, the\nproperty of the coupling matrix thoroughly affects the emergent system modes\nand the phase transitions toward them. By numerically demonstrating that these\nsystem modes are interchangeable through matrix manipulation, we also observe\nexplosive synchronization/desynchronization that is induced without the\nconditions that are previously deemed essential. Our discovery provides\ntheoretical analogy to the cerebral activity where the resting state and the\nactivated state coexist unihemispherically, it also evokes a new possibility of\ninformation storage in oscillatory neural networks.\n",

Managing the SNF requires the use of system-level\nanalysis software that considers waste generation, on-site (centralized\nstorage), transportation infrastructure, and long-term disposal. The Next\nGeneration System Analysis Model is an agent-based model that was developed to\nsimulate the transportation and storage of SNF and HLW. NGSAM has the\ncapability to detail the interaction and movement of individual components and\ngroups, such as rail cars and casks. The SNF inventory from commercial nuclear\nreactors is currently in temporary storage at multiple locations spread across\nthe US. Shipping of SNF from these locations relies on one of three\ntransportation modes: rail, heavy-haul truck, or barge. Rail is the most\npreferred due to the size of the canisters and casks the SNF would be shipped\nin. Under some scenarios, a rail route might not be available to a reactor site\nor improving the rail infrastructure at shutdown sites might be too\ncost-prohibitive for utilities to opt for a direct rail transfer. Under such\nscenarios, using a barge or heavy haul truck to de-inventory the site and\ntransfer the SNF to a nearby intermodal transfer site with adequate rail\ninfrastructure where the payload could be transferred to a rail car might prove\nto be an attractive option. This work presents the various intermodal\ntransportation options to move SNF from reactor sites to rail cars. Next, the\noperational steps in each of these modes to move the SNF from a reactor site\nand transfer it to a rail car is explored. The ideology, assumptions, and\nfuture steps are presented.\n",

The species' abundance variables represented by the nodes in\nthe model networks follow generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics and input signals\nare incorporated at appropriate driver nodes to control the \\textit{Lantana\ncamara} outgrowth. Analysis with Lie algebra and controllability criteria\nshowed that our model systems are controllable with minimum of two control\ninput signals. Analytical results of our model equations indicated that\nsuccessive interventions are required to increase the abundance of\ncontrol-plant, the microbes and suppress \\textit{Lantana camara}. We observed\nfrom the numerical analysis with LQR algorithm that the number of interventions\nto be taken to control the \\textit{Lantana camara} outgrowth depends on the\nchoice of various important parameters such as intervention time, effort and\npenalty etc. Further, the increase in nonlinear terms contributed from\nself-loops in the network model shows the persistence of \\textit{L. camara} and\nhow it drives the coexistence of the species.

Here, we find that when oscillators with two-simplex\ninteraction alone are subjected to external noise, synchrony is eroded and\neventually completely disappears even when the noise is infinitesimally weak.\nNonetheless, synchronized states may persist for extended periods, with the\nlifetime increasing approximately exponentially with the strength of the\ntwo-simplex interaction. Assuming weak noise and using Kramers' rate theory, we\nderive a closed dynamical equation for the Kuramoto order parameter, by which\nthe exponential dependence is derived. Further, when sufficiently strong\none-simplex coupling is additionally introduced, noise erosion is prevented and\nsynchronized states become persistent. The bifurcation analysis of the\ndesynchronized state reveals that as one-simplex coupling increases, the\nsynchronized state appears supercritically or subscritically depending on the\nstrength of two-simplex coupling.

This paper explores cooperation evolution in populations\nwith weak and strong players, using a game model where players choose between\ncooperation and defection. Asymmetry stems from different benefits for strong\nand weak cooperators, with their benefit ratio indicating the degree of\nasymmetry. Varied rankings of parameters including the asymmetry degree,\ncooperation costs, and benefits brought by weak players give rise to scenarios\nincluding the prisoner's dilemma (PDG) for both player types, the snowdrift\ngame (SDG), and mixed PDG-SDG interactions. Our results indicate that in an\ninfinite well-mixed population, defection remains the dominant strategy when\nstrong players engage in the prisoner's dilemma game. However, if strong\nplayers play snowdrift games, global cooperation increases with the proportion\nof strong players. In this scenario, strong cooperators can prevail over strong\ndefectors when the proportion of strong players is low, but the prevalence of\ncooperation among strong players decreases as their proportion increases. In\ncontrast, within a square lattice, the optimum global cooperation emerges at\nintermediate proportions of strong players with moderate degrees of asymmetry.\nAdditionally, weak players protect cooperative clusters from exploitation by\nstrong defectors.

Notable examples are the\nfrequency and amplitude chimeras, chimera death states, solitary states as well\nas combinations of these. In a previous study [Journal of Physics: Complexity,\n2020, 1(2), 025006], a toy model was introduced addressing possible mechanisms\nbehind the formation of frequency chimera states. In the present study a\nvariation of the toy model is proposed to address the formation of amplitude\nchimeras. The proposed oscillatory model is now equipped with an additional 3rd\norder equation modulating the amplitude of the network oscillators. This way,\nthe single oscillators are constructed as bistable in amplitude and depending\non the initial conditions their amplitude may result in one of the two stable\nfixed points. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when these oscillators are\nnonlocally coupled in networks, they organize in domains with alternating\namplitudes (related to the two fixed points), naturally forming amplitude\nchimeras. A second extension of this model incorporates nonlinear terms merging\namplitude together with frequency, and this extension allows for the\nspontaneous production of composite amplitude-and-frequency chimeras occurring\nsimultaneously in the network. Moreover the extended model allows to understand\nthe emergence of bump states via the continuous passage from chimera states,\nwhen both fixed point amplitudes are positive, to bump states when one of the\ntwo fixed points vanishes. The proposed mechanisms of creating domains with\nvariable amplitudes and/or frequencies provide a generic scenario for\nunderstanding the formation of the complex synchronization phenomena observed\nin networks of coupled nonlinear and chaotic oscillators.\n",

Despite decades of empirical work using multifractal formalisms, a\nfundamental question has persisted: Do the observed nonlinear interactions\nacross scales owe their origin to multiplicative interactions, or do they\ninherently reside within the constituent processes? This study presents the\nresults of rigorous numerical simulations that demonstrate the supremacy of\nmultiplicative interactions over the intrinsic nonlinear properties of\ncomponent processes. To elucidate this point, we conducted simulations of\ncascade time series featuring component processes operating at distinct\ntimescales, each characterized by one of four properties: multifractal\nnonlinearity, multifractal linearity (obtained via the Iterative Amplitude\nAdjusted Wavelet Transform of multifractal nonlinearity), phase-randomized\nlinearity (obtained via the Iterative Amplitude Adjustment Fourier Transform),\nand phase- and amplitude-randomized (obtained via shuffling). Our findings\nunequivocally establish that the multiplicative interactions among components,\nrather than the inherent properties of the component processes themselves,\ndecisively dictate the multifractal emergent properties. Remarkably, even\ncomponent processes exhibiting purely linear traits can generate nonlinear\ninteractions across scales when these interactions assume a multiplicative\nnature. In stark contrast, additivity among component processes inevitably\nleads to a linear outcome. These outcomes provide a robust theoretical\nunderpinning for current interpretations of multifractal nonlinearity, firmly\nanchoring its roots in the domain of multiplicative interactions across scales\nwithin biological and psychological processes.\n",

Concretely, we articulate a view\non emergence based on how software works, which is rooted on a mathematical\nformalism that articulates how macroscopic processes can express self-contained\ninformational, interventional, and computational properties. This framework\nestablishes a hierarchy of nested self-contained processes that determines what\ncomputations take place at what level, which in turn delineates the functional\narchitecture of a complex system. This approach is illustrated on paradigmatic\nmodels from the statistical physics and computational neuroscience literature,\nwhich are shown to exhibit macroscopic processes that are akin to software in\nhuman-engineered systems. Overall, this framework enables a deeper\nunderstanding of the multi-level structure of complex systems, revealing\nspecific ways in which they can be efficiently simulated, predicted, and\ncontrolled.\n",

Recently, we have\nprovided an alternative description in which the slow dynamics result from a\nnon-hyperbolic and Lyapunov-unstable attracting sets from connected dynamical\nghosts that form a closed orbit (termed ghost cycles). Here we investigate the\nresponse properties of both type of systems to external forcing.

Phase plane analysis reveals that these features result from\nthe continuous remodeling of the attractor landscape of the ghost cycles models\ncharacteristic for non-autonomous systems, whereas the attractor landscape of\nthe corresponding slow-fast system remains qualitatively unaltered.

On the other hand, systems may possess multiple\nmetastable states, and ecological resilience is the ability to switch between\nthese states according to perturbations. Control strategies from these two\nresilience perspectives yield distinct outcomes. In fact, ecological resilience\noriented control has rarely been viewed in urban traffic, despite the fact that\ntraffic system is a complex system in highly uncertain environment with\npossible multiple metastable states. This absence highlights the necessity for\nurban traffic ecological resilience definition. To bridge this gap, we defines\nurban traffic ecological resilience as the ability to absorb uncertain\nperturbations by shifting to alternative states. The goal is to generate a\nsystem with greater adaptability, without necessarily returning to the original\nequilibrium. Our control framework comprises three aspects: portraying the\nrecoverable scopes; designing alternative steady states; and controlling system\nto shift to alternative steady states for adapting large disturbances. Among\nthem, the recoverable scopes are portrayed by attraction region; the\nalternative steady states are set close to the optimal state and outside the\nattraction region of the original equilibrium; the controller needs to ensure\nthe local stability of the alternative steady states, without changing the\ntrajectories inside the attraction region of the original equilibrium.\nComparisons with classical engineering resilience oriented urban traffic\nresilience control schemes show that, proposed ecological resilience oriented\ncontrol schemes can generate greater resilience.

We demonstrate the existence of a stable global\nsynchronous state, with a condition resembling the master stability function,\ncontingent on the choice of coupling functions. Our theoretical findings are\nsupported by simulations using Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal and R\\\"{o}ssler\noscillators. These simulations illustrate how synchronization is facilitated by\nhigher-order interactions, both within and across layers, highlighting the\nadvantages over scenarios involving interactions within single layers.\n",

The\nsecond model modifies the first and implements a simple rent control scheme.\nFor both models, we investigate the linear stability of equilibria and\nnumerically determine the characteristics of oscillatory solutions as a\nfunction of system parameters. Introducing a rent control scheme stabilizes the\nsystem, in the sense that the parameter regime under which solutions approach\nequilibrium is expanded. However, oscillatory time series generated by the rent\ncontrol model are generally more disorganized than those generated by the\nnon-rent control model; in fact, long-term transient chaos was observed under\ncertain conditions in the rent control case.

ISR was first experimentally verified with cerebellar Purkinje\nneurons. These experiments showed that ISR enables optimal information transfer\nbetween the input and output spike train of neurons. Subsequent studies\ndemonstrated the efficiency of information processing and transfer in neural\nnetworks with small-world topology. We conducted a numerical investigation into\nthe impact of adaptivity on ISR in a small-world network of noisy\nFitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons, operating in a bistable regime with a stable\nfixed point and a limit cycle -- a prerequisite for ISR. Our results show that\nthe degree of ISR is highly dependent on the FHN model's timescale separation\nparameter $\\epsilon$. The network structure undergoes dynamic adaptation via\nmechanisms of either spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) with\npotentiation-/depression-domination parameter $P$, or homeostatic structural\nplasticity (HSP) with rewiring frequency $F$. We demonstrate that both STDP and\nHSP amplify ISR when $\\epsilon$ lies within the bistability region of FHN\nneurons. Specifically, at larger values of $\\epsilon$ within the bistability\nregime, higher rewiring frequencies $F$ enhance ISR at intermediate (weak)\nsynaptic noise intensities, while values of $P$ consistent with\ndepression-domination (potentiation-domination) enhance (deteriorate) ISR.\nMoreover, although STDP and HSP parameters may jointly enhance ISR, $P$ has a\ngreater impact on ISR compared to $F$. Our findings inform future ISR\nenhancement strategies in noisy artificial neural circuits, aiming to optimize\ninformation transfer between input and output spike trains in neuromorphic\nsystems, and prompt venues for experiments in neural networks.\n",

The cost is the trade-off between the power\nrequired for pumping the fluid and the energy consumption for vessel\nmaintenance. The model has been used to show emergence of cyclic structures in\nthe presence of locally fluctuating demand, i.e. non-constant net flow at sink\nnodes. Under rapid and sufficiently large fluctuations, the dynamics exhibits\nbistability of tree-like and cyclic network structures. We compare these\nsolutions in terms of the cost functional E. Close to the saddle-node\nbifurcation giving rise to the cyclic solutions, we find a parameter regime\nwhere the tree-like solution rather than the cyclic solution is cost-optimal.\nThus we discover an additional, non-local transition where tree-like and cyclic\nsolutions exchange their roles as minimum-cost (or ground) states.

This comparison highlighted\ndistinct behaviors, including double hysteresis loops in the synchronization\nphase transition and standing waves for intralayer coupling at the locations of\nthe hysteresis loops, where the waves are composed of different interacting\nfrequencies.\n",

Their frequencies are locked such that for every $p$ cycles of one\noscillator there are $q$ cycles of the other. We demonstrate this phenomenon in\na pair of coupled neurons having \\textit{identical} frequencies but\n\\textit{asymmetric} coupling. Specifically, we focus on an\nexcitatory(E)-inhibitory(I) neuron pair where such an asymmetry is naturally\npresent even with equal reciprocal synaptic strengths $(g)$ and inverse time\nconstant $(\\alpha)$. We thoroughly investigate the asymmetric coupling-induced\n$p/q$ frequency locking structure in $(g,\\alpha)$ parameter space through\nsimulations and analysis. Simulations display quasiperiodicity, devil\nstaircase, a novel Farey arrangement of spike sequences, and presence of\nreducible and irreducible $p/q$ regions. We introduce an analytical method,\nbased on event-driven maps, to determine the existence and stability of any\nspike sequence of the two neurons in a $p/q$ frequency-locked state.\nSpecifically, this method successfully deals with non-smooth bifurcations and\nwe could utilize it to obtain solutions for the case of identical E-I neuron\npair under arbitrary coupling strength. In contrast to the so-called Arnold\ntongues, the $p/q$ regions obtained here are not structure-less. Instead they\nhave their own internal bifurcation structure with varying levels of\ncomplexity. Intra-sequence and inter-sequence multistability, involving spike\nsequences of same $p/q$ state, are found. Additionally, multistability also\narises by overlap of $p/q$ with $p'/q'$. The boundaries of both reducible and\nirreducible $p/q$ regions are defined by saddle node and non-smooth grazing\nbifurcations of various types.\n",

System-level\ngenetic codes differ from part-level genetic codes in which each discrete part\nis coded independently. In general, a system-level genetic code requires coding\ndiscrete interacting parts such as organs or proteins in an interdependent way.\nChanging a single symbol or \"gene\" in a system-level genetic code affects two\nor more parts in a coordinated way. System-level genetic codes provide a\nplausible mechanism for evolution by leaps also known as systemic\nmacromutations or hopeful monsters without invoking an intelligent agent,\nvitalistic forces, or new laws of physics. A system-level genetic code may\nexplain the rapid appearance of new forms of life in the fossil record such as\nthe Cambrian Explosion in which most invertebrate phyla appeared. A\nsystem-level genetic code may explain the origin of complex integrative systems\nof tightly coadapted proteins such as the blood coagulation cascade in which\nthe removal or structural modification of any single part breaks the system. It\nis demonstrated that a simple system-level genetic code can, in principle, be\nimplemented using biochemical mechanisms similar or identical to the mechanisms\nused by transposable elements, regulation of gene expression, and the adaptive\nvertebrate immune system. It is further suggested that cancer in the body and\nboth normal and tumor cell lines cultured in vitro are caused by mutations of\nthe system-level genetic code. An explanation why multi-cellular organisms\nretain the ability to revert to uni-cellularity and thus a tendency to develop\ncancer is presented.\n",

Ecolab, whilst not an artificial\nlife system, is a model of an evolving ecology that has advantages of\nmathematical tractability and computational simplicity. The Bedau statistics\nare well defined for Ecolab, and this paper reports statistics measured for\ntypical Ecolab runs, as a function of mutation rate. The behaviour ranges from\nclass 1 (when mutation is switched off), through class 3 at intermediate\nmutation rates (corresponding to scale free dynamics) to class 2 at high\nmutation rates. The class 3/class 2 transition corresponds to an error\nthreshold. Class 4 behaviour, which is typified by the Biosphere, is\ncharacterised by unbounded growth in diversity. It turns out that Ecolab is\ngoverned by an inverse relationship between diversity and connectivity, which\nalso seems likely of the Biosphere. In Ecolab, the mutation operator is\nconservative with respect to connectivity, which explains the boundedness of\ndiversity. The only way to get class 4 behaviour in Ecolab is to develop an\nevolutionary dynamics that reduces connectivity of time.\n",

The dynamics of\nparapatric speciation is modeled as a biased random walk with absorption\nperformed by the average genetic distance between the residents and immigrants.\nIf a small number of genetic changes is sufficient for complete reproductive\nisolation, mutation and random genetic drift alone can cause speciation on the\ntime scale of 10-1000 times the inverse of the mutation rate. Even relatively\nweak selection for local adaptation can dramatically decrease the waiting time\nto speciation. The duration of parapatric speciation is shorter by orders of\nmagnitude than the waiting time to speciation. For a wide range of parameter\nvalues, the duration of speciation is order one over the mutation rate.

Aids starts, like most diseases, in a peak of virus\nexpression (2,3), which is practically wiped out by the immune system. However\nit then remains in the body at a low level of expression until later (some time\nyears later) when there is an outbreak of the disease which terminally cripples\nthe immune system causing death from various common pathogens.

        "summary": "  \"Standard\" information theory says nothing about the semantic content of\ninformation. Nevertheless, applications such as evolutionary theory demand\nconsideration of precisely this aspect of information, a need that has\nmotivated a largely unsuccessful search for a suitable measure of an \"amount of\nmeaning\". This paper represents an attempt to move beyond this impasse, based\non the observation that the meaning of a message can only be understood\nrelative to its receiver. Positing that the semantic value of information is\nits usefulness in making an informed decision, we define pragmatic information\nas the information gain in the probability distributions of the receiver's\nactions, both before and after receipt of a message in some pre-defined\nensemble. We then prove rigorously that our definition is the only one that\nsatisfies obvious desiderata, such as the additivity of information from\nlogically independent messages. This definition, when applied to the\ninformation \"learned\" by the time evolution of a process, defies the intuitions\nof the few previous researchers thinking along these lines by being monotonic\nin the uncertainty that remains after receipt of the message, but non-monotonic\nin the Shannon entropy of the input ensemble. It then follows that the\npragmatic information of the genetic \"messages\" in an evolving population is a\nglobal Lyapunov function for Eigen's quasi-species model of biological\nevolution. A concluding section argues that a theory such as ours must\nexplicitly acknowledge purposeful action, or \"agency\", in such diverse fields\nas evolutionary theory and finance.\n",

One of the species $Y$ is assumed to have a slower synthesis\nspeed. Through divisions of the protocells, the system reaches and remains in a\nstate in which there are only a few active $Y$ and almost no inactive $Y$\nmolecules in most protocells, through selection of very rare fluctuations. In\nthis state, the active $Y$ molecules are shown to control the behavior of the\nprotocell. The minority molecule species act as the information carrier, due to\nthe relatively discrete nature of its population, in comparison with the\nmajority species which behaves statistically in accordance with the law of\nlarge numbers. The relevance of this minority controlled state to evolvability\nis discussed.\n",

RNA, proteins, or similar organic molecules polymerized in a\ndehydrated carbon-rich environment, on surfaces in a carbon-rich environment,\nor in another environment where polymerization occurs. These polymers\nsubsequently entered an aqueous environment where they folded into compact\nstructures. It is argued that the folding of randomly generated polymers such\nas RNA or proteins in water tends to partition the folded polymer into domains\nwith hydrophobic cores and matching shapes to minimize energy. In the aqueous\nenvironment, hydrolysis or other reactions fragmented the compact structures\ninto two or more matching molecules, occasionally producing simple living\nsystems, also known as autocatalytic sets of molecules. It is argued that the\nhydrolysis of folded polymers such as RNA or proteins is not random. The\nhydrophobic cores of the domains are rarely bisected due to the energy\nrequirements in water. Hydrolysis preferentially fragments the folded polymers\ninto pieces with complementary structures and chemical affinities. Thus the\nprobability of producing a system of matched, interacting molecules in\nprebiotic chemistry is much higher than usually estimated. Environments where\nthis process may occur are identified. For example, the jigsaw model suggests\nlife may have originated at a seep of carbonaceous fluids beneath the ocean.\nThe polymerization occurred beneath the sea floor. The folding and\nfragmentation occurred in the ocean. The implications of this hypothesis for\nseeking life or prebiotic chemistry in the Solar System are explored.\n",

An application to\nrock-scissors-paper game interactions shows that the collective learning\ndynamics exhibits a diversity of competitive and cooperative behaviors.

In these models, the dynamics of N elements, defined as Boolean\nvariables, develop step by step, clocked by a discrete time variable. Each of\nthe N Boolean elements at a given time is given a value which depends upon K\nelements in the previous time step.\n  We review the work of many authors on the behavior of the models, looking\nparticularly at the structure and lengths of their cycles, the sizes of their\nbasins of attraction, and the flow of information through the systems. In the\nlimit of infinite N, there is a phase transition between a chaotic and an\nordered phase, with a critical phase in between.\n  We argue that the behavior of this system depends significantly on the\ntopology of the network connections. If the elements are placed upon a lattice\nwith dimension d, the system shows correlations related to the standard\npercolation or directed percolation phase transition on such a lattice. On the\nother hand, a very different behavior is seen in the Kauffman net in which all\nspins are equally likely to be coupled to a given spin. In this situation,\ncoupling loops are mostly suppressed, and the behavior of the system is much\nmore like that of a mean field theory.\n  We also describe possible applications of the models to, for example, genetic\nnetworks, cell differentiation, evolution, democracy in social systems and\nneural networks.\n",

The huge amount\nof species found in nature demands a simple and robust mechanism. Yet, no\nconsensus has been reached concerning a reasonable disruptive selection\nmechanism that prevents mixing genes among the emerging species, especially\nwhen they live in sympatry. Usually it is assumed that females select males\naccording to their displaying traits, but males perform no selection on female\ntraits. However, recent experimental evidence accumulates towards the existence\nof male choice. Here we propose a robust mechanism for sympatric speciation,\nbased on the assumption that sexual selection operates in two directions:\nselection of males by females and of females by males. Complex mating\ninstabilities emerge, creating differential fitness depending on the\nindividuals displaying traits and preferences. When a secondary sexual trait is\nintroduced in a population, due to mutations, the activation of previously\nneutral genes or due to a different perception of already existent displaying\ntraits, sympatric speciation may result (together with a species recognition\nsystem) from a competitive exclusion principle. We suggest that potential\ncandidates to test our theory could be yeasts.\n",

In the former case, the mean field\napproximation exhibits cyclic behaviour with an amplitude determined by the\ninitial condition. When stochastic phenomena are taken into account the\namplitude of oscillations will drift and eventually one and then two of the\nthree species will become extinct. The second model remains stationary for all\ninitial conditions in the mean field approximation, and drifts when stochastic\nphenomena are considered. We analyzed the distribution of first extinction\ntimes of both models by simulations and from the point of view of the\nFokker-Planck equation. Survival probability vs. time plots suggest an\nexponential decay. For the neutral model the extinction rate is inversely\nproportional to the system size, while the cyclic model exhibits anomalous\nbehaviour for small system sizes. In the large system size limit the extinction\ntimes for both models will be the same. This result is compatible with the\nsmallest eigenvalue obtained from the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck\nequation. We also studied the long--time behaviour of the probability\ndistribution.

This\nrequires postulating a functional form for the potential, and also takes long\ntime. Here we instead seek a method for quickly obtaining an effective\npotential. ANTS, which has previously been used to obtain approximate solutions\nto various optimization problems, is well suited for this.

Another striking\nfeature of the nervous system is that spike based information transmission,\nwhich is supposed to be robust against noise, is noisy in itself: the variance\nof the spiking of the individual neurons is surprisingly large which may\ndeteriorate the adequate functioning of the Hebbian mechanisms. In this paper\nwe focus on networks in which Hebbian-like adaptation is induced only by\nexternal random noise and study spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity. We\nshow that such `HebbNets' are able to develop a broad range of network\nstructures, including scale-free small-world networks. The development of such\nnetwork structures may provide an explanation of the role of noise and its\ninterplay with Hebbian plasticity.

So it was with great surprise that I noted neutral mutations being very\nrare in a visualisation of phylogenetic trees generated in {\\em Tierra}, since\nI already knew that there was a significant amount of neutrality in the Tierra\ngenotype-phenotype map.

Our study takes place in a reduced phase space of\ncoarse-grained \"observables\" of the system: the first few moments of the\noscillator phase angle distribution. We circumvent the derivation of explicit\ndynamical equations (approximately) governing the evolution of these\ncoarse-grained macroscopic variables; instead we use the {\\it equation-free\nframework} [Kevrekidis {\\it et al.}, {\\it Comm. Math. Sci.} {\\bf 1}(4), 715\n(2003)] to computationally solve these equations without obtaining them in\nclosed form. In this approach, the numerical tasks for the conceptually\nexisting but unavailable coarse-grained equations are implemented through short\nbursts of appropriately initialized simulations of the \"fine-scale\", detailed\ncoupled oscillator model. Coarse projective integration and coarse fixed point\ncomputations are illustrated.\n",

We consider a discrete\nMarkov chain model. This model in some aspects is similar to well-known Ising\nmodel describing ferromagnetics. Namely we consider a set of N investors, each\nof whom has either bullish or bearish opinion, denoted by plus or minus\nrespectively. At every time step each of N investors can change his/her sign.\nThe probability of a plus becoming a minus and the probability of a minus\nbecoming a plus depends only on the bullish sentiment described as the number\nof bullish investors among the total of N investors. The number of bullish\ninvestors then forms a Markov chain whose transition matrix is calculated\nexplicitly. The transition matrix of that chain is ergodic and any initial\ndistribution of bullish investors converges to stationary. Stationary\ndistributions of bullish investors in this Markov chain model are similar to\ncontinuous distributions of the \"theory of social imitation\" of Callen and\nShapero. Distributions obtained this way can represent 3 types of market\nbehavior: one-peaked distribution that is close to Gaussian, transition market\n(flattening of the top), and two-peaked distribution.\n",

The model\npresented here shows that SOC can arise in non-conservative systems as well, if\ndriven internally. Evidence suggests that synaptic background activity provides\nthe internal drive for non-conservative cortical networks to achieve and\nmaintain a critical state. SOC is robust to any degree $\\eta \\in (0,1]$ of\nbackground activity when the network size $N$ is large enough such that $\\eta\nN\\sim 10^3$.

The average act\ndegree of neuroendocrine network is h = 3.01, It means each mediator is\nsecreted by three cells on an average . The similarity that stand for the\naverage probability of secreting the same mediators by all the neuroendocrine\ncells is s = 0.14.

The theory is developed as a\ngeneralization of the classical mean field approach to sandpile dynamics by\nformulating it as a generalization of Itoh's SDE. This equation contains a\nfractional Gaussian noise term representing the branching of an avalanche into\nsmall active clusters, and a drift term reflecting the tendency for small\navalanches to grow and large avalanches to be constricted by the finite system\nsize. If one defines avalanching to take place when the toppling activity\nexceeds a certain threshold the stochastic model allows us to compute the\navalanche exponents in the continum limit as functions of the Hurst exponent of\nthe noise. The results are found to agree well with numerical simulations in\nthe Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld and Zhang sandpile models.

Earlier network models typically assumed that\ntopological transformations are caused by exogenous factors, such as\npreferential attachment of new nodes and stochastic or targeted removal of\nexisting nodes. However, many real-world complex systems exhibit both of these\ntwo dynamics simultaneously, and they evolve largely autonomously based on the\nsystem's own states and topologies.

We show here that such a procedure does not\nnecessarily mean that the system exhibits self-organized criticality. We first\nprovide an analysis of multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings of\nbrain activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative LFP\npeaks can be close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not\nrobust to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous\nstatistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Similar power-law\nscaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that power-law scaling\nmay be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes. We next\ninvestigate this problem analytically, and show that, indeed, stochastic\nprocesses can produce spurious power-law scaling without the presence of\nunderlying self-organized criticality. However, this power-law is only apparent\nin logarithmic representations, and does not survive more rigorous analysis\nsuch as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The same analysis was also performed on an\nartificial network known to display self-organized criticality. In this case,\nboth the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal\nwith no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law. We\nconclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious power-law\nscaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon. This apparent\npower-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized criticality,\nwhich should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests.\n",

E 60, 5, 1999), in which the learning is outcome-related.\nEvery individual chooses between a pair of existing strategies or types, guided\nby a combination of two factors: tendency to conform to the local majority,\n\\em{and} a preference for the type with higher perceived success \\em{among its\nneighbors}, based on their relative outcomes. Here, an extension of the\n\\em{interfacial model} of Ref. 1 is proposed, in which individuals additionally\ntake into account their \\em{own} outcomes in arriving at their outcome-based\nchoices. Three possible update rules for handling bulk sites are considered.\nThe corresponding phase diagrams, obtained at coexistence, show systematic\ndepartures from the original interfacial model. Possible relationships of these\nvariants with the \\em{cooperative model} of Ref. 1 are also touched upon.\n",

A distributed control law is examined: the control action\non an individual vehicle depends on (i) its own velocity and (ii) the relative\nposition measurements with a small subset of vehicles (neighbors) in the\nformation. The neighbors are defined according to an information graph.\n  In this paper we describe a methodology for modeling, analysis, and\ndistributed control design of such vehicular formations whose information graph\nis a D-dimensional lattice. The modeling relies on an approximation based on a\npartial differential equation (PDE) that describes the spatio-temporal\nevolution of position errors in the formation. The analysis and control design\nis based on the PDE model. We deduce asymptotic formulae for the closed-loop\nstability margin (absolute value of the real part of the least stable\neigenvalue) of the controlled formation. The stability margin is shown to\napproach 0 as the number of vehicles N goes to infinity. The exponent on the\nscaling law for the stability margin is influenced by the dimension and the\nstructure of the information graph. We show that the scaling law can be\nimproved by employing a higher dimensional information graph.\n  Apart from analysis, the PDE model is used for a mistuning-based design of\ncontrol gains to maximize the stability margin. Mistuning here refers to small\nperturbation of control gains from their nominal symmetric values. We show that\nthe mistuned design can have a significantly better stability margin even with\na small amount of perturbation. The results of the analysis with the PDE model\nare corroborated with numerical computation of eigenvalues with the state-space\nmodel of the formation.\n",

If the complexity of such structures is interpreted as a\nmetaphor for the complexity of biological structures, we can conclude that this\nmodel has the potential to generate the complexity typical of living beings. It\ncan be shown how the model is able to reproduce a simplified version of key\nbiological phenomena such as development, the presence of \"junk DNA\", the\nphenomenon of ageing and the process of carcinogenesis. The model links\nproperties and behaviour of genes and cells to properties and behaviour of the\norganism, describing and interpreting the said phenomena with a unified\nframework: for this reason, we think it can be proposed as a model for all\nbiology. The material contained in this work is not new: the model and its\nimplications have all been described in previous works from a computer-science\npoint of view. This work has two objectives: 1) To present the whole theory in\nan organic and structured way and 2) To introduce Epigenetic Tracking from a\nbiological perspective. The work is divided into six parts: the first part is\nthe introduction; the second part describes the cellular model; the third part\nis dedicated to the evo-devo method and transposable-elements; the fourth part\ndeals with junk DNA and ageing; the fifth part explores the topic of cancer;\nthe sixth part draws the conclusions.\n",

To validate the models with field data, a case study was carried\nout in an industrial company. Furthermore, concepts and measures of complex\nsystems science are analyzed. To evaluate emergent complexity in NPD projects,\nan information-theory measure-termed \"effective measure complexity\" (EMC)- is\nchosen, because it can be derived from first principles and can be calculated\nefficiently. EMC measures the mutual information between the infinite past and\nfuture histories of a stochastic process. According to this principle, EMC is\nof particular interest for evaluating time-dependent complexity. The formulated\nVAR and HM models provide the base for the calculation of several closed-form\nsolutions of EMC, solutions that allow an explicit complexity assessment based\non the model's independent parameters. Finally, the theoretical complexity\nanalyses are elucidated in practical terms through an applied example of\noptimizing project organization design. The objective is to minimize emergent\ncomplexity by choosing the \"best\" team design from within a predefined group of\ndevelopers with different productivities in a simulated NPD project.

In\ncontrast, biological systems operate in a highly flexible manner; learn quickly\nadequate responses to novel conditions, and evolve new routines/traits to\nremain competitive under persistent environmental change. A recent theory on\nthe origins of biological flexibility has proposed that degeneracy - the\nexistence of multi-functional components with partially overlapping functions -\nis a primary determinant of the robustness and adaptability found in evolved\nsystems. While degeneracy's contribution to biological flexibility is well\ndocumented, there has been little investigation of degeneracy design principles\nfor achieving flexibility in systems engineering. Actually, the conditions that\ncan lead to degeneracy are routinely eliminated in engineering design.\n  With the planning of transportation vehicle fleets taken as a case study,\nthis paper reports evidence that degeneracy improves robustness and\nadaptability of a simulated fleet without incurring costs to efficiency. We\nfind degeneracy dramatically increases robustness of a fleet to unpredicted\nchanges in the environment while it also facilitates robustness to anticipated\nvariations. When we allow a fleet's architecture to be adapted in response to\nenvironmental change, we find degeneracy can be selectively acquired, leading\nto faster rates of design adaptation and ultimately to better designs. Given\nthe range of conditions where favorable short-term and long-term performance\noutcomes are observed, we propose that degeneracy design principles\nfundamentally alter the propensity for adaptation and may be useful within\nseveral engineering and planning contexts.\n",

One of the conditions for the SOC is the slow driving noise, which\nunambiguously suggests Stratonovich interpretation of the corresponding\nstochastic differential equation (SDE). This, in turn, necessitates the use of\nParisi-Sourlas-Wu stochastic quantization procedure, which straightforwardly\nleads to a model with BRST-exact action, i.e., to a W-TFT. In the parameter\nspace of the SDE, there must exist full-dimensional regions where the\nBRST-symmetry is spontaneously broken by instantons, which in the context of\nSOC are essentially avalanches. In these regions, the avalanche-type SOC\ndynamics is liberated from overwise a rightful dynamics-less W-TFT, and a\nGoldstone mode of Fadeev-Popov ghosts exists. Goldstinos represent modulii of\ninstantons (avalanches) and being gapless are responsible for the critical\navalanche distribution in the low-energy, long-wavelength limit. The above\narguments are robust against moderate variations of the SDE's parameters and\nthe criticality is \"self-tuned\". The proposition of this paper suggests that\nthe machinery of W-TFTs may find its applications in many different areas of\nmodern science studying various physical realizations of SOC. It also suggests\nthat there may in principle exist a connection between some of SOC's and the\nconcept of topological quantum computing.\n",

Common to both regions, agricultural subsistence\nprofited from the introduction of major staple crops which had been\ndomesticated elsewhere; in both regions, the temperate climate and originally\npredominant forest vegetation provided an environmental context conducive to\nagriculture. To understand the different paths to agricultural subsistence, an\nintegrated view of technological innovation, domestication and exchange of\ndomesticates, migration and trade is required within the constraints imposed by\nthe environmental context and geography. This study makes use of a numerical\nmodel of regional socio-technological evolution which builds on adaptation of\nimportant characteristics of prehistoric societies such as technology and\nsubsistence diversity. With this Global Land Use and Technological Evolution\nSimulator (GLUES), regional transitions from foraging to agropastoralism, and\nassociated land use and demographic changes are realistically hindcasted. I\nshow that the model is capable of explaining the different timing, speed, and\ntransition mechanisms: Europe received a large package of foreign domesticates\nand converted rapidly to agriculture, this fast transition can be best\nexplained with demic and cultural diffusion followed by fast adoption by\nresident foragers. In contrast, ENA trajectories show a more gradual\ntransition.

We study\na class of critical routing models, equivalent to random maps, which can be\nsolved rigorously in the thermodynamic limit. The information flow is conserved\nfor these routing models and governed by cyclic attractors. We consider two\nclasses of information flow, Markovian routing without memory and vertex\nrouting involving a one-step routing memory. Investigating the respective cycle\nlength distributions for complete graphs we find log corrections to power-law\nscaling for the mean cycle length, as a function of the number of vertices, and\na sub-polynomial growth for the overall number of cycles.\n  When observing experimentally a real-world dynamical system one normally\nsamples stochastically its phase space. The number and the length of the\nattractors are then weighted by the size of their respective basins of\nattraction. This situation is equivalent to `on the fly' generation of routing\ntables for which we find power law scaling for the weighted average length of\nattractors, for both conserved routing models. These results show that critical\ndynamical systems are generically not scale-invariant, but may show power-law\nscaling when sampled stochastically. It is hence important to distinguish\nbetween intrinsic properties of a critical dynamical system and its behavior\nthat one would observe when randomly probing its phase space.\n",

Then, well known conditions for lumpability make it possible to\nestablish the cases where the macro model is still Markov. In this case we\nobtain a complete picture of the dynamics including the transient stage, the\nmost interesting phase in applications. For such a purpose a crucial role is\nplayed by the type of probability distribution used to implement the stochastic\npart of the model which defines the updating rule and governs the dynamics.

We consider a D-dimensional lattice\nas information graph, of which the 1-D platoon is a special case. The stability\nmargin is measured by the real part of the least stable eigenvalue of the\nclosed-loop state matrix, which quantifies the rate of decay of initial errors.\nIn [1], it was shown that with symmetric control, in which two neighbors put\nequal weight on information received from each other, the stability margin of a\n1-D vehicular platoon decays to 0 as O(1/N^2), where N is the number of\nvehicles. Moreover, a perturbation analysis was used to show that with\nvanishingly small amount of asymmetry in the control gains, the stability\nmargin scaling can be improved to O(1/N). In this paper, we show that, with\njudicious choice of non-vanishing asymmetry in control, the stability margin of\nthe closed loop can be bounded away from zero uniformly in N. Asymmetry in\ncontrol gains thus makes the control architecture highly scalable. The results\nare also generalized to D-dimensional lattice information graphs that were\nstudied in [2], and the correspondingly stronger conclusions than those derived\nin [2] are obtained. In addition, we show that the size-independent stability\nmargin can be achieved with relative position and relative velocity (RPRV)\nfeedback as well as relative position and absolute velocity (RPAV) feedback,\nwhile the analysis in [1], [2] was only for the RPAV case.\n",

Surprisingly, in the presence of noise synchronous\noscillations generated by an electrically coupled network may differ\nqualitatively from the oscillations produced by uncoupled individual cells\nforming the network. A prominent example of such behavior is the synchronized\nbursting in islets of Langerhans formed by pancreatic \\beta-cells, which in\nisolation are known to exhibit irregular spiking. At the heart of this\nintriguing phenomenon lies denoising, a remarkable ability of electrical\ncoupling to diminish the effects of noise acting on individual cells.\n  In this paper, we derive quantitative estimates characterizing denoising in\nelectrically coupled networks of conductance-based models of square wave\nbursting cells. Our analysis reveals the interplay of the intrinsic properties\nof the individual cells and network topology and their respective contributions\nto this important effect. In particular, we show that networks on graphs with\nlarge algebraic connectivity or small total effective resistance are better\nequipped for implementing denoising. As a by-product of the analysis of\ndenoising, we analytically estimate the rate with which trajectories converge\nto the synchronization subspace and the stability of the latter to random\nperturbations. These estimates reveal the role of the network topology in\nsynchronization. The analysis is complemented by numerical simulations of\nelectrically coupled conductance-based networks.

In such\nsystems, users arrive at a station, take a bike and use it for a while, then\nreturn it to another station of their choice. Each station has a finite\ncapacity: it cannot host more bikes than its capacity. We propose a stochastic\nmodel of an homogeneous bike-sharing system and study the effect of users\nrandom choices on the number of problematic stations, i.e., stations that, at a\ngiven time, have no bikes available or no available spots for bikes to be\nreturned to. We quantify the influence of the station capacities, and we\ncompute the fleet size that is optimal in terms of minimizing the proportion of\nproblematic stations. Even in a homogeneous city, the system exhibits a poor\nperformance: the minimal proportion of problematic stations is of the order of\n(but not lower than) the inverse of the capacity. We show that simple\nincentives, such as suggesting users to return to the least loaded station\namong two stations, improve the situation by an exponential factor. We also\ncompute the rate at which bikes have to be redistributed by trucks to insure a\ngiven quality of service. This rate is of the order of the inverse of the\nstation capacity. For all cases considered, the fleet size that corresponds to\nthe best performance is half of the total number of spots plus a few more, the\nvalue of the few more can be computed in closed-form as a function of the\nsystem parameters.

We also demonstrate conditions under which, as the flock size\nincreases, the interior density in our equilibria tends to an approximately\nuniform value. Motivated by observations of starling flocks that are relatively\nthin in a direction transverse to the direction of flight, we investigate the\nstability of infinite, planar-sheet flock equilibria. We find that long-\nwavelength perturbations along the sheet are unstable for the class of models\nthat we investigate. This has the conjectured consequence that sheet-like\nflocks of arbitrarily large transverse extent relative to their thickness do\nnot occur. However, we also show that our model admits approximately\nsheet-like, 'pancake-shaped', three-dimensional ellipsoidal equilibria with\ndefinite aspect ratios (transverse length- scale to flock thickness) determined\nby anisotropic perceptual/response characteristics of the flocking individuals,\nand we argue that these pancake-like equilibria are stable to the previously\nmentioned sheet instability.\n",

We analytically and\nnumerically analyse virus dynamics and humoral response in a host during\nprimary and secondary dengue infection for long periods using micro-epidemic\nmodels. The models presented here incorporate time delays, antibody dependent\nenhancement (ADE), a dynamic switch and a correlation factor between different\nDENV serotypes.

For\nprimary infection, the stability analysis of steady states shows interesting\ndependence on the time delay involved in the production of antibodies from\nplasma cells. We demonstrate the existence of a critical value for the immune\nresponse parameter, beyond which the infection gets completely cured. For\nsecondary infections with a different serotype, the homologous antibody\nproduction is enhanced due to the influence of heterologous antibodies. The\nantibody production is also controlled by the correlation factor, which is a\nmeasure of similarities between the different DENV serotypes involved.

We\nrevisit the commons approach to unlicensed spectrum and try to show that a\ncommons can be basically regulated from the inside out. GT simulations of CR\ninteractions reveal the emergence of certain equilibria mirroring\nbehaviours/trends?. Once these ?trends identified, norms may be expressed and\nthen embedded into machines (CRs). Internalized norms may thus become the\nalternative to external enforcement of rules. We call these emerging norms\ntechno-social norms (TSNs). TSNs could eventually become a means of regulating\nthe use of unlicensed spectrum and making open spectrum access feasible. Open\nspectrum access scenarios are considered and analysis is performed based on\nreformulations of two game theoretical models: Cournot and Bertrand. The\nstandard oligopoly models are reformulated in terms of radio resource access in\nunlicensed bands. In order to capture the large variety of CR interaction\nsituations, several GT equilibrium concepts are considered: Nash, Pareto,\nBerge-Zhukovskii, and Lorenz. In order to capture the heterogeneity of CR\ninteractions, the standard GT model is enriched allowing players to be biased\ntoward different types of equilibrium (or rationality). An evolutionary\ngame-equilibrium detection method is used. Numerical simulations bring relevant\ninsights on the problem of autonomy vs. regulation in emerging CR environments.\nRelying on extensive GT simulations, some rules of behaviour - to be expanded\ninto techno-social norms - may be derived.\n",

The\nunique informational narrative of living systems suggests that life may be\ncharacterized by context-dependent causal influences, and in particular, that\ntop-down (or downward) causation -- where higher-levels influence and constrain\nthe dynamics of lower-levels in organizational hierarchies -- may be a major\ncontributor to the hierarchal structure of living systems. Here we propose that\nthe origin of life may correspond to a physical transition associated with a\nshift in causal structure, where information gains direct, and\ncontext-dependent causal efficacy over the matter it is instantiated in. Such a\ntransition may be akin to more traditional physical transitions (e.g.\nthermodynamic phase transitions), with the crucial distinction that determining\nwhich phase (non-life or life) a given system is in requires dynamical\ninformation and therefore can only be inferred by identifying causal\narchitecture. We discuss some potential novel research directions based on this\nhypothesis, including potential measures of such a transition that may be\namenable to laboratory study, and how the proposed mechanism corresponds to the\nonset of the unique mode of (algorithmic) information processing characteristic\nof living systems.\n",

The\nexternal representation in the context of this paper refers to the city itself,\nexternal to human minds, while the internal representation concerns how the\ncity is represented in human minds internally. This paper deals with the first\nissue, i.e., what trait the city has that make it imageable? We develop an\nargument that the image of the city arises from the underlying scaling of city\nartifacts or locations. This scaling refers to the fact that, in an imageable\ncity (a city that can easily be imaged in human minds), small city artifacts\nare far more common than large ones; or alternatively low dense locations are\nfar more common than high dense locations. The sizes of city artifacts in a\nrank-size plot exhibit a heavy tailed distribution consisting of the head,\nwhich is composed of a minority of unique artifacts (vital and very important),\nand the tail, which is composed of redundant other artifacts (trivial and less\nimportant). Eventually, those extremely unique and vital artifacts in the top\nhead, i.e., what Lynch called city elements, make up the image of the city. We\nargue that the ever-increasing amount of geographic information on cities, in\nparticular obtained from social media such as Flickr and Twitter, can turn\nresearch on the image of the city, or cognitive mapping in general, into a\nquantitative manner. The scaling property might be formulated as a law of\ngeography.\n  Keywords: Scaling of geographic space, face of the city, cognitive maps,\npower law, and heavy tailed distributions.\n",

Autonomous\ndynamics involving sequences of transiently stable states have been termed\nassociative latching in the context of grammar generation. We propose that\ngenerating functionals allow for a systematic construction of dynamical\nnetworks with well characterized dynamical behavior, such as regular or\nintermittent bursting latching dynamics.\n  Coupling local, slowly adapting variables to an attractor network allows to\ndestabilize all attractors, turning them into attractor ruins. The resulting\nattractor relict network may show ongoing autonomous latching dynamics. We\npropose to use two generating functionals for the construction of attractor\nrelict networks. The first functional is a simple Hopfield energy functional,\nknown to generate a neural attractor network. The second generating functional,\nwhich we denote polyhomeostatic optimization, is based on\ninformation-theoretical principles, encoding the information content of the\nneural firing statistics. Polyhomeostatic optimization destabilizes the\nattractors of the Hopfield network inducing latching dynamics.\n  We investigate the influence of stress, in terms of conflicting optimization\ntargets, on the resulting dynamics. Objective function stress is absent when\nthe target level for the mean of neural activities is identical for the two\ngenerating functionals and the resulting latching dynamics is then found to be\nregular. Objective function stress is present when the respective target\nactivity levels differ, inducing intermittent bursting latching dynamics.

Although diseases may go extinct due\nto random loss of effective contacts where the infection is transmitted to new\nsusceptible individuals, the time to extinction in the absence of control may\nbe prohibitively long. Thus intervention controls, such as vaccination of\nsusceptible individuals and/or treatment of infectives, are typically based on\na deterministic schedule, such as periodically vaccinating susceptible children\nbased on school calendars. In reality, however, such policies are administered\nas a random process, while still possessing a mean period.

We show explicitly how intervention control, based on mean\nperiod and treatment fraction, modulates the average extinction times as a\nfunction of population size and rate of infection spread. In particular, our\nresults show an exponential improvement in extinction times even though the\ncontrols are implemented using a random Poisson distribution. Finally, we\ndiscover those parameter regimes where random treatment yields an exponential\nimprovement in extinction times over the application of strictly periodic\nintervention.

This beauty is a new type of aesthetic at\na deeper structural level, and differs in essence from an intuitive sense of\nharmony, perceived in terms of color, shape, texture, and ratio. This new kind\nof beauty was initially defined and discovered by Christopher Alexander, and\npromoted in his master work The Nature of Order. To paraphrase Mandelbrot, this\nis the beauty for the sake of science rather than for art's sake or for the\nsake of commerce. Throughout the paper, we attempt to argue and illustrate that\nthe scaling of geographic space possesses this new kind of beauty, which has a\npositive impact on human well-being. The paper further draws upon the previous\nwork of Nikos Salingaros and Richard Taylor on the beauty in architecture and\narts to support our argument.\n  Keywords: Aesthetics, heavy-tailed distributions, head/tail breaks, Zipf's\nlaw, and fractals\n",

The chemistry\ncontains a large number of spontaneous reactions of which a small subset could\nbe catalyzed by molecules produced in the chemistry with varying catalytic\nstrengths. We show ACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the\nresources of the system into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a\nbistability in the population dynamics and, in particular, steady states\nwherein the ACS molecules dominate the population, i.e., have higher\nconcentrations compared to the rest of molecules in the chemistry (background).\nIn this thesis we attempt to address two main questions: First, under what\ncircumstances do molecules belonging to the ACSs dominate over the background,\nand second, starting from an initial condition that does not contain good\ncatalysts, can a sparse set of large molecules (containing several tens or a\nfew hundred monomers) that are good catalysts arise and be maintained in the\nsystem at concentrations significantly above the background? We show that if an\nACS catalyzed by large molecules contains within it (or partially overlaps\nwith) a smaller ACS catalyzed by smaller molecules (referred to as a `nested\nACS' structure), the catalytic strength required for the large ACS to dominate\ncomes down significantly. We show that when the network contains a cascade of\nnested ACSs with the catalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with\ntheir size, a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules\ncan come to dominate the system.\n",

We demonstrate consistency of the general principles of\ncompetition with thermodynamic description, review and analyse the related\nentropy concepts and introduce the corresponding competitive H-theorem. A\ncompetitive system can be characterised by a thermodynamic quantity -\ncompetitive potential --- which determines the likely direction of evolution of\nthe system. Contested resources tend to move between systems from lower to\nhigher values of the competitive potential. There is, however, an important\ndifference between conventional thermodynamics and competitive thermodynamics.\nWhile conventional thermodynamics is constrained by its zeroth law and is\nfundamentally transitive, the transitivity of competitive thermodynamics\ndepends on the transitivity of the competition rules. Intransitivities are\ncommon in the real world and are responsible for complex behaviour in\ncompetitive systems.\n  This work follows the ideas and methods that are originated in analysis of\nturbulent combustion but reviews a much broader scope of issues linked to\nmixing and competition, including thermodynamic characterisation of complex\ncompetitive systems with self-organisation.

The covalent bonding of atoms in organic\npigments provides excited levels compatible with the energies of these photons.\nInternal conversion through vibrational relaxation to the ground state of these\nexcited molecules when in water leads to rapid dissipation of the solar photons\ninto heat, and this is the major source of entropy production on Earth.

In principle\ncollective stochastic coherence and synchronizability are incompatible\nphenomena, since strongly synchronized elements behave identically and thus\ntheir response to noise is indistinguishable to that of a single element.\nTherefore one can expect systems that synchronize well to have a poor\ncollective response to noise. Here we show that, in spite of this apparent\nconflict, a certain coupling architecture is able to reconcile the two\nproperties. Specifically, our results reveal that weighted scale-free networks\nof diffusively coupled excitable elements exhibit both high synchronizability\nof their subthreshold dynamics and a good collective response to noise of their\npulsed dynamics. This is established by comparing the behavior of this system\nto that of random, regular, and unweighted scale-free networks.

The\ngoverning equations are an asymptotically reduced set of equations that are\nderived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are\napplicable for rapidly rotating flow regimes and are best suited to describe\nanisotropic dynamics of rotating flows. The independent variables of these\nequations inherently reside in a helical wave basis that is the most suitable\nbasis for inertial waves. A coupled system of equations for the two global\ninvariants: \\textit{energy} and \\textit{helicity}, is derived by extending a\nsimpler symmetrical system to the more general non-symmetrical helical case.\nThis approach of deriving the kinetic equations for helicity follows naturally\nby exploiting the symmetries in the system and is different from the\nderivations presented in earlier work of \\citet{Galtier03, Galtier14} that uses\nmultiple correlation functions to account for the asymmetry due to helicity.\nStationary solutions, including Kolmogorov solutions, for the flow invariants\nare obtained as a scaling law of the anisotropic wave numbers. The scaling law\nsolutions compare affirmatively with results from recent experimental and\nsimulation data. The theory developed in this paper pertains to the wave\ndynamics supported by an asymptotically reduced set of hydrodynamic equations\nand therefore encompasses a different dynamical regime compared to the weak\nturbulence theory presented in the work of \\citet{Galtier03, Galtier14}.\n",

More specifically, we generated a triangulated irregular\nnetwork, made up of individual unique user locations, and then categorized\nsmall triangles (smaller than an average) as natural cities for the United\nStates (mainland) on a monthly basis. The concept of natural cities provides a\npowerful means to develop new insights into the evolution of real cities,\nbecause there are virtually no data available to track the history of cities\nacross their entire life spans and at very fine spatial and temporal scales.\nTherefore, natural cities can act as a good proxy of real cities, in the sense\nof understanding underlying interactions, at a global level, rather than of\npredicting cities, at an individual level. Apart from the data produced and the\ncontributed methods, we established new insights into the structure and\ndynamics of natural cities, e.g., the idea that natural cities evolve in\nnonlinear manners at both spatial and temporal dimensions.\n  Keywords: Big data, head/tail breaks, ht-index, power laws, fractal, and\nnonlinearity\n",

This paper does not deal with the\nlatter issue with respect to why, and instead investigates whether Zipf's law\nholds in a global setting, thus involving all cities around the world. Unlike\nprevious studies, which have mainly relied on conventional census data such as\npopulations, and census-bureau-imposed definitions of cities, we adopt\nnaturally (in terms of data speaks for itself) delineated cities, or natural\ncities, to be more precise, in order to examine Zipf's law. We find that Zipf's\nlaw holds remarkably well for all natural cities at the global level, and\nremains almost valid at the continental level except for Africa at certain time\ninstants. We further examine the law at the country level, and note that Zipf's\nlaw is violated from country to country or from time to time. This violation is\nmainly due to our limitations; we are limited to individual countries, or to a\nstatic view on city-size distributions. The central argument of this paper is\nthat Zipf's law is universal, and we therefore must use the correct scope in\norder to observe it. We further find Zipf's law applied to city numbers; the\nnumber of cities in the first largest country is twice as many as that in the\nsecond largest country, three times as many as that in the third largest\ncountry, and so on.

Doing so, the breathers\nignite an escape by pulling the remaining chain over the barrier. Even if the\nformation of singular breathers is insufficient for an escape, coalescence of\nmoving breathers can result in the required concentration of energy. Compared\nto a chain system with linear damping and thermal fluctuations the breathers\nhelp the chain to overcome the barriers faster in the case of low damping.

In order to unravel some key properties\nenabling the emergence of structures potentially able to sustain their own\nexistence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe\nthem in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by\ndifferent structural properties. From the point of view of network topology, an\nautocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected\ncomponents (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets\n(RAFs).

This parameter\nalso affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized\ninto linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs. Interestingly, we show that the\ndifferent network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems)\ndoes not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance,\nwhereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to\nplay a role.

An important open question is whether this is a\nresult of evolutionary optimization or a universal feature of life. In the\nlatter case, the origin of life would be coincident with a shift in\nenvironmental conditions. Here we present a model for the emergence of life in\nwhich replicators are explicitly coupled to their environment through the\nrecycling of a finite supply of resources. The model exhibits a dynamic,\nfirst-order phase transition from non-life to \"life,\" where the life phase is\ndistinguished by selection on replicators. We show that environmental coupling\nplays an important role in the dynamics of the transition. The transition\ncorresponds to a redistribution of matter in replicators and their environment,\ndriven by selection on replicators, exhibiting an explosive growth in diversity\nas replicators are selected. The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual\ninformation shared between replicators and their environment. In the absence of\nsuccessfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete,\nleading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges.\nOften, the replicators that initiate the transition are not those that are\nultimately selected. The results are consistent with the view that life's\npropensity to shape its environment is indeed a universal feature of\nreplicators, characteristic of the transition from non-life to life.

        "summary": "  One of the fundamental problems in biology concerns the method by which a\ncluster of organisms can regulate the proportion of individuals that perform\nvarious roles or modes as if each individual knows a whole situation without a\nleader. A specific ratio exists in various species at multiple levels from the\nprocess of cell differentiation in multicellular organisms to the situation of\nsocial dilemma in a group of human beings. This study found a common basis of\nregulating a collective behavior which is realized by a series of local\ncontacts between individuals. The most essential behavior of individuals in\nthis theory is to change its internal mode through sharing information in\ncontact with others. Our numerical simulations with cellular automata model\nrealize to regulate the ratio of population of individuals who has either two\nkinds of modes. From the theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we\nfound that asymmetric properties in local contacts, are essential for adaptive\nregulation in response to the global information such a group size and whole\ndensity. Furthermore, a discrete system is crucial in no-leader groups to\nrealize the flexible regulation, and the critical condition which eliminates\noverlap with one another (excluded volume effect) also affects the resulting\nproportion in high density. The foremost advantage of this strategy is that no\nglobal information is required for each individual, and only a couple of mode\nswitching can achieve the whole proportion regulation. The simple mechanism say\nthat proportion regulation in well-organized groups in nature can be realized\nthrough and limited to local contacts, and has a potential to solve various\nphenomena that microscopic individuals behaviors connect to macroscopic orderly\nbehaviors.\n",

In addition, we put forward an analytical method to\napproximately calculate the phase-angles for the synchronous oscillators.\n",

The node\ndynamics thus depend on heterogeneous (rather than uncertain) parameters, whose\ndistribution over the network results from the network structure. Knowing these\ndistributions allows us to obtain an efficient coarse-grained representation of\nthe network state in terms of the expansion coefficients in suitable orthogonal\npolynomials. This representation is closely related to\nmathematical/computational tools for uncertainty quantification (the Polynomial\nChaos approach and its associated numerical techniques). The Polynomial Chaos\ncoefficients provide a set of good collective variables for the observation of\ndynamics on a network, and subsequently, for the implementation of reduced\ndynamic models of it.

Preventing such large-scale outages is thus key for\nassuring a reliable power supply.

A crucial property of his framework is that it decouples\nthe meaning of a message from the mechanistic details from the actual\ncommunication process itself, which opened the way to solve long-standing\ncommunication problems. Here we argue that a similar impact could be expected\nby applying information theory in the context of complexity science to answer\nlong-standing, cross-domain questions about the nature of complex systems. This\nhappens by decoupling the domain-specific model details (e.g., neuronal\nnetworks, ecosystems, flocks of birds) from the cross-domain phenomena that\ncharacterize complex systems (e.g., criticality, robustness, tipping points).\nThis goes beyond using information theory as a non-linear correlation measure,\nnamely it allows describing a complex system entirely in terms of the storage,\ntransfer, and modification of informational bits. After all, a phenomenon that\ndoes not depend on model details should best be studied in a framework that\nstrips away all such details. We highlight the first successes of\ninformation-theoretic descriptions in the recent complexity literature, and\nemphasize that this type of research is still in its infancy. Finally we sketch\nhow such an information-theoretic description may even lead to a new type of\nuniversality among complex systems, with a potentially tremendous impact.

        "summary": "  Sudden failure of a single transmission element in a power grid can induce a\ndomino effect of cascading failures, which can lead to the isolation of a large\nnumber of consumers or even to the failure of the entire grid. Here we present\nresults of the simulation of cascading failures in power grids, using an\nalternating current (AC) model. We first apply this model to a regular square\ngrid topology. For a random placement of consumers and generators on the grid,\nthe probability to find more than a certain number of unsupplied consumers\ndecays as a power law and obeys a scaling law with respect to system size.\nVarying the transmitted power threshold above which a transmission line fails\ndoes not seem to change the power law exponent $q \\approx 1.6$. Furthermore, we\nstudy the influence of the placement of generators and consumers on the number\nof affected consumers and demonstrate that large clusters of generators and\nconsumers are especially vulnerable to cascading failures. As a real-world\ntopology we consider the German high-voltage transmission grid. Applying the\ndynamic AC model and considering a random placement of consumers, we find that\nthe probability to disconnect more than a certain number of consumers depends\nstrongly on the threshold. For large thresholds the decay is clearly\nexponential, while for small ones the decay is slow, indicating a power law\ndecay.\n",

Sizable\ncirculating power flows have been recorded around such loops, which take up\ntransmission line capacity and dissipate but do not deliver electric power.\nPower flows in high voltage AC transmission grids are dominantly governed by\nvoltage angle differences between connected buses, much in the same way as\nJosephson currents depend on phase differences between tunnel-coupled\nsuperconductors. From this previously overlooked similarity we argue here that\ncirculating power flows in AC power grids are analogous to supercurrents\nflowing in superconducting rings and in rings of Josephson junctions. We\ninvestigate how circulating power flows can be created and how they behave in\nthe presence of ohmic dissipation. We show how changing operating conditions\nmay generate them, how significantly more power is ohmically dissipated in\ntheir presence and how they are topologically protected, even in the presence\nof dissipation, so that they persist when operating conditions are returned to\ntheir original values. We identify three mechanisms for creating circulating\npower flows, (i) by loss of stability of the equilibrium state carrying no\ncirculating loop flow, (ii) by tripping of a line traversing a large loop in\nthe network and (iii) by reclosing a loop that tripped or was open earlier.\nBecause voltage angles are uniquely defined, circulating power flows can take\non only discrete values, much in the same way as circulation around vortices is\nquantized in superfluids.\n",

In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is triggered by\nthe percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving),\nand large particles are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the\nupward migration of large particles is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which\nremains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or\nnumerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small\nparticles facilitates the upward movement of large particles. We found that in\nlarge particles, the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides\nwith the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and\nthe connectivity of large particles is much higher when they are squeezed\nthrough small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids\nhinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing\nlarge particles. Furthermore, increasing the coefficient of friction promotes\nrotation and empowers more large particles to reach the top layer, implying\nthat the climbing particles tend to rotate relative to their neighbors. Our\nfindings of the microstructure and movement pattern of individual particles add\nnew evidences to the mechanism of squeeze expulsion and provide new perspective\nfor the study of segregation.\n",

To characterize the\nwholeness and in particular to advocate for wholeness as an effective design\nprinciple, this paper develops a geographic representation that views cities as\na whole. This geographic representation is topology-oriented, so fundamentally\ndiffers from existing geometry-based geographic representations. With the\ntopological representation, all cities are abstracted as individual points and\nput into different hierarchical levels, according to their sizes and based on\nhead/tail breaks - a classification scheme and visualization tool for data with\na heavy tailed distribution. These points of different hierarchical levels are\nrespectively used to create Thiessen polygons. Based on polygon-polygon\nrelationships, we set up a complex network. In this network, small polygons\npoint to adjacent large polygons at the same hierarchical level and contained\npolygons point to containing polygons across two consecutive hierarchical\nlevels. We computed the degrees of wholeness for individual cities, and\nsubsequently found that the degrees of wholeness possess both properties of\ndifferentiation and adaptation. To demonstrate, we developed four case studies\nof all China and UK natural cities, as well as Beijing and London natural\ncities, using massive amounts of street nodes and Tweet locations.

Moreover, Zeno behaviors are\nexcluded in some cases. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate\nthe theoretical results.\n",

The state corresponds to have all layers\nsynchronized, with nodes in each layer which do not necessarily evolve in\nunison. So far, the study of such a solution has been restricted to the case in\nwhich all layers had an identical connectivity structure. When layers are not\nidentical, the inter-layer synchronous state is no longer a stable solution of\nthe system. Nevertheless, when layers differ in just a few links, an\napproximate treatment is still feasible, and allows one to gather information\non whether and how the system may wander around an inter-layer synchronous\nconfiguration. We report the details of an approximate analytical treatment for\na two-layer multiplex, which results in the introduction of an extra inertial\nterm accounting for structural differences. Numerical validation of the\npredictions highlights the usefulness of our approach, especially for small or\nmoderate topological differences in the intra-layer coupling. Moreover, we\nidentify a non-trivial relationship between the betweenness centrality of the\nmissing links and the intra-layer coupling strength. Finally, by the use of two\nmultiplexed identical layers of electronic circuits in a chaotic regime, we\nstudy the loss of inter-layer synchronization as a function of the betweenness\ncentrality of the removed links.\n",

We adopted some\ncomplexity science methods such as power-law detection and head/tail breaks\nclassification method for analysis and visualization. Head/tail breaks\nrecursively partitions data into a few large things in the head and many small\nthings in the tail.

We also discovered that users' first or most frequent chec-in locations\ncan be the representatives of users' spatial information. The constructed\nnetworks based on these locations are very heterogeneous, as indicated by the\nhigh ht-index. Most importantly, the node degree of the networks correlates\nhighly with the population at locations (mostly with R-square being 0.7) or\ncities (above 0.9).

Most of the previous studies on\nchimera states are not extensively done in two-dimensional ensembles of coupled\noscillators by taking neuronal systems with nonlinear coupling function into\naccount while such ensembles of oscillators are more realistic from a\nneurobiological point of view. In this paper, we report the emergence and\nexistence of chimera states by considering locally coupled two-dimensional\nnetworks of identical oscillators where each node is interacting through\nnonlinear coupling function. This is in contrast with the existence of chimera\nstates in two-dimensional nonlocally coupled oscillators with rectangular\nkernel in the coupling function. We find that the presence of nonlinearity in\nthe coupling function plays a key role to produce chimera states in\ntwo-dimensional locally coupled oscillators. We analytically verify explicitly\nin the case of a network of coupled Stuart - Landau oscillators in two\ndimensions that the obtained results using Ott-Antonsen approach and our\nanalytical finding very well matches with the numerical results. Next, we\nconsider another type of important nonlinear coupling function which exists in\nneuronal systems, namely chemical synaptic function, through which the\nnearest-neighbor (locally coupled) neurons interact with each other. In\nnumerical simulations, we consider two paradigmatic neuronal oscillators,\nnamely Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model and Rulkov map for each node which exhibit\nbursting dynamics.

Because the short-term timing of operation of\nsuch systems is inconsequential as long as their long-run average power\nconsumption is maintained, they are increasingly used in demand response (DR)\nprograms to balance supply and demand on the power grid. Here, we present an\n\\textit{ab initio} phase model for general TCLs, and use the concept to develop\na continuous oscillator model of a TCL and compute its phase response to\nchanges in temperature and applied power. This yields a simple control system\nmodel that can be used to evaluate control policies for modulating the power\nconsumption of aggregated loads with parameter heterogeneity and stochastic\ndrift. We demonstrate this concept by comparing simulations of ensembles of\nheterogeneous loads using the continuous state model and an established hybrid\nstate model. The developed phase model approach is a novel means of evaluating\nDR provision using TCLs, and is instrumental in estimating the capacity of\nancillary services or DR on different time scales. We further propose a novel\nphase response based open-loop control policy that effectively modulates the\naggregate power of a heterogeneous TCL population while maintaining load\ndiversity and minimizing power overshoots. This is demonstrated by low-error\ntracking of a regulation signal by filtering it into frequency bands and using\nTCL sub-ensembles with duty cycles in corresponding ranges.

        "summary": "  Synchronization commonly occurs in many natural and man-made systems, from\nneurons in the brain to cardiac cells to power grids to Josephson junction\narrays. Transitions to or out of synchrony for coupled oscillators depend on\nseveral factors, such as individual frequencies, coupling, interaction time\ndelays and network structure-function relation. Here, using a generalized\nKuramoto model of time-delay coupled phase oscillators with frequency-weighted\ncoupling, we study the stability of incoherent and coherent states and the\ntransitions to or out of explosive (abrupt, first-order like) phase\nsynchronization. We analytically derive the exact formulas for the critical\ncoupling strengths at different time delays in both directions of increasing\n(forward) and decreasing (backward) coupling strengths. We find that time-delay\ndoes not affect the transition for the backward direction but shifts the\ntransition for the forward direction of increasing coupling strength. These\nresults provide valuable insights into our understanding of dynamical\nmechanisms for explosive synchronization in presence of often unavoidable time\ndelays present in many physical and biological systems.\n",

One\nsuch application in which we are interested is the alignment of orientation\nvectors among members of a swarm. Despite being commonly used for this purpose,\nthe Kuramoto model can only describe swarms in 2 dimensions, and hence the\nresults obtained do not apply to the often relevant situation of swarms in 3\ndimensions. Partly based on this motivation, as well as on relevance to the\nclassical, mean-field, zero-temperature Heisenberg model with quenched site\ndisorder, in this paper we study the Kuramoto model generalized to $D$\ndimensions. We show that in the important case of 3 dimensions, as well as for\nany odd number of dimensions, the $D$-dimensional generalized Kuramoto model\nfor heterogeneous units has dynamics that are remarkably different from the\ndynamics in 2 dimensions. In particular, for odd $D$ the transition to\ncoherence occurs discontinuously as the inter-unit coupling constant $K$ is\nincreased through zero, as opposed to the $D=2$ case (and, as we show, also the\ncase of even $D$) for which the transition to coherence occurs continuously as\n$K$ increases through a positive critical value $K_c$. We also demonstrate the\nqualitative applicability of our results to related models constructed\nspecifically to capture swarming and flocking dynamics in three dimensions.\n",

The group of oscillators yield a completely symmetric OD state\nwhen uncoupled to the external system, i.e. the two OD states occur with equal\nprobability. However, remarkably, when coupled to a common external system this\nsymmetry is significantly broken. For exponentially decaying external systems,\nthe symmetry breaking is very pronounced for low environmental damping and\nstrong oscillator-environment coupling. This is evident through the sharp\ntransition from the symmetric to asymmetric state occurring at a critical\noscillator-environment coupling strength and environmental damping rate.\nFurther, we consider time-varying connections to the common external\nenvironment, with a fraction of oscillator-environment links switching on and\noff. Interestingly, we find that the asymmetry induced by environmental\ncoupling decreases as a power law with increase in fraction of such on-off\nconnections. The suggests that blinking oscillator-environment links can\nrestore the symmetry of the OD state. Lastly, we demonstrate the generality of\nour results for a constant external drive, and find marked breaking of symmetry\nin the OD states there as well. When the constant environmental drive is large,\nthe asymmetry in the OD states is very large, and the transition between the\nsymmetric and asymmetric state with increasing oscillator-environment coupling\nis very sharp. So our results demonstrate an environmental coupling-induced\nmechanism for the prevalence of certain OD states in a system of oscillators,\nand suggests an underlying process for obtaining certain states preferentially\nin ensembles of oscillators with environment-mediated coupling.\n",

The time a perturbation needs to propagate to a\nmeasurement point is captured by an inherent delay time (or latency). A\ndetailed linear stability analysis demonstrates that a non-zero system delay\nacts destabilizing on the otherwise stable fixed point for sufficiently large\nfeedback strengths. The imaginary part of the dominant eigenvalue is bounded by\ntwice the feedback strength. In the relevant parameter space it changes\ndiscontinuously along specific lines when switching between branches of\neigenvalues. When the feedback control force is bounded by a sigmoid function,\na supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs at the stability-instability\ntransition. The frequency and amplitude of the resulting limit cycles respond\nto parameter changes like the dominant eigenvalue. In particular, they show\nsimilar discontinuities along specific lines.

However there are numerous practical examples where\ninteractions are present only at certain points of time owing to physical\nproximity. In this work, we concentrate on exploring the emergence of\ninterlayer and intralayer synchronization states in a multiplex dynamical\nnetwork comprising of layers having mobile nodes performing a random walk. We\nthoroughly illustrate the impacts of the network parameters, in particular the\nvision range $\\phi$ and the step size $u$ together with the inter- and\nintralayer coupling strengths $\\epsilon$ and $k$ on these synchronous states\narising in coupled R\\\"{o}ssler systems. The presented numerical results are\nvery well validated by analytically derived necessary conditions for the\nemergence and stability of the synchronous states. Furthermore, the robustness\nof the states of synchrony is studied under both structural and dynamical\nperturbations. We find interesting results on interlayer synchronization for a\ncontinuous removal of the interlayer links as well as for progressively created\nstatic nodes. We demonstrate that the mobility parameters responsible for\nintralayer movement of the nodes, can retrieve interlayer synchrony under such\nstructural perturbations. For further analysis of survivability of interlayer\nsynchrony against dynamical perturbations, we proceed through the investigation\nof single-node basin stability, where again the intralayer mobility properties\nhave noticeable impacts. We also discuss the scenarios related mainly to\neffects of the mobility parameters in terms of percolation of the whole\nnetwork.\n",

The model integrates random relocation moves\nover the links of the network with local interactions depending on the node\noccupation probabilities. The model is highly versatile, as the motion of the\nwalkers can be fed on topological properties of the nodes, such as their\ndegree, while any general nonlinear function of the occupation probability of a\nnode can be considered as local reaction term. In addition to this, the\nrelative strength of reaction and relocation can be tuned at will, depending on\nthe specific application being examined. We derive an analytical expression for\nthe occupation probability of the walkers at equilibrium in the most general\ncase. We show that it depends on different order derivatives of the local\nreaction functions and not only on the degree of a node, but also on the\naverage degree of its neighbours at various distances. For such a reason,\nreactive random walkers are very sensitive to the structure of a network and\nare a powerful way to detect network properties such as symmetries or\ndegree-degree correlations. As possible applications, we first discuss how the\noccupation probability of reactive random walkers can be used to define novel\nmeasures of functional centrality for the nodes of a network. We then\nillustrate how network components with the same symmetries can be revealed by\ntracking the evolution of reactive walkers.

Conversely,\nwe do not observe this behavior when the natural frequencies are very\ndissimilar. Previously, Bronski and the author gave upper and lower bounds for\nthe volume of the set of frequencies exhibiting phase-locking behavior. This\nwas done under the assumption that any two oscillators affect each other with\nequal strength. In this paper the author generalizes these upper and lower\nbounds by removing this assumption. Similar to the previous work with Bronski,\nwhere the upper and lower bounds are sums over spanning trees of the network,\nour generalized upper and lower bounds are sums over certain directed subgraphs\nof the network. In particular, our lower bound is a sum over directed spanning\ntrees.

Owing to this interaction\nscenario, the nonlinear neuronal oscillators are coupled indirectly via\nelectromagnetic induction with magnetic flux, through which neurons communicate\nin spite of the absent physical connections among them. The evolution of each\nneuron, here, is described by the three-dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose dynamics. We\ndemonstrate that the presence of such non-locally and globally interacting\nexternal environments induce a stationary alternating chimera pattern in the\nensemble of neurons, whereas in the local coupling limit the network exhibits\ntransient chimera state whenever the local dynamics of the neurons is of\nchaotic square-wave bursting type. For periodic square-wave bursting of the\nneurons, similar qualitative phenomenon has been witnessed with the exception\nof the disappearance of cluster states for non-local and global interactions.\nBesides these observations, we advance our work while providing confirmation of\nthe findings for neuronal ensembles exhibiting plateau bursting dynamics. These\nresults may deliver better interpretations for different aspects of\nsynchronization appearing in network of neurons through field coupling that\nalso relaxes the prerequisite of synaptic connectivity for realizing chimera\nstate in neuronal networks.\n",

Such dynamical degradation may have outright effect on the substantive\nnetwork performance. This enforces to provide some proper prescriptions to\novercome undesired circumstances. Through this article, we present a scheme\nbased on external feedback that can efficiently revive dynamism in damaged\nnetworks of active and inactive oscillators and thus enhance the network\nsurvivability. Both numerical and analytical investigations are performed in\norder to verify our claim. We also provide a comparative study on the\neffectiveness of this mechanism for feedbacks to the inactive group or to the\nactive group only. Most importantly, resurrection of dynamical activity is\nrealized even in time-delayed damaged networks, which are considered to be less\npersistent against deterioration in form of inactivity in the oscillators.\nFurthermore, prominence in our approach is substantiated by providing evidence\nof enhanced network persistence in complex network topologies taking\nsmall-world and scale-free architectures, which makes the proposed remedy quite\ngeneral. Besides the study in network of Stuart-Landau oscillators, affirmative\ninfluence of external feedback has been justified in network of chaotic Rossler\nsystems as well.\n",

In realistic social,\neconomical, and political systems, diversity in the knowledge, experience, and\nbackground among the individuals can be expected. Games in which the players do\nnot have an identical strategy set are hypergames. Studies of hypergame\ndynamics have been scarce, especially those on networks. We investigate\nevolutionary hypergame dynamics on regular lattices using a prototypical model\nof three available strategies, in which the strategy set of each player\ncontains two of the three strategies. Our computations reveal that more complex\ndynamical phases emerge from the system than those from the traditional\nevolutionary game dynamics with full knowledge of the complete set of available\nstrategies, which include single-strategy absorption phases, a cyclic\ncompetition (`rock-paper-scissors') type of phase, and an uncertain phase in\nwhich the dominant strategy adopted by the population is unpredictable.\nExploiting the pair interaction and mean field approximations, we obtain a\nqualitative understanding of the emergence of the single strategy and uncertain\nphases. We find the striking phenomenon of strategy revival associated with the\ncyclic competition phase and provide a qualitative explanation.Our work\ndemonstrates that the diversity in the individuals' strategy set can play an\nimportant role in the evolution of strategy distribution in the system.

The basic assumption which underlies the dynamics\nis that the information gathering process is not instantaneous but requires\nmaturation. Agents steadily refine and update their personal opinion via a\nrecurrent consultation of a public pool which stores information tokens (ITs).\nThe expectation for the innovative idea is monitored in real-time by counting\nthe number of stored ITs. The flow dynamics of ITs is assimilated to a single\nnode queuing system (QS) with feedback loop. It incorporates the information\npool (the waiting room), an IT inflow, and a service outflow that stylizes the\ninformation gathering process. Contrary to basic queuing theory, here the ITs\nroaming the QS are endowed with time-dependent internal variables. This\nadditional dynamic information is used to construct the information maturation\nprocess. Such a maturation of the information introduces response delays into\nthe dynamics, which ultimately generates the collective disillusionment trough.\nWe illustrate the introduced generic modeling framework by considering in\ndetails the hype cycle dynamics, a key managerial topic when dealing with\ndiffusion of innovation. In a second part of the paper, we introduce a stylized\nframework to detect, as soon as possible, the onset of the collective\ndisillusionment phase, while minimizing the frequency of false alarms.\n",

The hosting structure consists\nof two coupled symmetric linear oscillators (LOs) and the nonlinear energy sink\n(NES) is connected to one of them. The peculiar nonlinear dynamics of the\nresulting three-degree-of-freedom system is analytically described by means of\nits slow invariant manifold derived from a suitable rescaling, coupled with a\nharmonic balance procedure, applied to the governing equations transformed in\nmodal coordinates. On the basis of the first-order reduced model, the absorber\nis tuned and optimized to mitigate both modes for a broad range of impulsive\nload magnitudes applied to the LOs. On the one hand, for low-amplitude,\nin-well, oscillations, the parameters governing the bistable NES are tuned in\norder to make it functioning as a linear tuned mass damper (TMD); on the other,\nfor high-amplitude, cross-well, oscillations, the absorber is optimized on the\nbasis of the invariant manifolds features. The analytically predicted\nperformance of the resulting tuned bistable nonlinear energy sink (TBNES) are\nnumerically validated in terms of dissipation time; the absorption capabilities\nare eventually compared with either a TMD and a purely cubic NES. It is shown\nthat, for a wide range of impulse amplitudes, the TBNES allows the most\nefficient absorption even for the detuned mode, where a single TMD cannot be\neffective.\n",

When a network topology is\nalready known (or partially known), two associated goals are (i) to derive\nestimators for nodes of the network which cannot be directly observed or are\nimpractical to measure; and (ii) to quantitatively identify the dynamic\nrelations between nodes. In this article we address both problems in the\nchallenging scenario where only some outputs of the network are being measured\nand the inputs are not accessible. The approach makes use of the notion of\n$d$-separation for the graph associated with the network. In the considered\nclass of networks, it is shown that the proposed technique can determine or\nguide the choice of optimal sparse estimators. The article also derives\nidentification methods that are applicable to cases where loops are present\nproviding a different perspective on the problem of closed-loop identification.\nThe notion of $d$-separation is a central concept in the area of probabilistic\ngraphical models, thus an additional contribution is to create connections\nbetween control theory and machine learning techniques.\n",

We study the model for a generic choice of the\nnatural frequency distribution of the oscillators, to elucidate how a\nsynchronized phase bifurcates from an incoherent phase as the coupling constant\nbetween the oscillators is tuned. We show that in contrast to the case with no\ndelay, here the system in the stationary state may exhibit either a subcritical\nor a supercritical bifurcation between a synchronized and an incoherent phase,\nwhich is dictated by the value of the delay present in the interaction and the\nprecise value of inertia of the oscillators. Our theoretical analysis,\nperformed in the limit $N \\to \\infty$, is based on an unstable manifold\nexpansion in the vicinity of the bifurcation, which we apply to the kinetic\nequation satisfied by the single-oscillator distribution function.

In particular, research\nhas focused predominantly on all-to-all coupling, whereas current social\nnetworks and human interactions are often based on complex coupling\nconfigurations, such as nearest-neighbor coupling and small-world networks.\nBecause the synchronization of any ensemble is governed by its network\nparameters, studying different types of human networks while controlling the\ncoupling and the delay is essential for understanding the dynamics of different\ntypes of human networks.

In this study we consider a neural\nmass model, rigorously obtained from the microscopic dynamics of an inhibitory\nspiking network with exponential synapses, able to autonomously generate\ncollective oscillations (COs). These oscillations emerge via a super-critical\nHopf bifurcation, and their frequencies are controlled by the synaptic time\nscale, the synaptic coupling and the excitability of the neural population.\nFurthermore, we show that two inhibitory populations in a master-slave\nconfiguration with different synaptic time scales can display various\ncollective dynamical regimes: namely, damped oscillations towards a stable\nfocus, periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations, and chaos. Finally, when\nbidirectionally coupled the two inhibitory populations can exhibit different\ntypes of theta-gamma cross-frequency couplings (CFCs): namely, phase-phase and\nphase-amplitude CFC. The coupling between theta and gamma COs is enhanced in\npresence of a external theta forcing, reminiscent of the type of modulation\ninduced in Hippocampal and Cortex circuits via optogenetic drive.\n",

We test the theory\nagainst experimental results and circuit-level simulations in a prototype\nsystem of mutually delay-coupled electronic clocks, so called phase-locked\nloops.

DEA was used in the recent past to study\nneurophysiological processes that in the healthy condition are found to\ngenerate $1/f$ noise and $\\mu$ close to $2$.

This observation led us the conjectures that the seismic\ncriticality is due to the interaction of many faults. To support this\nconjecture we adopted a dynamical model for fault dynamics proposed by Brown\nand Tosatti and we have extended it to describe the interaction between many\nfaults. The DEA applied to surrogate sequences generated by this dynamical\nmodel, yields $\\mu = 2.1$ for a single fault and $\\mu = 2,4$ for many\ninteracting faults, in a good agreement with the observation of real seismic\nfluctuations.

Surprisingly, in this case,\nthe clustering coefficient of an estimator does not enhance its MSE while\nreducing total MSE of the population.\n",

        "summary": "  Empirical diagnosis of stability has received considerable attention, mostly\nfocused on variance metrics for early warning signals of abrupt system change.\nDespite this, the theoretical foundation and application has been limited to\nrelatively simple system changes such as bifurcating fixed points where\nvariability is extrinsic to the steady state. There is currently no foundation\nand associated metric for empirically exploring stability in wide ranging\nsystems that contain variability in both internal steady state dynamics and in\nresponse to external perturbations. Utilizing connections between stability,\ndissipation, and phase space flow, we show that stability correlates with\ntemporal asymmetry in a measure of phase space flow contraction. Our method is\ngeneral as it reveals stability variation independent of assumptions about the\nnature of system variability or attractor shape. After showing efficacy in a\nvariety of model systems, we apply our technique for measuring stability to\nmonthly returns of the S&P 500 index in the time periods surrounding the global\nstock market crash of October 1987. Market stability is shown to be higher in\nthe several years preceding and subsequent to the 1987 market crash. We\nanticipate our technique will have wide applicability in climate, ecological,\nfinancial, and social systems where stability is a pressing concern.\n",

Yet, in\nmany systems, interactions take place in larger groups. Recent work has shown\nthat higher-order interactions between oscillators can significantly affect\nsynchronization. However, these early studies have mostly considered\ninteractions up to 4 oscillators at time, and analytical treatments are limited\nto the all-to-all setting. Here, we propose a general framework that allows us\nto effectively study populations of oscillators where higher-order interactions\nof all possible orders are considered, for any complex topology described by\narbitrary hypergraphs, and for general coupling functions. To this scope, we\nintroduce a multi-order Laplacian whose spectrum determines the stability of\nthe synchronized solution. Our framework is validated on three structures of\ninteractions of increasing complexity. First, we study a population with\nall-to-all interactions at all orders, for which we can derive in a full\nanalytical manner the Lyapunov exponents of the system, and for which we\ninvestigate the effect of including attractive and repulsive interactions.\nSecond, we apply the multi-order Laplacian framework to synchronization on a\nsynthetic model with heterogeneous higher-order interactions. Finally, we\ncompare the dynamics of coupled oscillators with higher-order and pairwise\ncouplings only, for a real dataset describing the macaque brain connectome,\nhighlighting the importance of faithfully representing the complexity of\ninteractions in real-world systems. Taken together, our multi-order Laplacian\nallows us to obtain a complete analytical characterization of the stability of\nsynchrony in arbitrary higher-order networks, paving the way towards a general\ntreatment of dynamical processes beyond pairwise interactions.\n",

The wealth evolution trend can then be\ndescribed by an ordinary differential equation with three free parameters. The\nsolution features a finite time singularity, which suggests a lack of long term\nsustainability. The year at which the singularity occurs has a slight variation\nnear 2020 AD from one country to another. GDP time series curtailed after 1900\nAD produce similar values for the occurrence of the singularity, which thus\ncould be predicted more than hundred years ago.

Instead of applying flame describing function to\ndepict the unsteady heat release rate as the flame's response to acoustic\nperturbation, the new model considers the acoustic field and the unsteady heat\nrelease rate as a pair of nonlinearly coupled damped oscillators. By varying\nthe coupling strength, multiple dynamical behaviors, including limit cycle\noscillation, quasi-periodic oscillation, strange nonchaos, and chaos can be\ncaptured.

We consider two types of noise: i) phase\nnoise acting on the oscillator state variable and ii) stochastic fluctuations\nof the coupling delay. For both types of stochastic perturbations the system\nhops between the deterministic regimes, but it shows dramatically different\nscaling properties for different types of noise. The robustness to conventional\nphase noise increases with coupling strength. However for stochastic variations\nin the coupling delay, the lifetimes decrease exponentially with the coupling\nstrength. We provide an analytic explanation for these scaling properties in a\nlinearised model. Our findings thus indicate that the robustness of a system to\nstochastic perturbations strongly depends on the nature of these perturbations.\n",

In spite of its apparent simplicity, as the population\ngrowth-rate is increased the map exhibits a broad range of dynamics, which\ninclude bifurcation cascades going from periodic to chaotic solutions. Studying\ncoupled maps allows to identify other qualitative changes in the collective\ndynamics, such as pattern formations or hysteresis. Particularly, hysteresis is\nthe appearance of different attracting sets, a set when the control parameter\nis increased and another set when it is decreased -- a multi-stable region. In\nthis work, we present an experimental study on the bifurcations and hysteresis\nof nearly identical, coupled, logistic maps. Our logistic maps are an\nelectronic system that has a discrete-time evolution with a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio ($\\sim10^6$), resulting in simple, precise, and reliable\nexperimental manipulations, which include the design of a modifiable diffusive\ncoupling configuration circuit. We find that the characterisations of the\nisolated and coupled logistic-maps' dynamics agrees excellently with the\ntheoretical and numerical predictions (such as the critical bifurcation points\nand Feigenbaum's bifurcation velocity). Here, we report multi-stable regions\nappearing robustly across configurations, even though our configurations had\nparameter mismatch (which we measure directly from the components of the\ncircuit and also infer from the resultant dynamics for each map) and were\nunavoidably affected by electronic noise.\n",

The results are\ndemonstrated for two different examples consisting of single layer and multi\nlayer networks. First, the chimera states (solitary states) are engineered by\nestablishing delays in the neighboring links of a node (the interlayer links)\nin a 2-D lattice (multiplex network) of oscillators. Then, different machine\nlearning classifiers, KNN, SVM and MLP-Neural Network are employed by feeding\nthe data obtained from the network models. Once a machine learning model is\ntrained using a limited amount of data, it makes predictions for a given\nunknown systems parameter values. Testing accuracy, sensitivity, and\nspecificity analysis reveal that MLP-NN classifier is better suited than Knn or\nSVM classifier for the predictions of parameters values for engineered chimera\nand solitary states.

By far the most well studied examples concern physical\ninteractions through a fluid: beating cilia, swimming sperm and worms, and\nflapping wings, all display synchronization behavior through fluid mechanical\ninteractions. However, as the density of a collective increases individuals may\nalso interact with each other through physical contact. In the field of \"active\nmatter\" systems, it is well known that inelastic contact between individuals\ncan produce long-range correlations in position, orientation, and velocity. In\nthis work we demonstrate that contact interactions between undulating robots\nyield novel phase dynamics such as synchronized motions. We consider undulatory\nsystems in which rhythmic motion emerges from time-independent oscillators that\nsense and respond to undulatory bending angle and speed. In pair experiments we\ndemonstrate that robot joints will synchronize to in-phase and anti-phase\noscillations through collisions and a phase-oscillator model describes the\nstability of these modes. To understand how contact interactions influence the\nphase dynamics of larger groups we perform simulations and experiments of\nsimple three-link undulatory robots that interact only through contact.\nCollectives synchronize their movements through contact as predicted by the\ntheory and when the robots can adjust their position in response to contact we\nno longer observe anti-phase synchronization. Lastly we demonstrate that\nsynchronization dramatically reduces the interaction forces within confined\ngroups of undulatory robots indicating significant energetic and safety\nbenefits from group synchronization. The theory and experiments in this study\nillustrate how contact interactions in undulatory active matter can lead to\nnovel collective motion and synchronization.\n",

One of the most\npractical methods for investigating the synchronization properties of such a\nrhythmic system is to statistically extract phase coupling functions between\nlimit-cycle oscillators directly from observed time-series data. In Particular,\nusing a method that combines phase reduction theory and Bayesian inference, the\nphase coupling functions can be extracted from the time-series data of even\njust one variable in each oscillatory dynamical system with many degrees of\nfreedom. However, it remains unclear how the choice of the observed variables\naffects the statistical inference for the phase coupling functions. In this\nstudy, we examine the influence of observed variable types on the extraction of\nphase coupling functions using some typical dynamical elements under various\nconditions. We demonstrate that our method can consistently extract the\nmacroscopic phase coupling functions between two phases representing collective\noscillations in a fully locked state, regardless of the observed variable\ntypes; for example, even using one variable of any element in one system and\nthe mean-field value over all the elements in another system. We also study the\ncase of globally coupled phase oscillators in a partially locked state. Our\nresults reveal directional asymmetry in the robustness of extracting the\nmacroscopic phase coupling function between two networks. For instance, when an\nasynchronous oscillator in network $A$ and the macroscopic collective\noscillation of network $B$ is observed, the macroscopic phase coupling function\nfrom network $A$ to network $B$ can be extracted more robustly than in the\nopposite direction.\n",

Further, quantifying the energy cost through\nconcentration control of the chemical fuel aids in unveiling the association of\nthe energy and chemical work with the optimal operating region of the\nbiological error-correcting mechanism. It is shown that the proper energy\ncontent of the system, the semigrand Gibbs free energy, approaches a nominal\nvalue in the trade-off regime, whereas it gets considerably minimized in the\ndomain with a lack of trade-off. We have also introduced a performance\nmeasuring entity corresponding to different energetic discrimination magnitudes\nas a product of average dissipation and coefficient of variation for the whole\nrange of chemical fuel.

Naturally, strict instances of this phenomenon, such as the\nstates of complete synchronization are favored, or even ensured, in networks\nwith a high density of connections. Conversely, in sparse networks, the system\nstate-space is often shared by a variety of coexistent solutions. Consequently,\nthe convergence to complete synchronized states is far from being certain. In\nthis scenario, we report the surprising phenomenon in which completely\nsynchronized states are made the sole attractor of sparse networks by removing\nnetwork links, the sparsity-driven synchronization. This phenomenon is observed\nnumerically for nonlocally coupled Kuramoto networks and verified analytically\nfor locally coupled ones. In addition, we reduce the network equations to a\none-dimension dynamical system to unravel the bifurcation scenario underlying\nthe network transition to completely synchronized behavior. Furthermore, we\npresent a simple procedure, based on the bifurcations in the thermodynamic\nlimit, that determines the minimum number of links to be removed in order to\nensure complete synchronization. Finally, we propose an application of the\nreported phenomenon as a control scheme to drive complete synchronization in\nhigh connectivity networks.\n",

Since then such patterns, called chimera states, have\nbeen the subject of intensive study but mostly in the stationary case when the\ncoarse-grained system dynamics remains unchanged over time. Nonstationary\ncoherence-incoherence patterns, in particular periodically breathing chimera\nstates, were also reported, however not investigated systematically because of\ntheir complexity. In this paper we suggest a semi-analytic solution to the\nabove problem providing a mathematical framework for the analysis of breathing\nchimera states in a ring of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators. Our approach\nrelies on the consideration of an integro-differential equation describing the\nlong-term coarse-grained dynamics of the oscillator system. For this equation\nwe specify a class of solutions relevant to breathing chimera states. We derive\na self-consistency equation for these solutions and carry out their stability\nanalysis. We show that our approach correctly predicts macroscopic features of\nbreathing chimera states.

Recent studies,\nhowever, suggest that rules simpler than local averaging may be at play in real\norganisms; for example, fish stochastically align towards only one randomly\nchosen neighbour and yet the schools are highly polarised. Here, we ask -- how\ndo organisms maintain group cohesion? Using a spatially-explicit model,\ninspired from empirical investigations, we show that group cohesion can be\nachieved even when organisms randomly choose only one neighbour to interact\nwith. Cohesion is maintained even in the absence of local averaging that\nrequires interactions with many neighbours. Furthermore, we show that choosing\na neighbour randomly is a better way to achieve cohesion than interacting with\njust its closest neighbour. To understand how cohesion emerges from these\nrandom pairwise interactions, we turn to a graph-theoretic analysis of the\nunderlying dynamic interaction networks. We find that randomness in choosing a\nneighbour gives rise to well-connected networks that essentially cause the\ngroups to stay cohesive. We compare our findings with the canonical averaging\nmodels (analogous to the Vicsek model).

To this aim, we formally derive the\ncompartmental model from an appropriate microscopic one.

Microscopic rules\ndescribe both the switch of compartment and the evolution of the viral load.

It\nis also found that optimizing the synchronization by maximizing the order\nparameter or the phase cohesiveness may dramatically increase the value of the\nmetric and decrease the mean first hitting time, thus decrease the\nsynchronization stability.\n",

In this general\nframework, it is shown that the mathematical structures of self-organization\nand of decision making are identical.

In all\nthese cases, self-organization is described as the process of evaluating the\nprobabilities of macroscopic states or prospects in the search for a state with\nthe largest probability.

Our system, consisting\nof nonlinear amplitude-phase oscillators arranged in a ring topology with\nreactive nearest neighbor coupling, is simple and connects directly to\nexperimental realizations. We seek to understand how the multiple stable\nsynchronized states connect to each other in state space by applying Gaussian\nwhite noise to each of the oscillators' phases. To do this, we first identify a\nset of locally stable limit cycles at any given coupling strength. For each of\nthese attracting states, we analyze the effect of weak noise via the covariance\nmatrix of deviations around those attractors. We then explore the noise-induced\nattractor switching behavior via numerical investigations. For a ring of three\noscillators we find that an attractor-switching event is always accompanied by\nthe crossing of two adjacent oscillators' phases. For larger numbers of\noscillators we find that the distribution of times required to stochastically\nleave a given state falls off exponentially, and we build an attractor\nswitching network out of the destination states as a coarse-grained description\nof the high-dimensional attractor-basin architecture.\n",

Real networks exhibit assortative mixing\nby vertex degree, however typical random network models, such as Erdos-Renyi or\nBarabasi-Albert, show no assortative arrangements. In this paper we introduce\nthe neighborhood assortativity notion, as the tendency of a node to belong to a\ncommunity (its neighborhood) showing an average property similar to its own.\nImposing neighborhood assortative mixing by degree in a network toy model, SOC\ndynamics can be found. The long-range correlations resulting from the\ncriticality have been characterized by means of fluctuation analysis and show\nan anticorrelation in the node's activity. The model contains only one\nparameter and its statistics plots for different values of the parameter can be\ncollapsed into a single curve. The simplicity of the model allows performing\nnumerical simulations and also to study analytically the statistics for a\nspecific value of the parameter, making use of the Markov chains.\n",

A realistic dispersal structure which favors\nthe persistence of interacting ecological systems has been studied in [Holland\n\\& Hastings, Nature, 456:792--795 (2008)], where it is shown that a\nrandomization of the structure of dispersal network in a metapopulation model\nof prey and predator increases the species persistence via clustering,\nprolonged transient dynamics, and amplitudes of population fluctuations. In\nthis paper, by contrast, we show that a deterministic network topology in a\nmetapopulation can also favor asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics if\nspecies dispersal obeys a long-range interaction governed by a\ndistance-dependent power-law. To explore the effects of power-law coupling, we\ntake a realistic ecological model, namely the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model in\neach patch (node) of the network of oscillators, and show that the coupled\nsystem is driven from synchrony to asynchrony with an increase in the power-law\nexponent. Moreover, to understand the relationship between species persistence\nand variations in power-law exponent, we compute correlation coefficient to\ncharacterize cluster formation, synchrony order parameter and median predator\namplitude. We further show that smaller metapopulations with less number of\npatches are more vulnerable to extinction as compared to larger metapopulations\nwith higher number of patches.

A recently proposed simple model has revealed a general mechanism by\nwhich such systems can become robust against inclusion of elements with random\ninteractions when the elements have a moderate number of links. This happens as\na result of two opposing effects such that while the inclusion of elements with\nmore interactions makes each individual element more robust against\ndisturbances, it also increases the net impact of the loss of any element in\nthe system. The interaction is, however, in many systems often intrinsically\nbidirectional like for mutual symbiosis, competition in ecology, and the\naction-reaction law of Newtonian mechanics, etc. This study reports the strong\nreinforcement effect of the bidirectionality of the interactions on the\nrobustness of evolving systems. We show that the system with purely\nbidirectional interactions can grow with two-fold average degree, in comparison\nwith the purely unidirectional system. This drastic shift of the transition\npoint comes from the reinforcement of each node, not from a change in structure\nof the emergent system. For systems with partially bidirectional interactions\nwe find that the area of the growing phase gets expanded. In the dense\ninteraction regime, there exists an optimum proportion of bidirectional\ninteractions for the growth rate at around $1/3$. In the sparsely connected\nsystems, small but finite fraction of bidirectional links can change the\nsystem's behaviour from non-growing to growing behaviour.\n",

We study here the role of inhibition in a\nrepresentative dynamical network model, characterizing the dynamics of random\nthreshold networks with both excitatory and inhibitory links. Varying the\nfraction of excitatory links has a strong effect on the network's population\nactivity and its sensitivity to perturbation. The average degree $K$, known to\nhave a strong effect on the dynamics when small, loses its influence on the\ndynamics as its value increases. Instead, the strength of inhibition is a\ndeterminant of dynamics and sensitivity here, allowing for criticality only in\na specific corridor of inhibition. This criticality corridor requires that\nexcitation dominates, while the balance region corresponds to maximum\nsensitivity to perturbation. We develop mean-field approximations of the\npopulation activity and sensitivity and find that the network dynamics is\nindependent of degree distribution for high $K$. In a minimal model of an\nadaptive threshold network we demonstrate how the dynamics remains robust\nagainst changes in the topology. This adaptive model can be extended in order\nto generate networks with a controllable activity distribution and specific\ntopologies.\n",

Current theory predicts that random autonomous systems can be either\nordered or chaotic with fast phase transition between them. However, modeled\nadapted systems are not fully random, they are usually stable, but the\nestimated parameters are usually \"chaotic\", they place the fully random\nnetworks in the chaotic regime, far from the narrow phase transition. It is\nshowed that among the not fully random systems with \"chaotic parameters\", a\nlarge third state called half-chaos exists, which simultaneously exhibit small\n(ordered) and large (chaotic) reactions for small disturbances in similar\nshare. The discovery of half-chaos frees modeling of adapted systems from sharp\nrestrictions; it allows to use \"chaotic parameters\" and get a nearly stable\nsystem more similar to modeled one. It gives a base for identity criterion of\nan evolving object, simplifies the definition of basic Darwinian mechanism and\nchanges \"life on the edge of chaos\" to \"life evolves in the half-chaos of not\nfully random systems\".\n",

Using\nthe theory of weakly coupled oscillators, we explore the effect of both\nsubthreshold and spike-mediated coupling on synchrony in small networks of\nelectrically coupled resonate-and-fire neurons, a hybrid neuron model with\nlinear subthreshold dynamics and discrete post-spike reset. We calculate the\nphase response curve using an extension of the adjoint method that accounts for\nthe discontinuity in the dynamics.

The subthreshold\ncontribution is strongest when the voltage exhibits a significant post-spike\nelevation in voltage, or plateau. Additionally, we show that the geometry of\ntrajectories approaching the spiking threshold causes a \"reset-induced shear\"\neffect that can oppose synchrony in the presence of network asymmetry, despite\nhaving no effect on the phase-locking of symmetrically coupled pairs.\n",

In the latter case, the ongoing transition to\ndistributed renewable energy sources is leading to a proliferation of dynamical\nactors. The desynchronization of a few or even one of those would likely result\nin a substantial blackout. Thus the dynamical stability of the synchronous\nstate has become a focus of power grid research in recent years. In this letter\nwe uncover that the non-linear stability against large perturbations is\ndominated and threatened by the presence of \\textit{solitary states} in which\nindividual actors desynchronise. Remarkably, when taking physical losses in the\nnetwork into account, the back-reaction of the network induces new {\\it exotic}\nsolitary states in the individual actors, and the stability characteristics of\nthe synchronous state are dramatically altered. These novel effects will have\nto be explicitly taken into account in the design of future power grids, and\ntheir existence poses a challenge for control. While this letter focuses on\npower grids, the form of the coupling we explore here is generic, and the\npresence of new states is very robust.

We focus on both the steady state and\nrelaxation dynamics of the model. The bare model with annealed noise on finite\n$2D$ lattice, in the stationary state, exhibits a crossover from\nsynchronization to desynchronization as noise strength varies. Finite-size\nscaling (FSS) analysis reveals that, in the thermodynamic limit, this crossover\nbecomes a true phase transition, which is Kosterlitz-Thouless ($KT$)-type\nanalogous to that of $2D$ $XY$ model. On the other hand, when the noise is\nquenched, it does not show any kind of synchronization-desynchronization phase\ntransition in the thermodynamic limit. But we do observe a crossover from low\nnoise-strength synchronization to high noise-strength desynchronization in\nfinite lattices. We analyze the crossover phenomena through the linear\nstability of the stationary state solutions and obtain the crossover\nnoise-strength from the onset of local instability of the unsynchronized one.\nThe relaxation dynamics also differs for these two types of noise. In case of\nannealed noise, the system, in the critically ordered phase, exhibits algebraic\nrelaxation which is described by the phenomenological Edwards-Wilkinson (EW)\nmodel of growing surface, yielding the same dynamic exponent $z =2$. In\ndisordered phase, the system shows an exponential decay. On the contrary, the\nsystem with quenched noise, as opposed to the annealed one, always relaxes to\nthe stationary state exponentially. Both the system-size and noise-strength\ndependency of the average relaxation time in the synchronized regime are also\ninvestigated.\n",

Various systems\nin physics, biology, social sciences and engineering have been successfully\nmodelled as networks of coupled dynamical systems, where the graph links\ndescribe pairwise interactions. This is, however, too strong a limitation, as\nrecent studies have revealed that higher-order many-body interactions are\npresent in social groups, ecosystems and in the human brain, and they actually\naffect the emergent dynamics of all these systems. Here, we introduce a general\nframework that allows to study coupled dynamical systems accounting for the\nprecise microscopic structure of their interactions at any possible order. We\nconsider the most general ensemble of identical dynamical systems, organized on\nthe nodes of a simplicial complex, and interacting through\nsynchronization-non-invasive coupling function. The simplicial complex can be\nof any dimension, meaning that it can account, at the same time, for pairwise\ninteractions, three-body interactions and so on. In such a broad context, we\nshow that complete synchronization exists as an invariant solution, and we give\nthe necessary condition for it to be observed as a stable state in terms of a\nMaster Stability Function. This generalizes the existing results valid for\npairwise interactions (i.e. graphs) to the case of complex systems with the\nmost general possible architecture.

In a\ntypical interaction represented by the perfect graph, an infinite number of\nuniversality classes is yielded by dependency on the natural frequency\ndistribution and the coupling function.

It is well-understood that, in the usual mean-field scaling, full\nphase-locking is unlikely and that it is partially phase-locked states that are\nimportant in applications. Despite this, while there has been much attention\ngiven to the existence and stability of fully phase-locked states in the finite\nN Kuramoto model, the partially phase-locked states have received much less\nattention. In this paper, we present two related results. Firstly, we derive an\nanalytical criterion that, for sufficiently strong coupling, guarantees the\nexistence of a partially phase-locked state by proving the existence of an\nattracting ball around a fixed point of a subset of the oscillators. We also\nderive a larger invariant ball such that any point in it will asymptotically\nconverge to the attracting ball. Secondly, we consider the large N\n(thermodynamic) limit for the Kuramoto system with randomly distributed\nfrequencies. Using some results of De Smet and Aeyels on partial entrainment,\nwe derive a deterministic condition giving almost sure existence of a partially\nentrained state for sufficiently strong coupling when the natural frequencies\nof the individual oscillators are independent identically distributed random\nvariables, as well as upper and lower bounds on the size of the largest cluster\nof partially entrained oscillators. Interestingly in a series on numerical\nexperiments we find that the observed size of the largest entrained cluster is\npredicted extremely well by the upper bound.\n",

We study here a nontrivial\ngeneralization of the Kuramoto model by including an interaction that breaks\nexplicitly the rotational symmetry of the model. In an inertial frame (e.g.,\nthe laboratory frame), the Kuramoto model does not allow for a stationary\nstate, that is, a state with time-independent value of the so-called Kuramoto\n(complex) synchronization order parameter $z\\equiv re^{i\\psi}$; Note that a\ntime-independent $z$ implies $r$ and $\\psi$ both time independent, with the\nlatter fact corresponding to a state in which $\\psi$ rotates at zero frequency\n(no rotation). In this backdrop, we ask: Does the introduction of the\nsymmetry-breaking term suffice to allow for the existence of a stationary state\nin the laboratory frame? Compared to the original model, we reveal a rather\nrich phase diagram of the resulting model, with the existence of both\nstationary and standing wave phases. While in the former the synchronization\norder parameter $r$ has a long-time value that is time independent, one has in\nthe latter an oscillatory behavior of the order parameter as a function of time\nthat nevertheless yields a non-zero and time-independent time average. Our\nresults are based on numerical integration of the dynamical equations as well\nas an exact analysis of the dynamics by invoking the so-called Ott-Antonsen\nansatz that allows to derive a reduced set of time-evolution equations for the\norder parameter.\n",

The effect of uncertainty in a large-scale networked system is not\nclear, especially when uncertainties cascade between connected nodes. In order\nto quantify resilience uncertainty across the network resolutions (macro to\nmicro),an arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion method is developed in\nthis paper to estimate the resilience subject to parameter uncertainties with\narbitrary distributions. For the first time and of particular importance, is\nour ability to identify the probability of a node in losing its resilience and\nhow the different model parameters contribute to this risk.

Recent experimental observations\nsuggest that the system passively (self-)adapts the axial location of the\nslider to achieve and maintain a condition of self-resonance, which could be\nuseful in applications such as energy harvesting. The purpose of this work is\nto provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon based on an appropriate\nmodel. A key feature of the proposed model is a small clearance between the\nslider and the beam. This clearance gives rise to backlash and frictional\ncontact interactions, both of which are found to be essential for the\nself-adaptive behavior. Contact is modeled in terms of the Coulomb and\nSignorini laws, together with the Newton impact law. The set-valued character\nof the contact laws is accounted for in a measure differential inclusion\nformulation. Numerical integration is carried out using Moreau's time-stepping\nscheme. The proposed model reproduces qualitatively most experimental\nobservations. However, although the system showed a distinct self-adaptive\ncharacter, the behavior was found to be non-resonant for the considered set of\nparameters. Beside estimating the relationship between resonance frequency and\nslider location, the model permits predicting the operating limits with regard\nto excitation level and frequency. Finally, some specific dynamical phenomena\nsuch as hysteresis effects and transient resonance captures underline the rich\ndynamical behavior of the system.\n",

Increased interest has lead to their discovery in ever new settings, both\ntheoretical and experimental. Less well-discussed is the fact that successive\nresults have also broadened the notion of what actually constitutes a chimera\nstate. In this article, we critically examine how the results for different\nmodel types and coupling schemes, as well as varying implicit interpretations\nof terms such as coexistence, synchrony and incoherence, have influenced the\ncommon understanding of what constitutes a chimera. We cover both theoretical\nand experimental systems, address various chimera-derived terms that have\nemerged over the years and finally reflect on the question of chimera states in\nreal-world contexts.\n",

However, little\nattention has been paid to the description of the dynamical development of each\nindividual networked unit in the process towards the synchronization of the\nwhole ensemble. In this paper, we show how in a network of identical dynamical\nsystems, nodes belonging to the same degree class differentiate in the same\nmanner visiting a sequence of states of diverse complexity along the route to\nsynchronization independently on the global network structure. In particular,\nwe observe, just after interaction starts pulling orbits from the initially\nuncoupled attractor, a general reduction of the complexity of the dynamics of\nall units being more pronounced in those with higher connectivity. In the weak\ncoupling regime, when synchronization starts to build up, there is an increase\nin the dynamical complexity whose maximum is achieved, in general, first in the\nhubs due to their earlier synchronization with the mean field. For very strong\ncoupling, just before complete synchronization, we found a hierarchical\ndynamical differentiation with lower degree nodes being the ones exhibiting the\nlargest complexity departure. We unveil how this differentiation route holds\nfor several models of nonlinear dynamics including toroidal chaos and how it\ndepends on the coupling function. This study provides new insights to\nunderstand better strategies for network identification and control or to\ndevise effective methods for network inference.\n",

With a view to gaining insights into this problem, we\nconstruct a coupled map lattice of the paradigmatic chaotic logistic map by\nadopting the Watts--Strogatz network algorithm. The map models the agent's\nchaotic state dynamics. In the model, an agent benefits by synchronizing with\nits neighbours and in the process of doing so, it pays a cost. The agents\nupdate their strategies (cooperation or defection) by using either a stochastic\nor a deterministic rule in an attempt to fetch themselves higher payoffs than\nwhat they already have. Among some other interesting results, we find that\nbeyond a critical coupling strength, that increases with the rewiring\nprobability parameter of the Watts--Strogatz model, the coupled map lattice is\nspatiotemporally synchronized regardless of the rewiring probability. Moreover,\nwe observe that the population does not desynchronize completely -- and hence\nfinite level of cooperation is sustained -- even when the average degree of the\ncoupled map lattice is very high. These results are at odds with how a\npopulation of the non-chaotic Kuramoto oscillators as agents would behave. Our\nmodel also brings forth the possibility of the emergence of cooperation through\nsynchronization onto a dynamical state that is a periodic orbit attractor.\n",

Transition scenarios among all these\ndistinguishable patterns are numerically demonstrated for a wide range of the\ndiffusion coefficients which reveal that the chimera states arise during the\ntransition from oscillatory to steady state dynamics. Furthermore, we\ncharacterize the occurrence of each of the recognizable patterns by estimating\nthe strength of incoherent subpopulations in the two-dimensional space.\n",

In the present study, an agent-based\nAdversarial swarm model is developed comprising of two competing swarms, the\nAttackers and the Defenders, respectively. The Defender's aim is to protect a\npoint of interest in unbounded 2D Euclidean space referred to as the Goal. In\ncontrast, the Attacker's main task is to intercept the Goal while continually\ntrying to evade the Defenders, which gets attracted to it when they are in a\ncertain vicinity of the Goal termed as the sphere of influence, essentially a\ncircular perimeter. The interaction of the two swarms was studied from a\nDynamical systems perspective by changing the number of Agents making up each\nrespective swarm. The simulations were strongly investigated for the presence\nof chaos by evaluating the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), implementing phase\nspace reconstruction. The source of chaos in the system was observed to be\ninduced by the passively constrained motion of the Defender agents around the\nGoal. Multiple local equilibrium points existed for the Defenders in all the\ncases and some instances for the Attackers, indicating complex dynamics. LLEs\nfor all the trials of the Monte Carlo analysis in all the cases revealed the\npresence of chaotic and non-chaotic solutions in each case, respectively, with\nthe majority of the Defenders indicating chaotic behavior. Overall, the swarms\nexist in the 'Edge of chaos', thus revealing complex dynamical behavior. The\nfinal system state (i,e, the outcome of the interaction between the swarms in a\nparticular simulation) is studied for all the cases, which indicated the\npresence of binary final states in some. Finally, to evaluate the complexity of\nindividual swarms, Multiscale Entropy is employed, which revealed a greater\ndegree of randomness for the Defenders when compared to Attackers.\n",

Using Agent-Based Model and a Data\nScience method, we show on simulation results that the discriminatory stance of\nthe agents prevails in most cases. In general, cooperators only appear in\nconditions with low visibility of reputation and a high degree of cooperation\ndemand.

When in\nclose proximity undulatory motion can lead to novel collective behaviors such\nas gait synchronization, spatial reconfiguration, and clustering. Here we study\nthe role of contact interactions between model undulatory swimmers: three-link\nrobots in experiment and multi-link robots in simulation. The undulatory gait\nof each swimmer is generated through a time-dependent sinusoidal-like waveform\nwhich has a fixed phase offset, $\\phi$. By varying the phase relationship\nbetween neighboring swimmers we seek to study how contact forces and spatial\nconfigurations are governed by the phase difference between neighboring\nswimmers. We find that undulatory actuation in close proximity drives\nneighboring swimmers into spatial equilibrium configurations that depend on the\nactuation phase difference. We propose a model for spatial equilibrium of\nnearest neighbor undulatory swimmers which we call the gait compatibility\ncondition, which is the set of spatial and gait configurations in which no\ncollisions occur. Robotic experiments with two, three, and four swimmers\nexhibit good agreement with the compatibility model. To probe the interaction\npotential between undulatory swimmers we perturb the each longitudinally from\ntheir equilibrium configurations and we measure their steady-state\ndisplacement. These studies reveal that undulatory swimmers in close proximity\nexhibit cohesive longitudinal interaction forces that drive the swimmers from\nincompatible to compatible configurations. This system of undulatory swimmers\nprovides new insight into active-matter systems which move through body\nundulation. In addition to the importance of velocity and orientation coherence\nin active-matter swarms, we demonstrate that undulatory phase coherence is also\nimportant for generating stable, cohesive group configurations.\n",

To\nunderstand ozone's spatiotemporal variance, we introduce the eigen microstate\nmethod to analyze the global ozone mass mixing ratio (OMMR) between 1979-01-01\nand 2020-06-30 at 37 pressure layers.

Without deseasonalization, the first eigen microstates capture the\nseasonal effect and reveal that the phase of the intra-annual cycle moves with\nthe geopotential heights. After deseasonalization, by contrast, the collective\npatterns from the overall trend, ENSO, QBO, and tropopause pressure are\nidentified by the first few significant eigen microstates.

Here we construct a matrix perturbation theory of large\ninterconnected power systems that clarifies the origin and the conditions for\nthe emergence of inter-area oscillations. We show that coherent inter-area\noscillations emerge from the zero-modes of a multi-area network Laplacian\nmatrix, which hybridize only weakly with other modes, even under significant\ncapacity of the inter-area tie-lines, i.e. even when the standard assumption of\narea partitioning is not satisfied.

We propose a degenerate parametric\noscillator with nonlinear damping in quantum optics as a quantum\nactivator-inhibitor unit and demonstrate that a system of two\nactivator-inhibitor units can undergo Turing instability when diffusively\ncoupled with each other. The Turing instability induces nonuniformity and\nentanglement between the two units and gives rise to a pair of nonuniform\nstates that are mixed due to quantum noise. Further performing continuous\nmeasurement on the coupled system reveals the nonuniformity caused by the\nTuring instability.

A parameter drift at any instant in one or multiple network nodes can\ndestroy synchrony, causing failure and even collapse in the network\nperformance. We introduced [PRE 95, 062204(2017)] a recovery strategy by\nselective addition of cross-coupling links to save synchrony in the network\nfrom the edge of failure due to parameter mismatch (small or large) in any\nnodes. This concept is extended to 2-layered multiplex networks when the\nemergent synchrony becomes resilient against a small or large parameter\ndrifting. In addition, the stability of the synchronous state is enhanced from\nlocal stability to global stability of synchrony. By the addition of\ncross-coupling, the network revives complete synchrony in all the nodes except\nthe perturbed nodes, which emerges into a type of generalized synchrony with\nall the unperturbed nodes. The generalized synchrony is manifested simply by a\nlinear amplitude response in the state variable(s) of the perturbed node(s) by\na scaling factor proportional to the mismatch. A set of systematic rules has\nbeen derived from the linear flow matrix of the dynamical system representing\nthe nodes dynamics that helps find the connectivity matrix of the\ncross-coupling links. Lyapunov function stability condition is used to\ndetermine the cross-coupling link strength that, in turn, establishes global\nstability of synchrony of the multiplex network. We verify the efficacy of our\nproposed coupling scheme with analytical results and numerical simulations of\ntwo examples of multiplex networks.

We demonstrate that the complex cellular cooperation between\nparenchyma and stroma (immune layer) either in the physiological or in the\npathological case can be related to dynamical patterns of the network.

Outcomes of many, if not all, risk\nsituations hinge on the performance of human groups, such as whether\ngovernments or scientific communities can work effectively. We propose to think\nabout these issues as Collective Intelligence (CI) problems -- of how to\nprocess distributed information effectively. CI is a transdisciplinary research\narea, whose application involves human and animal groups, markets, robotic\nswarms, collections of neurons, and other distributed systems. In this article,\nwe argue that improving CI in human groups can improve general resilience\nagainst a wide variety of risks. We summarize findings from the CI literature\non conditions that improve human group performance, and discuss ways existing\nCI findings may be applied to GCR mitigation. We also suggest several\ndirections for future research at the exciting intersection of these two\nemerging fields.\n",

A paradigmatic model for the study of such phenomena has been the\nKuramoto model. However, considering real oscillations are rarely isochronous\nas a function of energy, it is natural to extend the model by allowing the\nnatural frequencies to vary as a function of some dynamical resource supply.\nBeyond just accounting for a dynamical supply of resources, however,\ncompetition over a \\emph{shared} resource supply is important in a variety of\nbiological systems. In neuronal systems, for example, resource competition\nenables the study of neural activity via fMRI. It is reasonable to expect that\nthis dynamical resource allocation should have consequences for the\nsynchronization behavior of the brain. This paper presents a modified Kuramoto\ndynamics which includes additional dynamical terms that provide a relatively\nsimple model of resource competition among populations of Kuramoto oscillators.\nWe design a mutlilayer system which highlights the impact of the competition\ndynamics, and we show that in this designed system, correlations can arise\nbetween the synchronization states of two populations of oscillators which\nshare no phase-coupling edges. These correlations are interesting in light of\nthe often observed variance between functional and structural connectivity\nmeasures in real systems. The model presented here then suggests that some of\nthe observed discrepancy may be explained by the way in which the brain\ndynamically allocates resources to different regions according to demand. If\ntrue, models such as this one provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the\ndifferences between structural and functional measures, and possibly implicate\ndynamical resource allocation as an integral part of the neural computation\nprocess.\n",

Previous experimental studies have reported a route from\nlow amplitude chaotic oscillation (i. e. combustion noise) to periodic\noscillations through intermittency in turbulent combustors.

An enhancement of amplitude death regions (i.e., an\nincrement of the width of the amplitude death regions along the control\nparameter axis) can be possible using the occasional coupling in a pair of\ndelay-coupled oscillators. Our study starts with coupled limit cycle\noscillators (Stuart-Landau) and coupled chaotic oscillators (R\\\"ossler). We\nfurther examine coupled horizontal Rijke tubes, a prototypical model of\nthermoacoustic systems. Oscillatory states are highly detrimental to\nthermoacoustic systems such as combustors. Consequently, a state of amplitude\ndeath is always preferred. We employ the on-off coupling (i.e., a square wave\nfunction), as an occasional coupling scheme, to these coupled oscillators. On\nmonotonically varying the coupling strength (as a control parameter), we\nobserve an enhancement of amplitude death regions using the occasional coupling\nscheme compared to the continuous coupling scheme. In order to study the\ncontribution of the occasional coupling scheme, we perform a detailed linear\nstability analysis and analytically explain this enhancement of the amplitude\ndeath region for coupled limit cycle oscillators. We also adopt the frequency\nratio of the oscillators and the time delay between the oscillators as the\ncontrol parameters. Intriguingly, we obtain a similar enhancement of the\namplitude death regions using frequency ratio and time delay as the control\nparameters in the presence of the occasional coupling. Finally, we use a\nhalf-wave rectified sinusoidal wave function (motivated by practical reality)\nto introduce the occasional coupling in time-delay coupled oscillators and get\nsimilar results.\n",

Although the model reproduced the\ndisorders' aggregated temporal evolution, it could not deliver results\nresembling the observed spatial distribution of activity on Santiago.

Individual neurons are described by the Ermentrout-Kopell\ncanonical model that can be excitable or tonically spiking, and interact with\nother neurons via pulses. Utilizing the equivalence of the quadratic integrate-\nand-fire and the theta neuron formulations, we first derive the dynamical\nequations in terms of the Kuramoto-Daido order parameters (Fourier modes of the\nphase distribution) and relate them to two biophysically relevant macroscopic\nobservables, the firing rate and the mean voltage. For neurons driven by Cauchy\nwhite noise or for Cauchy-Lorentz distributed input currents, we adapt the\nresults by Cestnik and Pikovsky [arXiv:2207.02302 (2022)] and show that for\narbitrary initial conditions the collective dynamics reduces to six dimensions.\nWe also prove that in this case the dynamics asymptotically converges to a\ntwo-dimensional invariant manifold first discovered by Ott and Antonsen. For\nidentical, noise-free neurons, the dynamics reduces to three dimensions,\nbecoming equivalent to the Watanabe-Strogatz description. We illustrate the\nexact six-dimensional dynamics outside the invariant manifold by calculating\nnontrivial basins of different asymptotic regimes in a bistable situation.\n",

The ability of the\nnetwork to adapt coupling strengths between units in accordance with their\nactivity arises naturally in a variety of contexts, including neural plasticity\nin the brain, and adds an additional layer of complexity: the dynamics on the\nnodes influence the dynamics of the network and vice versa. We study a minimal\nmodel of Kuramoto phase oscillators including a general adaptive learning rule\nwith three parameters (strength of adaptivity, adaptivity offset, adaptivity\nshift), mimicking learning paradigms based on spike-time-dependent-plasticity\n(STDP). Importantly, the strength of adaptivity allows to tune the system away\naway from the limit of the classical Kuramoto model, corresponding to\nstationary coupling strengths and no adaptation, and thus, to systematically\nstudy the impact of adaptivity on the collective dynamics. We carry out a\ndetailed bifurcation analysis for the minimal model consisting of N = 2\noscillators. The non-adaptive Kuramoto model exhibits very simple dynamic\nbehavior, drift or frequency-locking; but once the strength of adaptivity\nexceeds a critical threshold non-trivial bifurcation structures unravel: A\nsymmetric adaptation rule results in multi-stability and bifurcation scenarios,\nand an asymmetric adaptation rule generates even more intriguing and rich\ndynamics, including a period doubling-cascade to chaos as well as oscillations\ndisplaying features of both librations and rotations simultaneously. Generally,\nadaptation improves the synchronizability of the oscillators.

Associative learning has been\nwidely studied in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, but are most\ncommonly implemented in highly complex or carefully engineered systems such as\nanimal brains, artificial neural networks, DNA computing systems and gene\nregulatory networks. The ability to encode environmental correlations and use\nthem to make predictions is a benchmark of biological resilience, and underpins\na plethora of adaptive responses in the living hierarchy, spanning prey animal\nspecies anticipating the arrival of predators, to epigenetic systems in\nmicroorganisms learning environmental correlations. Given the ubiquitous and\nessential presence of learning behaviours in the biosphere, we aimed to explore\nwhether simple, non-living dissipative structures could also exhibit\nassociative learning. Inspired by previous modeling of associative learning in\nchemical networks, we simulated simple systems composed of long and short term\nmemory chemical species that could encode the presence or absence of temporal\ncorrelations between two external species. The ability to learn this\nassociation was implemented in Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion spots, emergent\nchemical patterns that exhibit self-replication and homeostasis. With the novel\nability of associative learning, we demonstrate that simple chemical patterns\ncan exhibit a broad repertoire of life-like behaviour, paving the way for in\nvitro studies of autonomous chemical learning systems, with potential relevance\nto artificial life, origins of life, and systems chemistry. The experimental\nrealisation of these learning behaviours in protocell systems could advance a\nnovel research direction in astrobiology, since our system significantly\nreduces the lower bound on the required complexity for emergent learning.\n",

While power grids are designed to damp most of\nperturbations during standard operations, some of them can excite normal modes\nof the system and cause significant energy transfers across the system,\ncreating large oscillations thousands of miles away from the source.\nLocalization of the source of such disturbances remains an outstanding\nchallenge due to a limited knowledge of the system parameters outside of the\nzone of responsibility of system operators.

We illustrate the validity of the algorithm on a\nvariety of examples where forcing leads to resonance conditions in the system\ndynamics.

In this context, most\nof the previous studies have been done either on temporal pairwise networks or\non static simplicial complexes. Here, for the first time, we propose a general\nframework to study the synchronization phenomenon in temporal simplicial\ncomplexes. We show that the synchronous state exists as an invariant solution\nand obtain the necessary condition for it to be emerged as a stable state in\nfast switching regime. We prove that the time-averaged simplicial complex plays\nthe role of synchronization indicator whenever the switching among simplicial\ntopologies are adequately fast. We attempt to transform the stability problem\ninto a master stability function form. Unfortunately, for the general\ncircumstances, the dimension reduction of the master stability equation is\ncumbersome due to the presence of group interactions. However, we overcome this\ndifficulty in two interesting situations based on either the functional forms\nof the coupling schemes or the connectivity structure of the simplicial\ncomplex, and demonstrate that the necessary condition mimics the form of a\nmaster stability function in these cases. We verify our analytical findings by\napplying them on synthetic and real-world networked systems.

The coupling effect results from the fact that the local\nconcentration of the mediating chemical affects both its production and\nabsorption by each oscillator. Since the chemical diffuses through the medium\nin which the oscillators are embedded, the coupling among oscillators is\nnon-local: it considers all the oscillators depending on their relative spatial\ndistances. We considered a mathematical model for this coupling, when the\ndiffusion time is arbitrary with respect to the characteristic oscillator\nperiods, yielding a system of coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations\nwhich can be solved using Green functions for appropriate boundary conditions.\nIn this paper we show numerical solutions of these equations for three finite\ndomains: a linear one-dimensional interval, a rectangular, and a circular\nregion, with absorbing boundary conditions. From the numerical solutions we\ninvestigate phase and frequency synchronization of the oscillators, with\nrespect to changes in the coupling parameters for the three considered\ngeometries.\n",

It is known as a chimera state. We study chimera states in\na network consisting of six populations of identical Kuramoto-Sakaguchi phase\noscillators. The populations are arranged in a ring and oscillators belonging\nto one population are uniformly coupled to all oscillators within the same\npopulation and to those in the two neighboring populations. This topology\nsupports the existence of different configurations of coherent and incoherent\npopulations along the ring, but all of them are linearly unstable in most of\nthe parameter space. Yet, chimera dynamics is observed from random initial\nconditions in a wide parameter range, characterized by one incoherent and five\nsynchronized populations. These observable states are connected to the\nformation of a heteroclinic cycle between symmetric variants of saddle\nchimeras, which gives rise to a switching dynamics. We analyze the dynamical\nand spectral properties of the chimeras in the thermodynamic limit using the\nOtt-Antonsen ansatz, and in finite-sized systems employing Watanabe-Strogatz\nreduction. For a heterogeneous frequency distribution, a small heterogeneity\nrenders a heteroclinic switching dynamics asymptotically attracting. However,\nfor a large heterogeneity, the heteroclinic orbit does not survive; instead, it\nis replaced by a variety of attracting chimera states.\n",

The cost exponent\n$\\gamma$ tunes the vessel growth in the adaptation rule, and we test the\nhypothesis that the cost exponent is $\\gamma=1/2$ for vascular systems [Hu and\nCai, Phys. Rev.

One recent\nextension of the model replaces the oscillators, originally characterized by a\nsingle phase, by particles with D-1 internal phases, represented by a point on\nthe surface of the unit D-sphere. Particles are then more easily represented by\nD-dimensional unit vectors than by D-1 spherical angles. However, numerical\nintegration of the state equations should ensure that the propagated vectors\nremain unit and that particles rotate on the sphere as predicted by the\ndynamical equations. As discussed in [1] integration of the three-dimensional\nKuramoto model using Euler's method with time step $\\Delta t$ not only changes\nthe norm of the vectors but produces a small rotation of the particles around\nthe wrong axis. Importantly, the error in the axis' direction does not vanish\nin the limit $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$. Therefore, instead of displacing the\nunit vectors in the direction of the velocity one should performed a sequence\nof direct small rotations, as dictated by the equations of motion. This keeps\nthe particles on the sphere at all times, ensuring exact norm preservation, and\nrotates the particles around the proper axis for small $\\Delta t$ [1]. Here I\npropose an alternative way to do such integration by rotations in 3D that can\nbe generalized to more dimensions using Cayley-Hamilton's theorem. Explicit\nformulas are provided for 2, 3 and 4 dimensions. I also compare the results\nwith the forth order Runge-Kutta method, which seems to provide accurate\nresults even requiring renormalization of the vectors after each integration\nstep.\n",

A moment closure consists of a set of\napproximations that express certain higher-order moments in terms of\nlower-order ones, so that applying those leads to a closed system of equations\nfor only the lower-order moments. Closures are frequently found drawing on\nintuition and heuristics to come up with quantitatively good approximations.

Our\nfindings reveal the existence of various synchronized states, including splay\nand cluster states, a partially synchronized state such as chimeric\nquasiperiodicity, and an oscillation quenching state such as amplitude death in\nthese networks. Moreover, through an analysis of long-lived transients, we\ndiscover novel amplitude-modulated states within ring networks. Interestingly,\nwe observe that increasing nonlocality diminishes the influence of the number\nof oscillators on the overall behavior in these networks. Furthermore, we note\nthat chain networks, unlike ring networks, do not exhibit perfect synchrony\namong the coupled oscillators. In contrast, star networks demonstrate greater\nstability and are unaffected by the number of oscillators within the network.\nThe insights from this study deepen our understanding of the dynamics of\nminimal networks and have implications for various fields, ranging from biology\nto engineering.\n",

Please refer to the PRX version\nfrom now on.\n  Anna B\\\"uttner and Frank Hellmann. \"Complex Couplings-A Universal, Adaptive,\nand Bilinear Formulation of Power Grid Dynamics.\"\n  The energy transition introduces new classes of dynamical actors into the\npower grid. There is a growing need for so-called grid-forming inverters (GFIs)\nthat can contribute to dynamic grid stability as the share of synchronous\ngenerators decreases. Understanding the collective behavior and stability of\nfuture grids, featuring a heterogeneous mix of dynamics, remains an urgent and\nchallenging task. Two recent advances in describing such modern power grid\ndynamics have made this problem more tractable: First, the normal form for\ngrid-forming actors provides a uniform, technology-neutral description of\nplausible grid dynamics, including grid-forming inverters and synchronous\nmachines. Secondly, the notion of the complex frequency has been introduced to\neffortlessly describe how the nodal dynamics influence the power flows in the\ngrid. The major contribution of this paper is to show how the normal form\napproach and the complex frequency dynamics of power grids combine, and how\nthey relate naturally to adaptive dynamical networks and control affine\nsystems. Using normal form and complex frequency, we derive a remarkably\nelementary and universal equation for the collective grid dynamics. Notably, we\nobtain an elegant equation entirely in terms of a matrix of complex couplings,\nin which the network topology does not explicitly appear. These complex\ncouplings give rise to new adaptive network formulations of future power grid\ndynamics. We give a new formulation of the Kuramoto model with inertia as a\nspecial case.\n",

The dictator's dilemma is\nessential to most autocratic regimes and is one of the key features in the\nliterature on the subject. Yet, no quantitative theory of how the distortion of\ninformation develops from the initial state has been developed up to date. I\npresent a model of the appearance and evolution of such information distortion,\nwith subsequent degradation of control by the dictator. The model is based on\nthe following fundamental and general premises: a) the dictator governs aiming\nto follow the desired trajectory of development based only on the information\nfrom the advisors; b) the deception from the advisors cannot decrease in time;\nand c) the deception change depends on the difficulties the country encounters.\nThe model shows effective control in the short term (a few months to a year),\nfollowed by instability leading to the country's gradual deterioration of the\nstate over many years. I derive some universal parameters applicable to all\ndictators and show that advisors' deception increases parallel with the decline\nof the control.

By performing an averaging approximation, we obtain a\nphase diagram for the in-phase synchronization, anti-phase synchronization, and\noscillation quenching. We also numerically integrate the equation of motion and\nconfirm the agreement between the analytical and numerical results. Despite the\nsimplicity, our model successfully reproduces essential phenomena in\ninteracting mechanical clocks, such as the bistability of in-phase and\nanti-phase synchrony and oscillation quenching occurring for a large mass ratio\nbetween the oscillator and the platform. We believe that our simple model will\ncontribute to future analyses of other dynamics observed in metronomes.\n",

We argue that, although diffusive\ncoupling both facilitates and impedes escape, the facilitating effect is\ndominant when coupling is weak. For weak coupling cases, we develop an\napproximate theory that can predict the mean and variance of escape times.

The presence of spatial\nstructure complicates the determination of which measurements should be used\nfor accurate phase calculation. To address this, we explore a method for\ncalculating the phase from the time series of measurements taken at a single\nspatial grid point. The phase is calculated to increase linearly between event\ntimes when the measurement time series intersects the Poincar\\'e section. The\ndifference between the calculated phase and the isochron-based phase, resulting\nfrom the discrepancy between the isochron and the Poincar\\'e section, is\nevaluated using a linear approximation near the limit-cycle solution.

Phase reduction theory serves as a useful analytical framework for\nelucidating the synchronization mechanism of these oscillators. Essentially,\nthis theory describes the dynamics of a multi-dimensional nonlinear oscillator\nusing a single variable called asymptotic phase. In order to understand and\ncontrol the rhythmic phenomena in the real world, it is crucial to estimate the\nasymptotic phase from the observed data. In this study, we propose a new\nmethod, Gaussian Process Phase Interpolation (GPPI), for estimating the\nasymptotic phase from time series data. The GPPI method first evaluates the\nasymptotic phase on the limit cycle and subsequently estimates the asymptotic\nphase outside the limit cycle employing Gaussian process regression. Thanks to\nthe high expressive power of Gaussian processes, the GPPI is capable of\ncapturing a variety of functions. Furthermore, it is easily applicable even\nwhen the dimension of the system increases. The performance of the GPPI is\ntested by using simulation data from the Stuart-Landau oscillator and the\nHodgkin-Huxley oscillator. The results demonstrate that the GPPI can accurately\nestimate the asymptotic phase even in the presence of high observation noise\nand strong nonlinearity. Additionally, the GPPI is demonstrated as an effective\ntool for data-driven phase control of a Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator.

Limbs may move alternatively on their own, which implies that\ninterlimb coordination must be mediated either by the body or via decentralized\ninter-limb signaling. In this case, when embodiment is present, two types of\ncontrollers are conceivable for the actuators of the limbs, local pacemaker\ncircuits and control principles based on self-organized embodiment. The latter,\nself-organized control, is based on limit cycles and chaotic attractors that\nemerge within the feedback loop composed of controller, body, and environment.\nFor this to happen, the sensorimotor loop must be locally closed, e.g. via\npropriosensation. Here we review the progress made within the framework of\nself-organized embodiment, with a particular focus on the concept of\nattractoring.

To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic\nthermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small\nsystem, emsemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to\ncharacterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a\nmodel for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an\napproximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in\ntrajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the time development\nof the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and\nverify the analytical results by numerical simulations.\n",

However, current models often neglect higher-order interactions\n(beyond pairwise interactions) and diverse adaptation types (cooperative and\ncompetitive) commonly observed in systems like the human brain and social\nnetworks. This work addresses this gap by incorporating these factors into a\nmodel that explores their impact on collective properties like synchronization.\nThrough simplified network representations, we investigate how the simultaneous\npresence of cooperative and competitive adaptations influences phase\ntransitions. Our findings reveal a transition from first-order to second-order\nsynchronization as the strength of higher-order interactions increases under\ncompetitive adaptation. We also demonstrate the possibility of synchronization\neven without pairwise interactions, provided there is strong enough\nhigher-order coupling. When only competitive adaptations are present, the\nsystem exhibits second-order-like phase transitions and clustering. Conversely,\nwith a combination of cooperative and competitive adaptations, the system\nundergoes a first-order-like phase transition, characterized by a sharp\ntransition to the synchronized state without reverting to an incoherent state\nduring backward transitions. The specific nature of these second-order-like\ntransitions varies depending on the coupling strengths and mean degrees. With\nour model, we can control not only when the system synchronizes but also the\nway the system goes to synchronization.\n",

Despite ongoing advances, a fully understanding of the\ngenesis of chimera states remains challenging. This work formalizes a\nsystematic method by evoking pattern formation theory to explain the emergence\nof chimera states in complex networks, in a similar way to how Turing patterns\nare produced. Employing linear stability analysis and the spectral properties\nof complex networks, we show that the randomness of network topology, as\nreflected in the localization of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors, determines\nthe emergence of chimera patterns, underscoring the critical role of network\nstructure. In particular, this approach explains how amplitude and phase\nchimeras arise separately and explores whether phase chimeras can be chaotic or\nnot. Our findings suggest that chimeras result from the interplay between local\nand global dynamics at different time scales. Validated through simulations and\nempirical network analyses, our method enriches the understanding of coupled\noscillator dynamics.\n",

Two fundamental features of stem cell\nsystems - stochastic differentiation of stem cells and the robustness of a\nsystem due to regulation of this differentiation - are found to be general\nproperties of a system of interacting cells exhibiting chaotic intra-cellular\nreaction dynamics and cell division, whose presence does not depend on the\ndetail of the model. It is found that stem cells differentiate into other cell\ntypes stochastically due to a dynamical instability caused by cell-cell\ninteractions, in a manner described by the Isologous Diversification theory.\nThis developmental process is shown to be stable not only with respect to\nmolecular fluctuations but also with respect to removal of cells. With this\ndevelopmental process, the irreversible loss of multipotency accompanying the\nchange from a stem cell to a differentiated cell is shown to be characterized\nby a decrease in the chemical diversity in the cell and of the complexity of\nthe cellular dynamics. The relationship between the division speed and this\nloss of multipotency is also discussed. Using our model, some predictions that\ncan be tested experimentally are made for a stem cell system.\n",

To demonstrate this theory, a\ndynamical systems model consisting of the concentrations of metabolites,\nenzymes, amino acyl tRNA synthetase, and tRNA-amino acid complex in a cell is\nintroduced and numerically studied. It is shown that the biochemical states of\ncells are differentiated by cell-cell interaction, and each differentiated type\ntakes to use different synthetase.

According\nto the theory, phenotypes of organisms are first differentiated into distinct\ntypes through the interaction and developmental dynamics, even though they have\nidentical genotypes, and later with the mutation in genotype, the genotype also\ndifferentiates into discrete types, while maintaining the `symbiotic'\nrelationship between the types.

The set of\nspecies present undergoes long-term evolution due to speciation and extinction\nevents. We summarize results obtained on the macro-evolutionary dynamics of\nspeciations and extinctions, and on the statistical properties of the food webs\nthat are generated by the model. Simulations begin from small numbers of\nspecies and build up to larger webs with relatively constant species number on\naverage. The rate of origination and extinction of species are relatively high,\nbut remain roughly balanced throughout the simulations.

The chance of the child species surviving is significantly\nhigher if the parent is on the second or third trophic level than if it is on\nthe first level, most likely due to a wider choice of possible prey for species\non higher levels. Addition of a new species sometimes causes extinction of\nexisting species. The parent species has a high probability of extinction\nbecause it has strong competition with the new species.

Biological quantum computation could have provided evolutionary\nadvantages in the area of decision-making and fast motor responses, when a\nnumber of potential actions -represented as a set of points in a high\ndimensional state-space- are available to the agent. While for animals and\nearly humans these rapid, coordinated motor activities had direct survival\nvalue, today they are mostly manifested in competitive sports events.

First, phenotypes\nof individuals with identical genotypes split into a few groups, according to\ninstability in the developmental dynamics that are triggered with the\ncompetitive interaction among individuals. Then, through mutational change of\ngenes, the phenotypic differences are fixed to genes, until the groups are\ncompletely separated in genes as well as phenotypes. It is also demonstrated\nthat the proposed theory leads to hybrid sterility under sexual recombination,\nand thus speciation is completed in the sense of reproductive isolation. As a\nresult of this post-mating isolation, the mating preference evolves later. When\nthere are two alleles, the correlation between alleles is formed, to\nconsolidate the speciation. When individuals are located in space, different\nspecies are later segregated spatially, implying that the speciation so far\nregarded to be allopatric may be a result of sympatric speciation.\nRelationships with previous theories, frequency-dependent selection,\nreinforcement, Baldwin's effect, phenotypic plasticity, and resource\ncompetition are briefly discussed. Relevance of the results to natural\nevolution are discussed, including punctuated equilibrium, incomplete\npenetrance in mutants, and the change in flexibility in genotype-phenotype\ncorrespondence. Finally, it is discussed how our theory is confirmed both in\nfield and in laboratory (in an experiment with the use of E coli.).\n",

These maps are selected from the complex\nplane according to \"best fit\" scoring criteria with the data. The embedding\ntopology within and near the familiar Mandelbrot Set provides metrics which are\nused to aid in clustering similarities (synchronization) between these selected\npoint models.

Consistent with some\ncurrent theories of macroevolutionary dynamics, the model displays\nintermittent, statistically self-similar behavior with punctuated equilibria.\nThe probability density for the lifetimes of ecological communities is well\napproximated by a power law with exponent near -2, and the corresponding power\nspectral densities show 1/f noise (flicker noise) over several decades. The\nlong-lived communities (quasi-steady states) consist of a relatively small\nnumber of mutualistically interacting species, and they are surrounded by a\n``protection zone'' of closely related genotypes that have a very low\nprobability of invading the resident community. The extent of the protection\nzone affects the stability of the community in a way analogous to the height of\nthe free-energy barrier surrounding a metastable state in a physical system.\nMeasures of biological diversity are on average stationary with no discernible\ntrends, even over our very long simulation runs of approximately 3.4x10^7\ngenerations.\n",

Then, we establish a relation between the\ncross-sectional areas of adjoining channels at each junction. Indeed, this\nrelation is a generalization of Murray's law, originally established in the\ncontext of local optimization. Moreover, we establish a relation between angles\nand cross-sectional areas of adjoining channels at each junction, which can be\nrepresented as a vectorial force balance equation, where the force weight\ndepends on the channel cross-sectional area.

The long-range\njump probability plays the role of the small-world disorder. We show that there\nis an optimal value of this probability, for which the segregation process is\nfastest. Moreover, above a critical probability, the time needed to reach a\nfully segregated state diverges for asymptotically large systems. These special\nvalues of the long-range jump probability depend crucially on the particle\ndensity. Our system is a novel example of the rare dynamical processes with\ncritical behaviour at a finite value of the small-world disorder.\n",

Several efforts have been made to deal with\nthis complexity using the concept of self-organization. However, in order to\npromote its use and understanding, we must first have a pragmatic understanding\nof complexity and self-organization. This paper presents a conceptual framework\nfor speaking about self-organizing systems. The aim is to provide a methodology\nuseful for designing and controlling systems developed to solve complex\nproblems. First, practical notions of complexity and self-organization are\ngiven. Then, starting from the agent metaphor, a conceptual framework is\npresented. This provides formal ways of speaking about \"satisfaction\" of\nelements and systems. The main premise of the methodology claims that reducing\nthe \"friction\" or \"interference\" of interactions between elements of a system\nwill result in a higher \"satisfaction\" of the system, i.e. better performance.\nThe methodology discusses different ways in which this can be achieved. A case\nstudy on self-organizing traffic lights illustrates the ideas presented in the\npaper.\n",

Moreover, there is no strict distinction between alive and dead;\none can only infer that a protocell was alive if it replicates. These features\nof early life render natural selection inapplicable to the description of its\nchange-of-state because they defy its underlying assumptions. Moreover, natural\nselection describes only randomly generated novelty; it cannot describe the\nemergence of form at the interface between organism and environment.\nSelf-organization is also inadequate because it is restricted to interactions\namongst parts; it too cannot account for context-driven change. A modified\nversion of selection theory or self-organization would not work because the\ndescription of change-of-state through interaction with an incompletely\nspecified context has a completely different mathematical structure, i.e.\nentails a non-Kolmogorovian probability model. It is proposed that the\nevolution of early life is appropriately described as lineage transformation\nthrough context-driven actualization of potential (CAP), with self-organized\nchange-of-state being a special case of no contextual influence, and\ncompetitive exclusion of less fit individuals through a selection-like process\npossibly (but not necessarily) playing a secondary role.

We then consider neuron couplings, with a brief\ndescription of synapses, synaptic plasticiy and learning, in a second section.\nWe also briefly discuss the delicate issue of causal action from one neuron to\nanother when complex feedback effects and non linear dynamics are involved. The\nthird section presents the limit of weak coupling and the use of normal forms\ntechnics to handle this situation. We consider then several examples of\nrecurrent models with different type of synaptic interactions (symmetric,\ncooperative, random). We introduce various techniques coming from statistical\nphysics and dynamical systems theory. A last section is devoted to a detailed\nexample of recurrent model where we go in deep in the analysis of the dynamics\nand discuss the effect of learning on the neuron dynamics. We also present\nrecent methods allowing the analysis of the non linear effects of the neural\ndynamics on signal propagation and causal action.

Subsequently, adding\nelectrostatic forces to the geodesic moment equations relates them to the\nBenney equations and to the equations for beam dynamics in particle\naccelerators. Next, we develop a kinetic theory for self assembly in\nnano-particles. Darcy's law is introduced as a general principle for\naggregation dynamics in friction dominated systems (at different scales). Then,\na kinetic equation is introduced for the dissipative motion of isotropic\nnano-particles. The zeroth-moment dynamics of this equation recovers the\nclassical Darcy's law at the macroscopic level. A kinetic-theory description\nfor oriented nano-particles is also presented. At the macroscopic level, the\nzeroth moments of this kinetic equation recover the magnetization dynamics of\nthe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The moment equations exhibit the\nspontaneous emergence of singular solutions (clumpons) that finally merge in\none singularity. This behaviour represents aggregation and alignment of\noriented nano-particles. Finally, the Smoluchowski description is derived from\nthe dissipative Vlasov equation for anisotropic interactions.

In particular, two adaptive schemes are\ndiscussed and compared in the context of Boolean Networks and Threshold\nNetworks: 1) Active nodes loose links, frozen nodes aquire new links, 2) Nodes\nwith correlated activity connect, de-correlated nodes disconnect. These simple\nlocal adaptive rules lead to co-evolution of network topology and -dynamics.\nAdaptive networks are strikingly different from random networks: They evolve\ninhomogeneous topologies and broad plateaus of homeostatic regulation,\ndynamical activity exhibits $1/f$ noise and attractor periods obey a scale-free\ndistribution.

A common formalism to approach QS is the\nreplicator-mutator equation (RME). However, a problem with the RME is how to\nquantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants. Here, this is\naddressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche\ntheory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of\nresources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing\nindividuals (the different viral variants that constitute the QS). Using this\nnovel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping, for\ndescribing QS, we explore the population distributions of viral variants that\nemerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics. We observe that the population\ndistribution requires very long transients both to A) reach equilibrium and B)\nto show a clear dominating master sequence. Based on different independent and\nrecent experimental evidence, we find that when some cooperation or\nfacilitation between variants is included in appropriate doses we can solve\nboth A) and B). We show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of\ncooperation is the Shannon entropy. Therefore, in order to get a typical\nquasispecies profile, it seems that pure competition is not enough. Rather,\nsome degree of cooperation among viral variants is needed. This has several\nbiological implications that might contribute to shed light on the mechanisms\noperating in QS dynamics and to understand the QS as a whole entity.\n",

        "summary": "  Many problems in evolutionary theory are cast in dyadic terms, such as the\npolar oppositions of organism and environment. We argue that a triadic\nconceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the\ninformation generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,\nand propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply\ninfluenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,\nwe elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and\nmodern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions\nto the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures\ninvolve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,\nformal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles\nas primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of\nthermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are\nsystems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this\nview, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy\nProduction work together to drive the emergence of information carrying\nstructures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the\ngradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's\nseminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical\nexpression of the Second Law.\n",

These rules define an adaptive\nnetwork on which the agent's opinions coevolve with the network topology of\nsocial contacts. We show analytically and numerically that nonequilibrium phase\ntransitions occur as a function of the rewiring strength. The transitions\nseparate four distinct phases which differ in the observed dynamics of opinions\nand topology. In particular, there is one phase where the population settles to\nan arbitrary consensus opinion.

The process of rewiring is described in terms of two basic\nactions: disconnection and reconnection between nodes, both based on a\nmechanism of comparison of their states. We assume that the process of rewiring\nand node state change occur with probabilities Pr and Pc respectively,\nindependent of each other.

Generating disequilibrium in a thermodynamic\nvariable requires the extraction of power from another thermodynamic gradient,\nand the second law of thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on how much\npower can be extracted. When applied to complex earth system processes, where\nseveral irreversible processes compete to deplete the same gradients, it is\neasily shown that the maximum thermodynamic efficiency is much less than the\nclassic Carnot limit, so that the ability of the earth system to generate power\nand disequilibrium is limited. This approach is used to quantify how much free\nenergy is generated by various earth system processes to generate chemical\ndisequilibrium. It is shown that surface life generates orders of magnitude\nmore chemical free energy than any abiotic surface process, therefore being the\nprimary driving force for shaping the geochemical environment at the planetary\nscale. To apply this perspective to the possible future of the planet, we first\nnote that the free energy consumption by human activity is a considerable term\nin the free energy budget of the planet, and that global changes are closely\nrelated to this consumption of free energy. Since human activity and demands\nfor free energy is going to increase in the future, the central question is how\nhuman free energy demands can increase sustainably without negatively impacting\nthe ability of the earth system to generate free energy.

We test a self-organizing method in our model, showing\nthat it is close to theoretical optima and superior to a traditional method of\ntraffic light coordination.\n  Abstract: The elementary cellular automaton following rule 184 can mimic\nparticles flowing in one direction at a constant speed. This automaton can\ntherefore model highway traffic. In a recent paper, we have incorporated\nintersections regulated by traffic lights to this model using exclusively\nelementary cellular automata. In such a paper, however, we only explored a\nrectangular grid. We now extend our model to more complex scenarios employing\nan hexagonal grid. This extension shows first that our model can readily\nincorporate multiple-way intersections and hence simulate complex scenarios. In\naddition, the current extension allows us to study and evaluate the behavior of\ntwo different kinds of traffic light controller for a grid of six-way streets\nallowing for either two or three street intersections: a traffic light that\ntries to adapt to the amount of traffic (which results in self-organizing\ntraffic lights) and a system of synchronized traffic lights with coordinated\nrigid periods (sometimes called the \"green wave\" method). We observe a tradeoff\nbetween system capacity and topological complexity. The green wave method is\nunable to cope with the complexity of a higher-capacity scenario, while the\nself-organizing method is scalable, adapting to the complexity of a scenario\nand exploiting its maximum capacity. Additionally, in this paper we propose a\nbenchmark, independent of methods and models, to measure the performance of a\ntraffic light controller comparing it against a theoretical optimum.\n",

Based on the `covariant force law', the general humanoid's\ndynamics and control are developed. Autonomous Lagrangian dynamics is\nformulated on the associated `humanoid velocity phase space', while autonomous\nHamiltonian dynamics is formulated on the associated `humanoid momentum phase\nspace'. Neural-like hierarchical humanoid control naturally follows this\ngeometrical prescription. This purely rotational and autonomous dynamics and\ncontrol is then generalized into the framework of modern non-autonomous\nbiomechanics, defining the Hamiltonian fitness function. The paper concludes\nwith several simulation examples.\n  Keywords: Humanoid robots, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, neural-like\nhumanoid control, time-dependent biodynamics\n",

When the delays are homogeneous throughout the network, the network\nsynchronizes to a time-dependent state [Atay et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,\n144101 (2004)], which may be periodic or chaotic depending on the delay; when\nthe delays are sufficiently heterogeneous, the synchronization proceeds to a\nsteady-state, which is unstable for the uncoupled map [Masoller and Marti,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 94, 134102 (2005)]. Here we characterize the transition from\ntime-dependent to steady-state synchronization as the width of the delay\ndistribution increases. We also compare the two transitions to synchronization\nas the coupling strength increases. We use transition probabilities calculated\nvia symbolic analysis and ordinal patterns. We find that, as the coupling\nstrength increases, before the onset of steady-state synchronization the\nnetwork splits into two clusters which are in anti-phase relation with each\nother. On the other hand, with increasing delay heterogeneity, no cluster\nformation is seen at the onset of steady-state synchronization; however, a\nrather complex unsynchronized state is detected, revealed by a diversity of\ntransition probabilities in the network nodes.\n",

The network structure,\ndescribing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize\nthe behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not\ncontinuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email,\ntext messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or\npractically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for\nnon-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at\nhospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals\nis on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the\ntemporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems\ninteracting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of\npatients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we\npresent the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for\nanalyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their\nrelation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional\nnetwork theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when\nthings happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself.\nSince fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not\nnecessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite\ndifferent from those for static networks.\n",

Social networks are intuitive examples of this organization with\ncliques or clusters of friends being interconnected, but each person is really\nonly 5-6 people away from anyone else.

The production of large\nmolecules, as we know it today, requires good catalysts, and the only good\ncatalysts we know that can accomplish this task consist of large molecules.\nThus the origin of large molecules is a chicken and egg problem in chemistry.\nHere we present a mechanism, based on autocatalytic sets (ACSs), that is a\npossible solution to this problem. We discuss a mathematical model describing\nthe population dynamics of molecules in a stylized but prebiotically plausible\nchemistry. Large molecules can be produced in this chemistry by the coalescing\nof smaller ones, with the smallest molecules, the `food set', being buffered.\nSome of the reactions can be catalyzed by molecules within the chemistry with\nvarying catalytic strengths. Normally the concentrations of large molecules in\nsuch a scenario are very small, diminishing exponentially with their size.\nACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the resources of the\nsystem into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a bistability in the\npopulation dynamics and, in particular, steady states wherein the ACS molecules\ndominate the population. However to reach these steady states from initial\nconditions that contain only the food set typically requires very large\ncatalytic strengths, growing exponentially with the size of the catalyst\nmolecule. We present a solution to this problem by studying `nested ACSs', a\nstructure in which a small ACS is connected to a larger one and reinforces it.\nWe show that when the network contains a cascade of nested ACSs with the\ncatalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with their size (e.g., as\na power law), a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules\ncan come to dominate the system.\n",

The methods we use apply beyond the Kuramoto model and we\ndevelop here the case of active rotator models, that is the case in which the\ndynamics of each rotator in absence of interaction and noise is not simply a\nrotation.\n",

Organization is a progressive change, while evolution is\nexpressed in the effects of accumulating marks acquired from contingent\nencounters. Co-existence of the system in states of maximum organization as\nwell as maximum action forms the core idea of the paper. Major influences have\nbeen drawn from the Principle of Least Action. This allows us to see how this\nmost basic law of physics determines the development of the system towards\nstates with less action i.e. organized states. Based on this, it has been\nproposed, that the development of a system towards states of greater\norganization is cyclic in nature and thus evolution is a cyclic process.\n",

        "summary": "  Adaptation to changing environments is a hallmark of biological systems.\nDiversity in traits is necessary for adaptation and can influence the survival\nof a population faced with novelty. In habitats that remain stable over many\ngenerations, stabilizing selection reduces trait differences within\npopulations, thereby appearing to remove the diversity needed for heritable\nadaptive responses in new environments. Paradoxically, field studies have\ndocumented numerous populations under long periods of stabilizing selection and\nevolutionary stasis that have rapidly evolved under changed environmental\nconditions. In this article, we review how cryptic genetic variation (CGV)\nresolves this diversity paradox by allowing populations in a stable environment\nto gradually accumulate hidden genetic diversity that is revealed as trait\ndifferences when environments change. Instead of being in conflict,\nenvironmental stasis supports CGV accumulation and thus appears to facilitate\nrapid adaptation in new environments as suggested by recent CGV studies.\nSimilarly, degeneracy has been found to support both genetic and non-genetic\nadaptation at many levels of biological organization. Degenerate, as opposed to\ndiverse or redundant, ensembles appear functionally redundant in certain\nenvironmental contexts but functionally diverse in others. CGV and degeneracy\nparadigms for adaptation are integrated in this review, revealing a common set\nof principles that support adaptation at multiple levels of biological\norganization. Though a discussion of simulation studies, molecular-based\nexperimental systems, principles from population genetics, and field\nexperiments, we demonstrate that CGV and degeneracy reflect complementary\ntop-down and bottom-up, respectively, conceptualizations of the same basic\nphenomenon and arguably capture a universal feature of biological adaptive\nprocesses.\n",

Apart from phase jumps, a\nstochastic version of the Kuramoto equations can be approximated by a\ncointegrated system of difference equations. As one consequence, the rich\ntheory on statistical inference for cointegrated systems can immediately be\napplied for statistical inference on phase synchronization based on empirical\ndata. This includes tests for phase synchronization, tests for unidirectional\ncoupling and the identification of the equilibrium from data including phase\nshifts. We study two examples on a unidirectionally coupled R\\\"ossler-Lorenz\nsystem and on electrochemical oscillators.

The internal\nneuronal dynamics of the patch is not described by the model, rather it is\nsubsumed into an effective description in terms of graded Potts units, with\nadaptation effects both specific to each attractor state and generic to the\npatch. If each unit, or patch, receives effective (tensor) connections from C\nother units, the network has been shown to be able to store a large number p of\nglobal patterns, or network attractors, each with a fraction a of the units\nactive, where the critical load p_c scales roughly like p_c ~ (C S^2)/(a\nln(1/a)) (if the patterns are randomly correlated). Interestingly, after\nretrieving an externally cued attractor, the network can continue jumping, or\nlatching, from attractor to attractor, driven by adaptation effects. The\noccurrence and duration of latching dynamics is found through simulations to\ndepend critically on the strength of local attractor states, expressed in the\nPotts model by a parameter w. Here we describe with simulations and then\nanalytically the boundaries between distinct phases of no latching, of\ntransient and sustained latching, deriving a phase diagram in the plane w-T,\nwhere T parametrizes thermal noise effects.

In this limit, we describe\nbifurcations between incoherence, local synchrony, and global synchrony. We\ncompare the predictions of this simplified model with simulations of\nheterogeneous networks in which the internal structure of each community is\npreserved and find excellent agreement.

In order to assess OSA\nscenarios of CRs, two oligopoly game models are reformulated in terms of\nresource access: Cournot and Stackelberg games. Five CR scenes are analysed:\nsimultaneous access of unlicensed users (commons regime) with symmetric and\nasymmetric costs, with and without bandwidth constraints and sequential access\n(licensed against unlicensed). Several equilibrium concepts are studied as game\nsolutions: Nash, Pareto and the joint NashPareto equilibrium. The latter\ncaptures a game situation where players are non-homogeneous users, exhibiting\ndifferent types of rationality, Nash and Pareto. This enables a more realistic\nmodelling of interactions on a CR scene. An evolutionary game equilibrium\ndetection method is used. The Nash equilibrium indicates the maximum number of\nchannels a CR may access without decreasing its payoff. The Pareto equilibrium\ndescribes a larger range of payoffs, capturing unbalanced as well as equitable\nsolutions. The analysis of the Stackelberg modelling shows that payoffs are\nmaximised for all users if the incumbents are Nash oriented and the new\nentrants are Pareto driven.\n",

These findings mean\nthat the larger the city, the more disproportionally they are places of wealth\nand innovation. Local properties of cities cause a deviation from the expected\nbehavior as predicted by the power law scaling.

Moreover, the power law exponents for\nuniversity scaling are comparable to those for urban scaling.

RC is a computational paradigm in which a trained readout layer\ninterprets the dynamics of an excitable component (called the reservoir) that\nis perturbed by external input. The reservoir is often implemented as a\nhomogeneous recurrent neural network, but there has been little investigation\ninto the properties of reservoirs that are discrete and heterogeneous. Random\nBoolean networks are generic and heterogeneous dynamical systems and here we\nuse them as the reservoir. An RBN is typically a closed system; to use it as a\nreservoir we extend it with an input layer. As a consequence of perturbation,\nthe RBN does not necessarily fall into an attractor. Computational capability\nin RC arises from a trade-off between separability and fading memory of inputs.\nWe find the balance of these properties predictive of classification power and\noptimal at critical connectivity. These results are relevant to the\nconstruction of devices which exploit the intrinsic dynamics of complex\nheterogeneous systems, such as biomolecular substrates.\n",

We show that higher Fourier modes can cause desychronization due to\nclustering effects, and that this can reinforce clustering caused by different\nforms of coupling.

The asymptotic\nmagnitude of a disturbance is shown to fall off as erf(ct./sq. rt. n) when n\ngoes to infinity.

Although it was long thought that\nsynchrony or disorder were mutually exclusive steady states for a network of\nidentical oscillators, numerous theoretical studies in recent years have\nrevealed the intriguing possibility of `chimera states', in which the symmetry\nof the oscillator population is broken into a synchronous and an asynchronous\npart. However, a striking lack of empirical evidence raises the question of\nwhether chimeras are indeed characteristic to natural systems. This calls for a\npalpable realization of chimera states without any fine-tuning, from which\nphysical mechanisms underlying their emergence can be uncovered. Here, we\ndevise a simple experiment with mechanical oscillators coupled in a\nhierarchical network to show that chimeras emerge naturally from a competition\nbetween two antagonistic synchronization patterns. We identify a wide spectrum\nof complex states, encompassing and extending the set of previously described\nchimeras. Our mathematical model shows that the self-organization observed in\nour experiments is controlled by elementary dynamical equations from mechanics\nthat are ubiquitous in many natural and technological systems.

As\nthese networks are of great interest as dynamical models of biological and\ncognitive processes, it is useful to understand how particular graphs can be\nrealised as robust heteroclinic networks that are attracting. This paper\npresents two methods of realizing arbitrarily complex directed graphs as robust\nheteroclinic networks for flows generated by ODEs---we say the ODEs {\\em\nrealise} the graphs as heteroclinic networks between equilibria that represent\nthe vertices. Suppose we have a directed graph on $n_v$ vertices with $n_e$\nedges. The \"simplex realisation\" embeds the graph as an invariant set of a flow\non an $(n_v-1)$-simplex. This method realises the graph as long as it is one-\nand two-cycle free. The \"cylinder realisation\" embeds a graph as an invariant\nset of a flow on a $(n_e+1)$-dimensional space. This method realises the graph\nas long as it is one-cycle free. In both cases we find the graph as an\ninvariant set within an attractor, and discuss some illustrative examples,\nincluding the influence of noise and parameters on the dynamics.

Specifically, for dynamical networks on convergent\nsequences of simple and weighted graphs, we prove convergence of solutions of\nthe initial-value problems for discrete models to those of the limiting\ncontinuous equations. In addition, for sequences of simple graphs converging to\n{0, 1}-valued graphons, it is shown that the convergence rate depends on the\nfractal dimension of the boundary of the support of the graph limit. These\nresults are then used to study the regions of continuity of chimera states and\nthe attractors of the nonlocal Kuramoto equation on certain multipartite\ngraphs. Furthermore, the analytical tools developed in this work are used in\nthe rigorous justification of the continuum limit for networks on random graphs\nthat we undertake in a companion paper (Medvedev, 2013).\n  As a by-product of the analysis of the continuum limit on deterministic and\nrandom graphs, we identify the link between this problem and the convergence\nanalysis of several classical numerical schemes: the collocation, Galerkin, and\nMonte-Carlo methods. Therefore, our results can be used to characterize\nconvergence of these approximate methods of solving initial-value problems for\nnonlinear evolution equations with nonlocal interactions.\n",

When this\nextremely cold brine leaves the ice it freezes the water it comes into contact\nwith; a hollow tube of ice --- a brinicle --- growing downwards around the\nplume of descending brine. We show that brinicles can be understood as a form\nof the self-assembled tubular precipitation structures termed chemical gardens,\nplant-like structures formed on placing together a soluble metal salt, often in\nthe form of a seed crystal, and an aqueous solution of one of many anions,\noften silicate. On one hand, in the case of classical chemical gardens, an\nosmotic pressure difference across a semipermeable precipitation membrane that\nfilters solutions by rejecting the solute leads to an inflow of water and to\nits rupture. The internal solution, generally being lighter than the external\nsolution, flows up through the break, and as it does so a tube grows upwards by\nprecipitation around the jet of internal solution. Such chemical-garden tubes\ncan grow to many centimetres in length. In the case of brinicles, on the other\nhand, in floating sea ice we have porous ice in a mushy layer that filters out\nwater, by freezing it, and allows concentrated brine through. Again there is an\nosmotic pressure difference leading to a continuing ingress of sea water in a\nsiphon pump mechanism that is sustained as long as the ice continues to freeze.\nSince the brine that is pumped out is denser than the sea water, and descends\nrather rises, a brinicle is a downwards growing tube of ice; an inverse\nchemical garden.\n",

However, the\nmotivation for this model is entirely ad hoc. We use exact likelihood arguments\nand show that the optimal way to build a scale-free network is to attach most\nnew links to nodes of low degree. Curiously, this leads to a scale-free\nnetworks with a single dominant hub: a star-like structure we call a super-star\nnetwork. Asymptotically, the optimal strategy is to attach each new node to one\nof the nodes of degree $k$ with probability proportional to\n$\\frac{1}{N+\\zeta(\\gamma)(k+1)^\\gamma}$ (in a $N$ node network) --- a stronger\nbias toward high degree nodes than exhibited by standard preferential\nattachment.

We show that this class of solutions plays an\nimportant role in the formation of spatial patterns in the Kuramoto model on SW\ngraphs.

The former approach shows that long-range random\nconnections in the SW graphs promote synchronization and yields the estimate of\nthe synchronization rate as a function of the SW randomization parameter. The\ncontinuation shows that the increase of the long-range connections results in\npatterns consisting of one or several plateaus separated by sharp interfaces.\n  These results elucidate the pattern formation mechanisms in nonlocally\ncoupled dynamical systems on random graphs.\n",

To properly model\nthe dynamics, the theory must be fully compatible with findings by social\npsychologists on microscopic opinion change. Here we introduce a generic model\nof opinion formation with homogeneous agents based on the well-known social\njudgment theory in social psychology by extending a similar model proposed by\nJager and Amblard. The agents' opinions will eventually cluster around extreme\nand/or moderate opinions forming three phases in a two-dimensional parameter\nspace that describes the microscopic opinion response of the agents. The\ndynamics of this model can be qualitatively understood by mean-field analysis.\nMore importantly, first-order phase transition in opinion distribution is\nobserved by evolving the system under a slow change in the system parameters,\nshowing that punctuated equilibria in public opinion can occur even in a fully\nconnected social network.\n",

In our model\nthe susceptibility of the system to cascades is described by a single number,\nthe propagation power, which measures the ease with which cascades propagate.\nPhysically, such a number could represent the density of unstable material in a\nsystem, its internal connectivity, or the mean susceptibility of its component\nparts to failure. We assume that the propagation power follows an upward\ndrifting Brownian motion between cascades, and drops discontinuously each time\na cascade occurs. Cascades are described by a continuous state branching\nprocess with distributional properties determined by the value of the\npropagation power when they occur. In common with many cascading models, pure\npower law behaviour is exhibited at a critical level of propagation power, and\nthe mean cascade size diverges. This divergence constrains large systems to the\nsubcritical region. We show that as a result, crossover behaviour appears in\nthe cascade distribution when an average is performed over the distribution of\npropagation power. We are able to analytically determine the exponents before\nand after the crossover.\n",

This\nproblem is common in phenomena displaying power-law-like distributions. Power\nlaws play a central role in complex systems theory; therefore, the current\nlimitations in the identification of this distribution in empirical data are a\nmajor obstacle to pursue the insights that the complexity approach offers in\nmany fields. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a reliable\nmethodology with a solid theoretical foundation, the Taylor Series-Based Power\nLaw Range Identification Method. When applied to time series from 39 countries,\nthis method reveals a well-defined power law in the relative per capita GDP\ncontractions that span from 5.53% to 50%, comprising 263 events. However, this\nobservation does not suffice to attribute recessions to some specific\nmechanism, such as self-organized criticality.

Previously, researchers surmised that a single general concept may act\nas a unifying underlying generative mechanism, with the theory of self\norganized criticality being a weighty contender.\n  Consequently, a substantial amount of effort has gone into developing new and\nextended models and, hitherto, three classes of models have emerged. The first\nline of models is based on a separation between the time scales of drive and\ndissipation, and includes the original sandpile model and its extensions, like\nthe dissipative earthquake model. Within this approach the steady state is\nclose to criticality in terms of an absorbing phase transition. The second line\nof models is based on external drives and internal dynamics competing on\nsimilar time scales and includes the coherent noise model, which has a\nnon-critical steady state characterized by heavy-tailed distributions. The\nthird line of models proposes a non-critical self-organizing state, being\nguided by an optimization principle, such as the concept of highly optimized\ntolerance.\n  We present a comparative overview regarding distinct modeling approaches\ntogether with a discussion of their potential relevance as underlying\ngenerative models for real-world phenomena. The complexity of physical and\nbiological scaling phenomena has been found to transcend the explanatory power\nof individual paradigmal concepts. The interaction between theoretical\ndevelopment and experimental observations has been very fruitful, leading to a\nseries of novel concepts and insights.\n",

Recent\nprogress builds on a mathematical framework in which a real-world system is\ndescribed by a low-dimensional equation system with a small number of key\nvariables, where the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation.\nHere we show that in high-dimensional systems, containing many variables, we\nfrequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative saddle-type mechanism\nleading to critical transitions. This generic class of transitions has been\nmissed in the search for early-warnings up to now. In fact, the saddle-type\nmechanism also applies to low-dimensional systems with saddle-dynamics. Near a\nsaddle a system moves slowly and the state may be perceived as stable over\nsubstantial time periods. We develop an early warning sign for the saddle-type\ntransition. We illustrate our results in two network models and epidemiological\ndata.

The principle purpose of this project is to use models of neural\ndynamics and learning based on the underlying principle of self-organised\ncriticality, to account for the age related cognitive effects. In this regard\nlearning in neural networks can serve as a model for the acquisition of skills\nand knowledge in early development stages i.e. the ageing process and\ncriticality in the network serves as the optimum state of cognitive abilities.\nPossible candidate mechanisms for ageing in a neural network are loss of\nconnectivity and neurons, increase in the level of noise, reduction in white\nmatter or more interestingly longer learning history and the competition among\nseveral optimization objectives. In this paper we are primarily interested in\nthe affect of the longer learning history on memory and thus the optimality in\nthe brain.

The fixed nodes play the role of opinion makers in\nthe voter model, mutation rates in population genetics or temperature in a\nmagnetic material. The quantity of interest is the probability $\\rho(m,t)$ that\n$m$ nodes are in state 1 at time $t$. Here we study this process on star\nnetworks and compare the results with those obtained for networks that are\nfully connected. In both cases a transition from disordered to ordered\nequilibrium states is observed as the number of external fixed nodes becomes\nsmall, but it differs significantly between the two network topologies. For\nfully connected networks the probability distribution becomes uniform at the\ncritical point, which is independent of the network size. For star networks, on\nthe other hand, the equilibrium distribution $\\rho(m)$ splits in two peaks,\nreflecting the two possible states of the central node. We obtain approximate\nanalytical solutions that hold near the transition and that clarify the role of\nthe central node in the process. We show that the different character of the\ntransition also manifest itself in the magnetization of system, obtained in the\nlimit of large $N$. Finally, extending the analysis to two star networks we\ncompare our results with simulations in scalefree networks, detecting the\npresence of hubs.\n",

In this paper we show that a thermodynamic model based on the Maximum\nEntropy Principle, with dynamical prior information, can be constructed that\nadequately describes the dynamics and distribution of firms' growth. Our\ntheoretical framework is tested against a comprehensive data-base of Spanish\nfirms, which covers to a very large extent Spain's economic activity with a\ntotal of 1,155,142 firms evolving along a full decade. We show that the\nempirical exponent of Pareto's law, a rule often observed in the rank\ndistribution of large-size firms, is explained by the capacity of the economic\nsystem for creating/destroying firms, and can be used to measure the health of\na capitalist-based economy. Indeed, our model predicts that when the exponent\nis larger that 1, creation of firms is favored; when it is smaller that 1,\ndestruction of firms is favored instead; and when it equals 1 (matching Zipf's\nlaw), the system is in a full macroeconomic equilibrium, entailing \"free\"\ncreation and/or destruction of firms. For medium and smaller firm-sizes, the\ndynamical regime changes; the whole distribution can no longer be fitted to a\nsingle simple analytic form and numerical prediction is required. Our model\nconstitutes the basis of a full predictive framework for the economic evolution\nof an ensemble of firms that can be potentially used to develop simulations and\ntest hypothetical scenarios, as economic crisis or the response to specific\npolicy measures.\n",

Whenever two\nentities cooperate, one must willingly relinquish something of value to the\nother. Why is this apparent altruism favored in evolution? Classical solutions\nassume a net fitness gain in a cooperative transaction which, through\nreciprocity or relatedness, finds its way back from recipient to donor. We seek\nthe source of this fitness gain. Our analysis rests on the insight that\nevolutionary processes are typically multiplicative and noisy. Fluctuations\nhave a net negative effect on the long-time growth rate of resources but no\neffect on the growth rate of their expectation value. This is an example of\nnon-ergodicity. By reducing the amplitude of fluctuations, pooling and sharing\nincreases the long-time growth rate for cooperating entities, meaning that\ncooperators outgrow similar non-cooperators. We identify this increase in\ngrowth rate as the net fitness gain, consistent with the concept of geometric\nmean fitness in the biological literature. This constitutes a fundamental\nmechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Its minimal assumptions make it a\ncandidate explanation of cooperation in settings too simple for other fitness\ngains, such as emergent function and specialization, to be probable.

During such\nraids ants lay pheromones to form trails for others to find a food source. In\nthis work a coupled PDE/ODE model is introduced to study ant dynamics and\npheromone concentration. The key idea is the introduction of two forms of ant\ndynamics: foraging and returning, each governed by different environmental and\nsocial cues. The model accounts for all aspects of the raiding cycle including\nlocal collisional interactions, the laying of pheromone along a trail, and the\ntransition from one class of ants to another. Through analysis of an order\nparameter measuring the orientational order in the system, the model shows\nself-organization into a collective state consisting of lanes of ants moving in\nopposite directions as well as the transition back to the individual state once\nthe food source is depleted matching prior experimental results. This indicates\nthat in the absence of direct communication ants naturally form an efficient\nmethod for transporting food to the nest/bivouac. The model exhibits a\ncontinuous kinetic phase transition in the order parameter as a function of\ncertain system parameters.

Finally, for the more\ngeneral initial condition the symmetric dynamics could be reduced to a rigorous\nthree-dimensional manifold which shows that the neutrally stable chaos could\nalso occur in this model for particular parameter.

Linear\nand nonlinear stages of the (inertialess) surfactant and gravity dependent\nlong-wave instability are studied using the lubrication approximation, which\nleads to a system of coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the interface\nand surfactant disturbances. The linear stability is determined by an\neigenvalue problem for the normal modes. The growth rates and the amplitudes of\ndisturbances of the interface, surfactant, velocities, and pressures are found\nanalytically. For each wavenumber, there are two active normal modes. For each\nmode, the instability threshold conditions in terms of the system parameters\nare determined. In particular, it transpires that for certain parametric\nranges, even arbitrarily strong gravity cannot completely stabilize the flow.\nThe correlations of vorticity-thickness phase differences with instability,\npresent when the gravitational effects are neglected, are found to break down\nwhen gravity is important. The physical mechanisms of instability for the two\nmodes are explained with vorticity playing no role in them. Unlike the\nsemi-infinite case that we previously studied, a small-amplitude nonlinear\nsaturation of the surfactant instability is possible in the absence of gravity.\nFor certain parametric ranges, the interface deflection is governed by a\ndecoupled Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, which provides a source term for a\nlinear convection-diffusion equation governing the surfactant concentration.\nThe full numerics confirm the prediction that, along with the interface, the\nsurfactant wave is chaotic, but the ratio of the two chaotic waves is constant.\n",

These findings establish a unified characterization\nof networks optimized for dynamical stability, which we illustrate using Turing\ninstability in activator-inhibitor systems, synchronization in power-grid\nnetworks, network diffusion, and several other network processes. Our results\nsuggest that the network structure of a complex system operating near an\noptimum can potentially be fine-tuned for a significantly enhanced stability\ncompared to what one might expect from simple extrapolation.

When connected in a complex circuit these exhibit\nvery exotic behavior, typical of disordered systems, such as a universal slow\nrelaxation for intricated circuit topologies, and strong dependence on the\ninitial conditions. Being memristive components part of a circuit, non-local\neffects due to the Kirchhoff constraints are present. In the formalism\ndeveloped recently for a fairly general class of memristive circuits the\nconstraints are contained in a projection operator. We provide exact results\nregarding the fall-off of the elements with the Hamming distance on the\ncircuit, thus elucidating an insofar elusive and open question regarding the\nnon-local effects in crossbar arrays, currently being considered for on-chip\nmachine learning.\n",

Characterizing the structure of these\nbasins is, in general, a complicated task, especially in high dimensionality.\nRecent works have advocated to quantify the non-linear stability of fixed\npoints of dynamical systems through the relative volumes of the associated\nbasins of attraction [D. A. Wiley {\\it et al.} Chaos {\\bf 16}, 015103 (2006),\nP. J. Menck {\\it et al.} Nat. Phys. {\\bf 9}, 89 (2013)]. Here we revisit this\nissue and propose an efficient numerical method to estimate these volumes. The\nalgorithm first identifies stable fixed points. Second, a set of initial\nconditions is considered that are randomly distributed at the surface of\nhypercubes centered on each fixed point. These initial conditions are\ndynamically evolved. The linear size of each basin of attraction is finally\ndetermined by the proportion of initial conditions which converge back to the\nfixed point. Armed with this algorithm, we revisit the problem considered by\nWiley et al. in a seminal paper [D. A. Wiley {\\it et al.} Chaos {\\bf 16},\n015103 (2006)] that inspired the title of the present manuscript, and consider\nthe equal-frequency Kuramoto model on a cycle. Fixed points of this model are\ncharacterized by an integer winding number $q$ and the number $n$ of\noscillators. We find that the basin volumes scale as $(1-4q/n)^n$, contrasting\nwith the Gaussian behavior postulated in Wiley et al.'s paper.

In two contrasting limits of the dynamics, we obtain exact\nanalytical results for the phase transitions. These two limits correspond to\n(i) the absence of thermal noise, when the dynamics reduces to that of a\nnon-linear dynamical system, and (ii) the oscillators having the same natural\nfrequency, when the dynamics becomes that of a statistical system in contact\nwith a heat bath and relaxing to a statistical equilibrium state. In the former\ncase, our exact analysis is based on the use of the so-called Ott-Antonsen\nansatz to derive a reduced set of nonlinear partial differential equations for\nthe macroscopic evolution of the system. Our results for the case of\nstatistical equilibrium are on the other hand obtained by extending the\nwell-known transfer matrix approach for nearest-neighbor Ising model to\nconsider non-local interactions. The work offers a case study of exact analysis\nin many-body interacting systems.

This result has\nbeen used to explain the existence of the $N-3$ constants of motion discovered\nby Watanabe and Strogatz for Kuramoto oscillator networks. In this work we\ninvestigate geometric consequences of this M\\\"obius group action. The dynamics\nof Kuramoto phase models can be further reduced to 2D reduced group orbits,\nwhich have a natural geometry equivalent to the unit disk $\\Delta$ with the\nhyperbolic metric. We show that in this metric the original Kuramoto phase\nmodel (with order parameter $Z_1$ equal to the centroid of the oscillator\nconfiguration of points on the unit circle) is a gradient flow and the model\nwith order parameter $iZ_1$ (corresponding to cosine phase coupling) is a\ncompletely integrable Hamiltonian flow. We give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for general Kuramoto phase models to be gradient or Hamiltonian\nflows in this metric. This allows us to identify several new infinite families\nof hyperbolic gradient or Hamiltonian Kuramoto oscillator networks which\ntherefore have simple dynamics with respect to this geometry. We prove that for\nthe $Z_1$ model, a generic 2D reduced group orbit has a unique fixed point\ncorresponding to the hyperbolic barycenter of the oscillator configuration, and\ntherefore the dynamics are equivalent on different generic reduced group\norbits.

Nature features transport networks that are adaptive\nover a vast range of parameters, thus providing an impressive level of\nrobustness in supply. Theoretical and experimental studies have found that\nreal-world transport networks exhibit both tree-like motifs and cycles. When\nthe network is subject to load fluctuations, the presence of cyclic motifs may\nhelp to reduce flow fluctuations and, thus, render supply in the network more\nrobust. While previous studies considered network topology via optimization\nprinciples, here, we take a dynamical systems approach and study a simple model\nof a flow network with dynamically adapting weights (conductances). We assume a\nspatially non-uniform distribution of rapidly fluctuating loads in the sinks\nand investigate what network configurations are dynamically stable. The network\nconverges to a spatially non-uniform stable configuration composed of both\ncyclic and tree-like structures. Cyclic structures emerge locally in a\ntranscritical bifurcation as the amplitude of the load fluctuations is\nincreased. The resulting adaptive dynamics thus partitions the network into two\ndistinct regions with cyclic and tree-like structures. The location of the\nboundary between these two regions is determined by the amplitude of the\nfluctuations.

The\nKuramoto model provides the basic analytical framework to study spontaneous\nsynchronization. The model comprises limit-cycle oscillators with distributed\nnatural frequencies interacting through a mean-field coupling. Although more\nthan forty years have passed since its introduction, the model continues to\noccupy the centre-stage of research in the field of non-linear dynamics, and is\nalso widely applied to model diverse physical situations. In this brief review,\nstarting with a derivation of the Kuramoto model and the synchronization\nphenomenon it exhibits, we summarize recent results on the study of a\ngeneralized Kuramoto model that includes inertial effects and stochastic noise.\nWe describe the dynamics of the generalized model from a different yet a rather\nuseful perspective, namely, that of long-range interacting systems driven out\nof equilibrium by quenched disordered external torques. A system is said to be\nlong-range interacting if the inter-particle potential decays slowly as a\nfunction of distance. Using tools of statistical physics, we highlight the\nequilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of the dynamics of the generalized\nKuramoto model, and uncover a rather rich and complex phase diagram that it\nexhibits, which underlines the basic theme of intriguing emergent phenomena\nthat are exhibited by many-body complex systems.\n",

Fixpoints, limit cycles, and chaotic attractors\ncorrespond in this setting to a non-moving robot, to directed, and to irregular\nlocomotion respectively. Short higher-order control commands may hence be used\nto kick the system from one self-organized attractor robustly into the basin of\nattraction of a different attractor, a concept termed here as kick control. The\nindividual sensorimotor states serve in this context as highly compliant motor\nprimitives.\n  We study different implementations of kick control for the case of simulated\nand real-world wheeled robots, for which the dynamics of the distinct wheels is\ngenerated independently by local feedback loops. The feedback loops are\nmediated by rate-encoding neurons disposing exclusively of propriosensoric\ninputs in terms of projections of the actual rotational angle of the wheel. The\nchanges of the neural activity are then transmitted into a rotational motion by\na simulated transmission rod akin to the transmission rods used for steam\nlocomotives.\n  We find that the self-organized attractor landscape may be morphed both by\nhigher-level control signals, in the spirit of kick control, and by interacting\nwith the environment. Bumping against a wall destroys the limit cycle\ncorresponding to forward motion, with the consequence that the dynamical\nvariables are then attracted in phase space by the limit cycle corresponding to\nbackward moving.

It was previously shown that, for even $D$,\nsimilar to the original Kuramoto model ($D=2$), there exists a continuous\ndynamical phase transition from incoherence to coherence of the time asymptotic\nattracting state as the coupling parameter $K$ increases through a critical\nvalue $K_c^{(+)}>0$. We consider this transition from the point of view of the\nstability of an incoherent state, i.e., where the $N\\to\\infty$ distribution\nfunction is time-independent and the macroscopic order parameter is zero. In\ncontrast with $D=2$, for even $D>2$ there is an infinity of possible incoherent\nequilibria, each of which becomes unstable with increasing $K$ at a different\npoint $K=K_c$. We show that there are incoherent equilibria for all $K_c$\nwithin the range $(K_c^{(+)}/2)\\leq K_c \\leq K_c^{(+)}$. How can the possible\ninstability of incoherent states arising at $K=K_c<K_c^{(+)}$ be reconciled\nwith the previous finding that, at large time, the state is always incoherent\nunless $K>K_c^{(+)}$? We find, for a given incoherent equilibrium, that, if $K$\nis rapidly increased from $K<K_c$ to $K_c<K<K_c^{(+)}$, due to the instability,\na short, macroscopic burst of coherence is observed, which initially grows\nexponentially, but then reaches a maximum, past which it decays back into\nincoherence. After this decay, we observe that the equilibrium has been reset\nto one whose $K_c$ value exceeds that of the increased $K$. Thus this process,\nwhich we call `Instability-Mediated Resetting,' leads to an increase in the\neffective $K_c$ with continuously increasing $K$, until the equilibrium has\nbeen effectively set to one for which for which $K_c\\approx K_c^{(+)}$, leading\nto a unique critical point of the time asymptotic state.\n",

Importantly, their functionality depends on the emerging\ncollective dynamics of the network. Synchrony of oscillations is one of the\nmost prominent examples of such collective behavior and has been associated\nboth with function and dysfunction. Understanding how network structure and\ninteractions, as well as the microscopic properties of individual units, shape\nthe emerging collective dynamics is critical to find factors that lead to\nmalfunction. However, many biological systems such as the brain consist of a\nlarge number of dynamical units. Hence, their analysis has either relied on\nsimplified heuristic models on a coarse scale, or the analysis comes at a huge\ncomputational cost. Here we review recently introduced approaches, known as the\nOtt-Antonsen and Watanabe-Strogatz reductions, allowing one to simplify the\nanalysis by bridging small and large scales. Thus, reduced model equations are\nobtained that exactly describe the collective dynamics for each subpopulation\nin the oscillator network via few collective variables only. The resulting\nequations are next-generation models: Rather than being heuristic, they exactly\nlink microscopic and macroscopic descriptions and therefore accurately capture\nmicroscopic properties of the underlying system. At the same time, they are\nsufficiently simple to analyze without great computational effort. In the last\ndecade, these reduction methods have become instrumental in understanding how\nnetwork structure and interactions shape the collective dynamics and the\nemergence of synchrony. We review this progress based on concrete examples and\noutline possible limitations. Finally, we discuss how linking the reduced\nmodels with experimental data can guide the way towards the development of new\ntreatment approaches, for example, for neurological disease.\n",

We show that\nthis phenomenon is fundamentally stochastic and collective in nature. Indeed,\nfor noise and coupling within specific ranges, an asymmetry in the transition\nrates between a resting and an excited regime progressively builds up, leading\nto an increase in the fraction of excited neurons eventually triggering a chain\nreaction associated with a macroscopic synchronized excursion and a collective\nreturn to rest where this process starts afresh, thus yielding the observed\nperiodic synchronized oscillations. We further uncover a novel anti-resonance\nphenomenon: noise-induced synchronized oscillations disappear when the system\nis driven by periodic stimulation with frequency within a specific range. In\nthat anti-resonance regime, the system is optimal for measures of information\ncapacity. This observation provides a new hypothesis accounting for the\nefficiency of Deep Brain Stimulation therapies in Parkinson's disease, a\nneurodegenerative disease characterized by an increased synchronization of\nbrain motor circuits. We further discuss the universality of these phenomena in\nthe class of stochastic networks of excitable elements with confining coupling,\nand illustrate this universality by analyzing various classical models of\nneuronal networks.

Classically, one would define for each\ntask a corresponding satisfaction level, with the agent engaging, at a given\ntime, in the activity having the lowest satisfaction level. Alternatively, one\nmay consider that the agent follows the overarching objective to generate\nsequences of distinct activities. To achieve a balanced distribution of\nactivities would then be the primary goal, and not to master a specific task.\nIn this setting, the agent would show two types of behaviors, task-oriented,\nand task-searching phases, with the latter interseeding the former.\n  We study the emergence of autonomous task switching for the case of a\nsimulated robot arm. Grasping one of several moving objects corresponds in this\nsetting to a specific activity. Overall, the arm should follow a given object\ntemporarily and then move away, in order to search for a new target and\nreengage. We show that this behavior can be generated robustly when modeling\nthe arm as an adaptive dynamical system. The dissipation function is in this\napproach time dependent. The arm is in a dissipative state when searching for a\nnearby object, dissipating energy on approach. Once close, the dissipation\nfunction starts to increase, with the eventual sign change implying that the\narm will take up energy and wander off. The resulting explorative state ends\nwhen the dissipation function becomes again negative and the arm selects a new\ntarget. We believe that our approach may be generalized to generate\nself-organized sequences of activities in general.\n",

The\nmain challenge in proving these claims is that self organization cannot be\ndetected through direct observation, but through measurements on the system,\nlooking for hints such as the existence of power laws over some features, such\nas the size of changes over time. The problem we intend to tackle in this paper\nis to establish a methodology for checking, for a chosen set of repositories we\nhad already measured in the past, if the claims about power laws actually hold\nfrom a precise mathematical point of view, since, although shown as pervasive\nin the software engineering literature (and others), power laws are more\nelusive than they might seem at first sight. For that reason, in this paper we\npresent a statistically accurate set of tests that will help us decide, from\nthe way repositories are changing, if they are really distributed by a power\nlaw, which could indicate us the existence of a state reached via\nself-organization, or actually, how accurately a power law fits the observed\ndistribution of the size of changes of commits in git repositories of 16 open\nsource repositories. We revisit one of the most representative papers of these\nobservations to reevaluate its results and compare them with the current status\nof the repositories analyzed in it, trying to elucidate if there has been any\nchange in the possible presence, or not, of a power law.\n",

To quantify the required\nstrength of regional connections, we first obtain a critical value for the\nalgebraic connectivity of the corresponding subnetwork using the incremental 2\nnorm. We then introduce the concept of the generalized complement graph, and\nobtain another condition on the weighted nodal degree by using the incremental\ninfinity norm. Under these two conditions, regions of attraction for partial\nphase cohesiveness are estimated in the forms of the incremental 2 and infinity\nnorms, respectively.

The family of metrics is proposed to create a neural network\ninformation converter based on a network of pulsed oscillators. In addition to\ntransforming input information from digital to analogue, the converter can\nperform information processing after training the network by selecting control\nparameters. In the proposed neural network scheme, the data arrives at the\ninput layer in the form of current levels of the oscillators and is converted\ninto a set of non-repeating states of the chimeric synchronization of the\noutput oscillator. By modelling a thermally coupled VO2-oscillator circuit, the\nnetwork setup is demonstrated through the selection of coupling strength, power\nsupply levels, and the synchronization efficiency parameter. The distribution\nof solutions depending on the operating mode of the oscillators, sub-threshold\nmode, or generation mode are revealed. Technological approaches for the\nimplementation of a neural network information converter are proposed, and\nexamples of its application for image filtering are demonstrated.

Yet both biological and manmade systems\nprovide striking examples of spontaneous desynchronization, such as failure\ncascades in alternating current power grids or neuronal avalanches in the\nmammalian brain. Here, we generalize classical models of synchronization among\nheterogenous oscillators to include short-range phase repulsion among\nindividuals, a property that abets the emergence of a stable desynchronized\nstate. Surprisingly, we find that our model exhibits self-organized avalanches\nat intermediate values of the repulsion strength, and that these avalanches\nhave similar statistical properties to cascades seen in real-world systems such\nas neuronal avalanches. We find that these avalanches arise due to a critical\nmechanism based on competition between mean field recruitment and local\ndisplacement, a property that we replicate in a classical cellular automaton\nmodel of traffic jams. We exactly solve our system in the many-oscillator\nlimit, and obtain analytical results relating the onset of avalanches or\npartial synchrony to the relative heterogeneity of the oscillators, and their\ndegree of mutual repulsion.

To explain this, it has\nbeen observed that as a network grows certain subsets of the network begin to\nspecialize the function(s) they perform. A recent model of network growth based\non this notion of specialization has been able to reproduce some of the most\nwell-known topological features found in real-world networks including\nright-skewed degree distributions, the small world property, modular as well as\nhierarchical topology, etc. Here we describe how specialization under this\nmodel also effects the spectral properties of a network.

Specifically, we show that if a network is intrinsically\nstable, which is a stronger version of the standard notion of global stability,\nthen the network maintains this type of dynamics as the network evolves. This\nis one of the first steps toward unifying the rigorous study of the two types\nof dynamics exhibited by networks. These are the \\emph{dynamics of} a network,\nwhich is the study of the topological evolution of the network's structure,\nmodeled here by the process of network specialization, and the \\emph{dynamics\non} a network, which is the changing state of the network elements, where the\ntype of dynamics we consider is global stability.

To gain\ninsight into this question, we numerically study driven disordered mechanical\nnetworks of bistable springs which possess a vast number of stable\nconfigurations arising from the two stable rest lengths of each spring, thereby\ncapturing the essential physical properties of a broad class of multistable\nsystems. We find that the attractor states of driven disordered multistable\nmechanical networks are fine-tuned with respect to the pattern of external\nforcing to have low work absorption from it. Furthermore, we find that these\ndrive-specific attractor states are even more stable than expected for a given\nlevel of work absorption. Our results suggest that the driven exploration of\nthe vast configuration space of these systems is biased towards states with\nexceptional relationship to the driving environment, and could therefore be\nused to `discover' states with desired response properties in systems with a\nvast landscape of diverse configurations.\n",

The classical voter model is a\nwell-established conceptual model to study such processes. In this work, we\ndefine a new form of adaptive (or co-evolutionary) voter model posed on a\nsimplicial complex, i.e., on a certain class of hypernetworks/hypergraphs. We\nuse the persuasion rule along edges of the classical voter model and the\nrecently studied re-wiring rule of edges towards like-minded nodes, and\nintroduce a new peer pressure rule applied to three nodes connected via a\n2-simplex. This simplicial adaptive voter model is studied via numerical\nsimulation. We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive\nvoter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon\nvarying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented\nstate of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the\nfragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial\nquantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state\nbelow the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards\nfragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a\nmultiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices,\nbefore the depletion of active edges. This leads to the conjecture that many\nother dynamic network models on simplicial complexes may show a similar\nbehaviour with respect to the sequential evolution of simplicies of different\ndimensions.\n",

To investigate the nature of multiscale coordination in\nliving systems, one needs a meaningful and systematic way to quantify the\ncomplex dynamics, a challenge in both theoretical and empirical realms. The\npresent work shows how integrating approaches from computational algebraic\ntopology and dynamical systems may help us meet this challenge. In particular,\nwe focus on the application of multiscale topological analysis to coordinated\nrhythmic processes. First, theoretical arguments are introduced as to why\ncertain topological features and their scale-dependency are highly relevant to\nunderstanding complex collective dynamics. Second, we propose a method to\ncapture such dynamically relevant topological information using persistent\nhomology, which allows us to effectively construct a multiscale topological\nportrait of rhythmic coordination. Finally, the method is put to test in\ndetecting transitions in real data from an experiment of rhythmic coordination\nin ensembles of interacting humans. The recurrence plots of topological\nportraits highlight collective transitions in coordination patterns that were\nelusive to more traditional methods. This sensitivity to collective transitions\nwould be lost if the behavioral dynamics of individuals were treated as\nseparate degrees of freedom instead of constituents of the topology that they\ncollectively forge. Such multiscale topological portraits highlight collective\naspects of coordination patterns that are irreducible to properties of\nindividual parts. The present work demonstrates how the analysis of multiscale\ncoordination dynamics can benefit from topological methods, thereby paving the\nway for further systematic quantification of complex, high-dimensional dynamics\nin living systems.\n",

Under favorable environmental\nconditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms\nreferred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating\nwave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A\ntantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the\npresence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band\nis mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this\neffect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and\nexperimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper\nbands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the\nfront. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the\nposition of individuals and a partial differential equation model that\ndescribes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary\n(and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which\nlocusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced\n(diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the\nformation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the\nbiological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our\nmodels. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band's\ncollective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By\nexamining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically\nconsistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate\nthat resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed\nin locust hopper bands.

Explosive sychronization has been observed in several natural\nsystems, and recent evidence suggests that it might also occur in the brain. A\nnatural system to study this phenomenon is the Kuramoto model that describes an\nensemble of coupled phase oscillators. Here we calculate bi-variate similarity\nmeasures (the cross-correlation, $\\rho_{ij}$, and the phase locking value,\nPLV$_{ij}$) between the phases, $\\phi_i(t)$ and $\\phi_j(t)$, of pairs of\noscillators and determine the lag time between them as the time-shift,\n$\\tau_{ij}$, which gives maximum similarity (i.e., the maximum of\n$\\rho_{ij}(\\tau)$ or PLV$_{ij}(\\tau)$). We find that, as the transition to\nsynchrony is approached, changes in the distribution of lag times provide an\nearlier warning of the synchronization transition (either gradual or\nexplosive). The analysis of experimental data, recorded from Rossler-like\nelectronic chaotic oscillators, suggests that these findings are not limited to\nphase oscillators, as the lag times display qualitatively similar behavior with\nincreasing coupling strength, as in the Kuramoto oscillators.

This control is computed via the minimization of a given\ncost functional associated with the dynamics considered. For this minimization,\nwe propose a novel approach based on the combination of a standard Gradient\nDescent (GD) methodology with the recently-developed Random Batch Method (RBM)\nfor the efficient numerical approximation of collective dynamics.

In continuum versions\nof this model an oscillator population is represented by a probability density\non the circle. Ott and Antonsen identified a special class of densities which\nis invariant under the dynamics and on which the dynamics are low-dimensional\nand analytically tractable. The reduction to the OA manifold has been used to\nanalyze the dynamics of many variants of the Kuramoto model. To address the\nfundamental question of whether the OA manifold is attracting, we develop a\nsystematic technique using weighted averages of Poisson measures for analyzing\ndynamics off the OA manifold. We show that for models with a finite number of\npopulations, the OA manifold is {\\it not} attracting in any sense; moreover,\nthe dynamics off the OA manifold is often more complex than on the OA manifold,\neven at the level of macroscopic order parameters. The OA manifold consists of\nPoisson densities $\\rho_\\omega$. A simple extension of the OA manifold consists\nof averages of pairs of Poisson densities; then the hyperbolic distance between\nthe centroids of each Poisson pair is a dynamical invariant (for each\n$\\omega$). These conserved quantities, defined on the double Poisson manifold,\nare a measure of the distance to the OA manifold. This invariance implies that\nchimera states, which have some but not all populations in sync, can never be\nstable in the full state space, even if stable in the OA manifold. More\nbroadly, our framework facilitates the analysis of multi-population continuum\nKuramoto networks beyond the restrictions of the OA manifold, and has the\npotential to reveal more intricate dynamical behavior than has previously been\nobserved for these networks.\n",

When short term depression in inhibitory synapses and firing threshold\nadaptation are added, the system hovers around the critical point.

This\nsystem has a rich dynamical repertoire of spiking patterns: synchronous regular\n(SR), asynchronous regular (AR), synchronous irregular (SI), slow oscillations\n(SO) and AI. It also presents dynamic balance of synaptic currents, since\ninhibitory currents try and compensate excitatory currents over time, resulting\nin both of them scaling linearly with external input. Our model thus unifies\ntwo different perspectives on cortical spontaneous activity: both critical\navalanches and fluctuation-driven AI firing arise from SOqC homeostatic\nadaptation, and are indeed two sides of the same coin.\n",

Our results suggest that, for weak couplings, MMOs appear due to the\nde-synchronization of a large number of quiescent neurons in the networks.

Phases of\nnodes within a splay cluster are equally spaced, but nodes in different splay\nclusters have an arbitrary phase difference that can be fixed or evolve\nlinearly in time. Such coexisting splay clusters form a decoupled state in that\nthe dynamical equations become effectively decoupled between oscillators that\ncan be physically coupled.

        "summary": "  Complex chemical reaction networks, which underlie many industrial and\nbiological processes, often exhibit non-monotonic changes in chemical species\nconcentrations, typically described using nonlinear models. Such non-monotonic\ndynamics are in principle possible even in linear models if the matrices\ndefining the models are non-normal, as characterized by a necessarily\nnon-orthogonal set of eigenvectors. However, the extent to which non-normality\nis responsible for non-monotonic behavior remains an open question. Here, using\na master equation to model the reaction dynamics, we derive a general condition\nfor observing non-monotonic dynamics of individual species, establishing that\nnon-normality promotes non-monotonicity but is not a requirement for it. In\ncontrast, we show that non-normality is a requirement for non-monotonic\ndynamics to be observed in the R\\'enyi entropy. Using hydrogen combustion as an\nexample application, we demonstrate that non-monotonic dynamics under\nexperimental conditions are supported by a linear chain of connected\ncomponents, in contrast with the dominance of a single giant component observed\nin typical random reaction networks. The exact linearity of the master equation\nenables development of rigorous theory and simulations for dynamical networks\nof unprecedented size (approaching $10^5$ dynamical variables, even for a\nnetwork of only 20 reactions and involving less than 100 atoms). Our\nconclusions are expected to hold for other combustion processes, and the\ngeneral theory we develop is applicable to all chemical reaction networks,\nincluding biological ones.\n",

The problem is that reversing the\ntopological damage, namely retrieving the lost nodes or links, or reinforcing\nthe weakened interactions, does not guarantee the spontaneous recovery to the\ndesired functional state. Indeed, many of the relevant systems exhibit a\nhysteresis phenomenon, remaining in the dysfunctional state, despite\nreconstructing their damaged topology. To address this challenge, we develop a\ntwo-step recovery scheme: first - topological reconstruction to the point where\nthe system can be revived, then dynamic interventions, to reignite the system's\nlost functionality. Applying this method to a range of nonlinear network\ndynamics, we identify the recoverable phase of a complex system, a state in\nwhich the system can be reignited by microscopic interventions, for instance,\ncontrolling just a single node.

It can be found in a\nbroad spectrum of applications, ranging from neuroscience to power-grids, to\nmention a few. Such systems synchronize because of the complex set of coupling\nthey exhibit, the latter being modeled by complex networks. The dynamical\nbehavior of the system and the topology of the underlying network are strongly\nintertwined, raising the question of the optimal architecture that makes\nsynchronization robust. The Master Stability Function (MSF) has been proposed\nand extensively studied as a generic framework to tackle synchronization\nproblems. Using this method, it has been shown that for a class of models,\nsynchronization in strongly directed networks is robust to external\nperturbations. In this paper, our approach is to transform the non-autonomous\nsystem of coupled oscillators into an autonomous one, showing that previous\nresults are model-independent. Recent findings indicate that many real-world\nnetworks are strongly directed, being potential candidates for optimal\nsynchronization. Inspired by the fact that highly directed networks are also\nstrongly non-normal, in this work, we address the matter of non-normality by\npointing out that standard techniques, such as the MSF, may fail in predicting\nthe stability of synchronized behavior. These results lead to a trade-off\nbetween non-normality and directedness that should be properly considered when\ndesigning an optimal network, enhancing the robustness of synchronization.\n",

Here we consider a network of Kuramoto\noscillators upon which the BTW model is unfolding, enabling us to study how the\nfeedback between the oscillatory and cascading dynamics can lead to new\nemergent behaviors. We assume that the more out-of-sync a node is with its\nneighbors the more vulnerable it is and lower its load-carrying capacity\naccordingly. And when a node topples and sheds load, its oscillatory phase is\nreset at random. This leads to novel cyclic behavior at an emergent, long\ntimescale. The system spends the bulk of its time in a synchronized state where\nload builds up with minimal cascades. Yet, eventually the system reaches a\ntipping point where a large cascade triggers a \"cascade of larger cascades,\"\nwhich can be classified as a Dragon King event. The system then undergoes a\nshort transient back to the synchronous, build-up phase. The coupling between\ncapacity and synchronization gives rise to endogenous cascade seeds in addition\nto the standard exogenous ones, and we show their respective roles. We\nestablish the phenomena from numerical studies and develop the accompanying\nmean-field theory to locate the tipping point, calculate the load in the\nsystem, determine the frequency of the long-time oscillations and find the\ndistribution of cascade sizes during the build-up phase.\n",

In addition to\na static layer, the (multiplex) epidemic network consists of a second dynamic\nlayer in which any two individuals are connected for the time they occupy the\nsame site during a random walk they perform on a separate transport network. We\ndevelop a mean-field description of the stochastic network model and study the\ninfluence the transport process has on the epidemic threshold.

In contrast, considering also random walks\nof fractional order that in some sense are a more realistic model of human\nmobility, we find that these non-local transport dynamics raise the epidemic\nthreshold in comparison to a classical local random walk.

We study STM cascades over\n``small-world'' models that contain both short- and long-range $k$-simplices,\nexploring how spatio-temporal patterns manifest as a frustration between local\nand nonlocal propagations. We show that higher-order coupling and nonlinear\nthresholding can coordinate to robustly guide cascades along a\nsimplicial-generalization of paths that we call $k$-dimensional ``geometrical\nchannels''. We also find this coordination to enhance the diversity and\nefficiency of cascades over a ``neuronal complex'', i.e., a\nsimplicial-complex-based model for a neuronal network. We support these\nfindings with bifurcation theory and a data-driven approach based on latent\ngeometry.

By leveraging fundamental theorems on singular\nvalue decomposition, we expose the hypothesis for various random graphs, either\nby making explicit their low-rank formulation or by demonstrating the\nexponential decrease of their singular values. Notably, we verify the\nhypothesis experimentally for real networks by revealing the rapid decrease of\ntheir singular values, which has major consequences on their effective ranks.\nWe then evaluate the impact of the low-rank hypothesis for general dynamical\nsystems on networks through an optimal dimension reduction. This allows us to\nprove that recurrent neural networks can be exactly reduced, and to connect the\nrapidly decreasing singular values of real networks to the dimension reduction\nerror of the nonlinear dynamics they support, be it microbial, neuronal or\nepidemiological.

We explore the effects of heterogeneous coupling phase-lags between\nthe two populations. Such heterogeneity arises naturally in various settings,\nfor example as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory\ninteractions, or as amplitude and phase responses of oscillators with\nelectrical or mechanical coupling. We find that breaking the phase-lag symmetry\nresults in a variety of states with uniform and non-uniform synchronization,\nincluding in-phase and anti-phase synchrony, full incoherence (splay state),\nchimeras with phase separation of $0$ or $\\pi$ between populations, and states\nwhere both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states\nexhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify\nthe bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and\ndesynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag\nparameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase,\nanti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near\n$\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (cosine coupling).

We report this behavior in the slow oscillation regime exhibited by a\ncerebral cortex network under dynamical conditions resembling slow-wave sleep\nand anaesthesia. Computational analysis of a biologically realistic network\nmodel reveals that an intermediate level of background noise leads to\nquasi-regular dynamics. We verify this prediction experimentally in cortical\nslices subject to varying amounts of extracellular potassium, which modulates\nneuronal excitability and thus synaptic noise. The model also predicts that\nthis effectively regular state should exhibit noise-induced memory of the\nspatial propagation profile of the collective oscillations, which is also\nverified experimentally.

In this paper, we hope to bridge that gap\nby reviewing common barriers to open-endedness in the evolution-inspired\napproach and how they are dealt with in the evolutionary case - collapse of\ndiversity, saturation of complexity, and failure to form new kinds of\nindividuality. We then show how these problems map onto similar issues in the\nmachine learning approach, and discuss how the same insights and solutions\nwhich alleviated those barriers in evolutionary approaches can be ported over.\nAt the same time, the form these issues take in the machine learning\nformulation suggests new ways to analyze and resolve barriers to\nopen-endedness. Ultimately, we hope to inspire researchers to be able to\ninterchangeably use evolutionary and gradient-descent-based machine learning\nmethods to approach the design and creation of open-ended systems.\n",

From an application point of\nview, while the multirhythmicity is sometimes desirable as it presents us with\nmany possible coexisting stable oscillatory states to tap into, it can also be\na nuisance because a random perturbation may make the system settle onto an\nunwanted stable state. Consequently, it is not surprising that there are many\nnatural and artificial mechanisms available that can control the\nmultirhythmicity. We propose in this paper the idea of incorporating parametric\n(periodic) modulation of the nonlinear damping in the limit cycle oscillators\nwith a view to exciting resonance and antiresonance responses at particular\nangular driving frequencies, and controlling the resulting birhythmicity by\nchanging the amplitude of the modulation. To this end, we employ analytical\n(perturbative) and numerical techniques on the van der Pol oscillator---a\nparadigmatic limit cycle system---having additional position dependent time\ndelay term and its modified autonomous birhythmic version. We also bring the\nfact to the fore that introduction of delay---a commonly adopted method of\ncontrolling multirhythmicity---in such a system can sometimes bring forth\nunwanted birhythmicity; and interestingly, our method of controlling\nbirhythmicity through periodic modulation can suppress such a delay induced\nbirhythmic response.\n",

In\nthis paper, we consider the replicator equation for two-player-two-strategy\ngames involving cooperators and defectors. We modify the equation to include\nthe effect of mutation and also delay that corresponds either to the delayed\ninformation about the population state or in realizing the effect of\ninteraction among players. By focusing on the four exhaustive classes of\nsymmetrical games -- the Stag Hunt game, the Snowdrift game, the Prisoners'\nDilemma game, and the Harmony game -- we analytically and numerically analyze\ndelayed replicator-mutator equation to find the explicit condition for the Hopf\nbifurcation bringing forth stable limit cycle. The existence of the\nasymptotically stable limit cycle imply the coexistence of the cooperators and\nthe defectors; and in the games, where defection is a stable Nash strategy, a\nstable limit cycle does provide a mechanism for evolution of cooperation. We\nfind that while mutation alone can never lead to oscillatory cooperation state\nin two-player-two-strategy games, the delay can change the scenario. On the\nother hand, there are situations when delay alone cannot lead to the Hopf\nbifurcation in the absence of mutation in the selection dynamics.\n",

In\nthis work, we propose a stochastic generalization of the Schelling model, based\non both race and wealth, to understand how carefully architected placement of\nincentives, such as urban infrastructure, might affect segregation. In our\nmodel, each agent is assigned one of two colors along with a label, rich or\npoor. Further, we designate certain vertices on the lattice as \"urban sites,\"\nproviding civic infrastructure that most benefits the poorer population, thus\nincentivizing the occupation of such vertices by poor agents of either color.\nWe look at the stationary distribution of a Markov process reflecting these\npreferences to understand the long-term effects. We prove that when incentives\nare large enough, we will have \"urbanization of poverty,\" an observed effect\nwhereby poor people tend to congregate on urban sites. Moreover, even when\nhomophily preferences are very small, if the incentives are large and there is\nincome inequality in the two-color classes, we can get racial segregation on\nurban sites but integration on non-urban sites. In contrast, we find overall\nmitigation of segregation when the urban sites are distributed throughout the\nlattice and the incentives for urban sites exceed the homophily biases.

        "summary": "  The tragedy of the commons (TOC) is an unfortunate situation where a shared\nresource is exhausted due to uncontrolled exploitation by the selfish\nindividuals of a population. Recently, the paradigmatic replicator equation has\nbeen used in conjunction with a phenomenological equation for the state of the\nshared resource to gain insight into the influence of the games on the TOC. The\nreplicator equation, by construction, models a fixed infinite population\nundergoing microevolution. Thus, it is unable to capture any effect of the\npopulation growth and the carrying capacity of the population although the TOC\nis expected to be dependent on the size of the population. Therefore, in this\npaper, we present a mathematical framework that incorporates the density\ndependent payoffs and the logistic growth of the population in the\neco-evolutionary dynamics modelling the game-resource feedback. We discover a\nbistability in the dynamics: a finite carrying capacity can either avert or\ncause the TOC depending on the initial states of the resource and the initial\nfraction of cooperators. In fact, depending on the type of strategic\ngame-theoretic interaction, a finite carrying capacity can either avert or\ncause the TOC when it is exactly the opposite for the corresponding case with\ninfinite carrying capacity.\n",

Leveraging this\nwinding partition, we accompany this article with an algorithms to compute all\nsynchronous solutions of complex networks of dissipatively coupled oscillators.\nThese geometric and computational tools allow us to identify anomalous\nbehaviors of lossy networked systems. Counterintuitively, we show that loop\nflows and dissipation can increase the system's transfer capacity, and that\ndissipation can promote multistability.

In terms of a minimum turning angle\nintroduced to define a large change, avalanches are characterized by\ndistributions of size and duration showing scale-free signatures, reminiscent\nof self-organized critical behavior. We observe that avalanches are generally\ntriggered by a small number of fish, which act as effective leaders that induce\nlarge rearrangements of the group's trajectory. This observation motivates the\nproposal of a simple model, based in the classical Vicsek model of collective\nmotion, in which a given individual acts as a leader subject to random heading\nreorientations. The model reproduces qualitatively the empirical avalanche\nbehavior observed in real schools, and hints towards a connection between\neffective leadership and avalanche behavior in collective movement.\n",

For the analysis, we use\nthe well-known multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis in two dimensions.\nWe find that radio data exhibit long-range correlations, as expected from the\nunderlying physics of the supernova explosion and evolution. The correlations\nfollow a power-law scaling with length scales. The structural complexity is\nfound to be multifractal in nature, as evidenced by the dependence of the\ngeneralized Hurst exponent on the order of the moments of the detrended\nfluctuation function. By repeating the analysis on shuffled data, we further\nprobe the origin of the multifractality in the radio imaging data. For the\nradio data, we find that the probability density function is close to a\nGaussian form. Hence, the multifractal behavior is due to the differing nature\nof long-range correlations of the large and small detrended fluctuation field\nvalues. We investigate the multifractal parameters across different partitions\nof the radio image and find that the structures across the image are highly\nheterogeneous, making the Crab Nebula a structurally complex astrophysical\nsystem.

Using a two-population model of coupled\noscillators that integrates the central clock and the peripheral clocks, we\nderive simple mean-field equations that can capture many aspects of the rich\nbehavior found in the mammalian circadian system. We focus on three\nage-associated effects which have been posited to contribute to circadian\nmisalignment: attenuated input from the sympathetic pathway, reduced\nresponsiveness to light, and a decline in the expression of neurotransmitters.\nWe find that the first two factors can significantly impede re-entrainment of\nthe clocks following a perturbation, while a weaker coupling within the central\nclock does not affect the recovery rate. Moreover, using our minimal model, we\ndemonstrate the potential of using the feed-fast cycle as an effective\nintervention to accelerate circadian re-entrainment.

We show that increasing the change rate and starting the drift\nfurther from the bifurcation can delay the tipping process.

Extensive research has\nbeen performed in various systems, focusing on a system of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi\n(KS) phase oscillators. In recent developments, the system has been extended to\nthe so-called generalized Kuramoto model, wherein an oscillator is situated on\nthe surface of an M-dimensional unit sphere, rather than being confined to a\nunit circle. In this paper, we exploit the model introduced in New. J. Phys.\n16, 023016 (2014) where the macroscopic dynamics of the system was studied\nusing the extended Watanabe-Strogatz transformation both for real and complex\nspaces. Considering two-population networks of the generalized KS oscillators\nin 2D complex spaces, we demonstrate the existence of chimera states and\nelucidate different motions of the order parameter vectors depending on the\nstrength of intra-population coupling. Similar to the KS model on the unit\ncircle, stationary and breathing chimeras are observed for comparatively strong\nintra-population coupling. Here, the breathing chimera changes their motion\nupon decreasing intra-population coupling strength via a global bifurcation\ninvolving the completely incoherent state. Beyond that, the system exhibits\nperiodic alternation of the two order parameters with weaker coupling strength.\nMoreover, we observe that the chimera state transitions into a componentwise\naperiodic dynamics when the coupling strength weakens even further. The\naperiodic chimera dynamics emerges due to the breaking of conserved quantities\nthat are preserved in the stationary, breathing and alternating chimera states.\nWe provide a detailed explanation of this scenario in both the thermodynamic\nlimit and for finite-sized ensembles. Furthermore, we note that an ensemble in\n4D real spaces demonstrates similar behavior.\n",

Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized, local\ninteractions among constituent components (e.g., individual fish in a school).\nPreeminent models of this process describe individuals as self-propelled\nparticles, subject to self-generated motion and 'social forces' such as\nshort-range repulsion and long-range attraction or alignment. However,\norganisms are not particles; they are probabilistic decision-makers. Here, we\nintroduce an approach to modelling collective behavior based on active\ninference. This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a\nsingle imperative: to minimize surprise. We demonstrate that many\nempirically-observed collective phenomena, including cohesion, milling and\ndirected motion, emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active\nBayesian inference -- without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals\ninto individual agents. Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover\nand generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to\nsuppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations. By exploring\nthe parameter space of the belief-based model, we reveal non-trivial\nrelationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like\npolarization and the tendency to visit different collective states. We also\nexplore how individual beliefs about uncertainty determine collective\ndecision-making accuracy.

The higher-order interactions favour the formation of two cluster\nstates, which emerge from the incoherent regime via continuous (discontinouos)\ntransitions for unimodal (bimodal) distributions. Fully synchronized initial\nstates give rise to two symmetric equally populated bimodal clusters, each\ncharacterized by either positive or negative natural frequencies. These bimodal\nclusters are formed at an angular distance $\\gamma$, which increases for\ndecreasing pair-wise couplings until it reaches $\\gamma=\\pi$ (corresponding to\nan anti-phase configuration), where the cluster state destabilizes via an\nabrupt transition: the $\\pi$-transition.

We explore how the shape of the network's degree distribution affects the\nonset of synchronization and derive an expression based on the network's\nconstruction that determines the expected time for a network to synchronize.\nUnderstanding how the network structure affects the spark of synchronization is\nparticularly important for the control and design of more robust systems that\nrequire some level of coherence between a subset of units for better\nfunctioning. Numerical simulations in finite-sized networks are consistent with\nthis analysis.\n",

This paper presents a random\npiecewise smooth map derived from a simple inductor-less switching circuit. The\nbifurcation parameter is bounded and randomly selected from a stationary\ndistribution. Due to the stochasticity inherent in either the parameter values\nor the state variable, the time evolution of the state variable cannot be\npredicted at a specific time instant. We observe that the state variable\nexhibits completely ergodic behavior when the minimum value of the parameter is\n2.0. However, the ensemble average of the state variable converges to a fixed\nvalue. For parameter values ranging from 2.0 to 3.5, the system demonstrates\nnonchaotic behavior, and the absolute value of the Lyapunov exponent increases\nmonotonically with the asymmetry (ap) of the distribution from which the\nbifurcation parameter values are sampled. We determine the probability density\nfunction of the random map and verify its invariance under any initial\ncondition. The most noteworthy result is the disappearance of chaotic behavior\nwhen the lower range of the distribution is varied while maintaining a fixed\nupper threshold for a particular distribution, even though the nonrandom map\nexhibits an array of periodic and chaotic behaviors within that range.\n",

In particular, the so called needle region, in\nparameter space, for Adler-type oscillators with nearest neighbors coupling is\ncarefully characterized.

Entropic measures further emphasize the region's heterogeneous\nnature with interesting features, as seen in the spatiotemporal diagrams. The\noccurrence of wave-like patterns in the spatiotemporal diagrams points to\nnon-trivial correlations in both dimensions.

Reservoirs with high K have two optimal balances,\none for globally inhibitory networks (b<0), and the other one for excitatory\nnetworks (b>0). Both show asymmetric performances about a zero balance.

        "summary": "  A central question of network science is how functional properties of systems\narise from their structure. For networked dynamical systems, structure is\ntypically quantified with network measures. A functional property that is of\ntheoretical and practical interest for oscillatory systems is the stability of\nsynchrony to localized perturbations. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nhave been shown to predict this stability successfully; at the same time,\nnetwork measures have struggled to paint a clear picture. Here we collect 46\nrelevant network measures and find that no small subset can reliably predict\nstability. The performance of GNNs can only be matched by combining all network\nmeasures and nodewise machine learning. However, unlike GNNs, this approach\nfails to extrapolate from network ensembles to several real power grid\ntopologies. This suggests that correlations of network measures and function\nmay be misleading, and that GNNs capture the causal relationship between\nstructure and stability substantially better.\n",

Phase oscillators\nare particularly useful in the modelling of the synchronization dynamics of\nsuch systems.

Here, we focus on the case where\nsynchronized oscillators are divided into a fast and a slow component so that\nthe two subsets evolve on separated timescales. We assess the resilience of the\nslow component by reducing the dynamics of the fast one and evaluating the\nvariance of the phase deviations when the oscillators in the two components are\nsubject to noise with possibly distinct correlation times. From the general\nexpression for the variance, we consider specific network structures and show\nhow the noise transmission between the fast and slow components is affected.\nInterestingly, we find that oscillators that are among the most robust when\nthere is only a single timescale, might become the most vulnerable when the\nsystem separates into two timescales.

Most of such systems are driven\nby irregular and distributed fluctuating input signals from the environment.\nYet how networked dynamical systems collectively respond to such fluctuations\ndepends on the location and type of driving signal, the interaction topology\nand several other factors and remains largely unknown to date. As a key\nexample, modern electric power grids are undergoing a rapid and systematic\ntransformation towards more sustainable systems, signified by high penetrations\nof renewable energy sources.

How power grid systems dynamically respond to fluctuating\npower feed-in as well as other temporal changes is critical for ensuring a\nreliable operation of power grids yet not well understood. In this work, we\nsystematically introduce a linear response theory for fluctuation-driven\nnetworked dynamical systems.

Classical vibrational\nresonance examines the response of a nonlinear system excited by two signals: a\nweak, slowly varying characteristic signal, and a fast-varying auxiliary\nsignal. The characteristic signal operates on a much longer time scale than the\nauxiliary signal. Through the cooperation of the nonlinear system and these two\nexcitations, the faint input can be substantially amplified, showcasing the\nconstructive role of the fast-varying signal. Since its inception, vibrational\nresonance has been extensively studied across various disciplines, including\nphysics, mathematics, biology, neuroscience, laser science, chemistry, and\nengineering. Here, we delve into a detailed discussion of vibrational resonance\nand the most recent advances, beginning with an introduction to characteristic\nsignals commonly used in its study. Furthermore, we compile numerous nonlinear\nmodels where vibrational resonance has been observed to enhance readers'\nunderstanding and provide a basis for comparison.

In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between\nintrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$\ndynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and\nstatistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate\nthe stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and\nSC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$\nand illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis\nelucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation\nthan the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of\ncytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds\nof the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying\ncomplexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When\nadjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks\nin an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we\nidentify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which\nare further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis.

The pedestrian fundamental diagram (FD), which describes the\nrelationship between pedestrian flow and density within a given space,\ncharacterizes these dynamics. Pedestrian FDs are significantly influenced by\nthe flow type, such as uni-directional, bi-directional, and crossing flows.\nHowever, to the authors' knowledge, generalized pedestrian FDs that are\napplicable to various flow types have not been proposed. This may be due to the\ndifficulty of using statistical methods to characterize the flow types. The\nflow types significantly depend on the angles of pedestrian movement; however,\nthese angles cannot be processed by standard statistics due to their\nperiodicity. In this study, we propose a comprehensive model for pedestrian FDs\nthat can describe the pedestrian dynamics for various flow types by applying\nDirectional Statistics.

The fixed points of\nthe oscillator have been evaluated analytically and the Jacobian linearization\nis employed to study their stability. We find that on increasing the amplitude\nof the external periodic drive, the system exhibits period-doubling cascade to\nchaos within a specific parametric regime wherein we observe emergent chaotic\ndynamics. We further notice that the system indicates an intermittency route to\nchaos in the chaotic regime. Finally, in the period-4 regime of our bifurcation\nanalysis, we predict the emergence of transient chaos which eventually settles\ndown to a period-2 oscillator response which has been further validated by both\nthe maximal Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) using the well-known\nGram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique and the Hilbert Transform of the\ntime-series. In the transiently chaotic regime, we deploy the ICO learning to\nanalyze the time-series from which we identify that when the chaotic evolution\ntransforms into periodic dynamics, the synaptic weight associated with the\ntime-series of the loss oscillator exhibits stationary temporal evolution. This\nsignifies that in the periodic regime, there is no overlap between the filtered\nsignals obtained from the time-series of the coupled PT-symmetric oscillators.\nIn addition, the temporal evolution of the weight associated with the stimulus\nmimics the behaviour of the Hilbert transform of the time-series.\n",

This new synchronization phenomenon,\nwhich is named ``scalable synchronization cluster\", is explored theoretically\nby the method of eigenvector-based analysis, and it is revealed that the\nscalability of the cluster is attributed to the unique feature of the\neigenvectors of the network coupling matrix. The transient dynamics of the\ncluster in response to random perturbations are also studied, and it is shown\nthat in restoring to the synchronization state, oscillators inside the cluster\nare stabilized in sequence, illustrating again the hierarchy of the\noscillators.

Based on\nthe assumption of time-scale separation between a fast contagion process and a\nslower movement response, the underlying interaction networks have been\npreviously assumed to be static, determined by the spatial structure at the\nonset of the collective escape response. This idealization does not account for\nthe temporal evolution of the spatial network structure, which may have a major\nimpact on the behavioral contagion dynamics. Here, we propose a\nspatially-explicit, agent-based model for the coupling between behavioral\ncontagion and the network dynamics originating from the spreading movement\nresponse. We explore the impact of movement parameters (startle speed, initial\ndirectionality, and directional noise) on average cascade size. By conducting\nnumerical simulations for different density levels, we show that increasing\nescape speed suppresses the cascade size in most cases, that the cascade size\ndepends strongly on the movement direction of the initially startled\nindividual, and that large variability in the direction of individual escape\nmovements (rotational noise) will typically promote the spread of behavioral\ncontagion through spatial groups.

Here, we\nrevisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over\nthe past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the\nrobustness of those results using the greater computing resources available\ntoday. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system,\ndemonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility.\nSpecifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently\nthan previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse\ninto trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily\ncombined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the\nrandom generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of\nobjects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on\nthe results.

This study develops a dynamic model of platform\nselection, extending Social Feedback Theory by incorporating multi-agent\nreinforcement learning to capture how user decisions are shaped by past rewards\nacross different platforms. A key parameter ($\\mu$) in the model governs users'\ntendencies to either seek approval from like-minded peers or engage with\nopposing views. Our findings reveal that online environments can evolve into\nsuboptimal states characterized by polarized, strongly opinionated echo\nchambers, even when users prefer diverse perspectives. Interestingly, this\npolarizing state coexists with another equilibrium, where users gravitate\ntoward a single dominant platform, marginalizing other platforms into\nextremity. Using agent-based simulations and dynamical systems analysis, our\nmodel underscores the complex interplay of user preferences and platform\ndynamics, offering insights into how digital spaces might be better managed to\nfoster diverse discourse.\n",

However, there are scenarios where synchronization disrupts a\nsystem's proper functioning, necessitating mechanisms to control or suppress\nit. While several methods exist for controlling synchronization in\nnon-spatially embedded oscillators, to the best of our knowledge no such\nstrategies have been developed for swarmalators (oscillators that\nsimultaneously move in space and synchronize in time). In this work, we address\nthis gap by introducing a novel control strategy based on Hamiltonian control\ntheory to suppress synchronization in a system of swarmalators confined to a\none-dimensional space. The numerical investigations we performed, demonstrate\nthat the proposed control strategy effectively suppresses synchronized dynamics\nwithin the swarmalator population. We studied the impact of the number of\ncontrolled swarmalators as well as the strength of the control term, in its\noriginal form and in a simplified one.\n",

These mechanisms introduce additional\ncomplexity through the intricate connectivity of interacting elements within\nthe network and the intrinsic dynamics, which are governed by nonlinear\nprocesses with diverse parameters and higher dimensionality of systems. Over\nthe past 25 years, extensive research has focused on determining the MSF for\npairwise coupled identical systems with diffusive coupling. Our literature\nsurvey highlights two significant advancements in recent years: the\nconsideration of multilayer networks instead of single-layer networks and the\nextension of MSF analysis to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside\npairwise interactions.\n  In this review article, we revisit the analysis of the MSF for diffusively\npairwise coupled dynamical systems and extend this framework to more general\ncoupling schemes. Furthermore, we systematically derive the MSF for multilayer\ndynamical networks and single-layer coupled systems by incorporating\nhigher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. The primary focus of\nour review is on the analytical derivation and numerical computation of the MSF\nfor complex dynamical networks.

We focus on the important convergence to\ncriticality and show that noise and time-scale optimality are reached at finite\nvalues. This is in sharp contrast to the previously believed optimal zero noise\nand infinite time scale separation case. Furthermore, we discover a noise\ninduced phase transition for the breakdown of SOC. We also investigate each of\nthe three new effects separately by developing models.

Such a special case is studied here { synchronization\ntransition occurs only due to the time-variability of the coupling functions,\nwhile the net coupling strength is constant throughout the observation time.

Its robust realization is crucial to our understanding of\nvarious nonlinear systems, ranging from biological functions to electrical\nengineering. On another front, in condensed matter physics, topology is\nutilized to realize robust properties like topological edge modes, as\ndemonstrated by celebrated topological insulators. Here, we integrate these two\nresearch avenues and propose a nonlinear topological phenomenon, namely\ntopological synchronization, where only the edge oscillators synchronize while\nthe bulk ones exhibit chaotic dynamics. We analyze concrete prototypical models\nto demonstrate the presence of positive Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov vectors\nlocalized along the edge. As a unique characteristic of topology in nonlinear\nsystems, we find that unconventional extra topological boundary modes appear at\nemerging effective boundaries. Furthermore, our proposal shows promise for\nspatially controlling synchronization, such as on-demand pattern designing and\ndefect detection. The topological synchronization can ubiquitously appear in\ntopological nonlinear oscillators and thus can provide a guiding principle to\nrealize synchronization in a robust, geometrical, and flexible way.\n",

Much of the focus for control has been on desynchronization of\nan oscillator population, motivated by the pathological neural synchrony\npresent in essential and parkinsonian tremor. Other applications, such as the\nbeating of the heart and insulin secretion, require synchronization, and\nrecently there has been interest in forming clusters within an oscillator\npopulation as well. In this article, we use a formulation that allows us to\ndevise control frameworks to achieve all of these distinct collective behaviors\nobserved in biological oscillators. This is based on the Fourier decomposition\nof the partial differential equation governing the evolution of the phase\ndistribution of a population of identical, uncoupled oscillators. Our first two\ncontrol algorithms are Lyapunov-based, which work by decreasing a positive\ndefinite Lyapunov function towards zero. Our third control is an optimal\ncontrol algorithm, which minimizes the control energy consumption while\nachieving the desired collective behavior of an oscillator population.\nMotivated by pathological neural synchrony, we apply our control to\ndesynchronize an initially synchronized neural population. Given the proposed\nimportance of enhancing spike time dependent plasticity to stabilize neural\nclusters and counteract pathological neural synchronization, we formulate the\nphase difference distribution in terms of the phase distribution, and prove\nsome of its fundamental properties, and in turn apply our control to transform\nthe neural phase distribution to form clusters.

Yet, previous modeling work on agent\nlearning and decision-making either lacks a systematic way to describe this\nsource of uncertainty or puts the focus on obtaining optimal policies using\ncomplex models of the world that would impose an unrealistically high cognitive\ndemand on real agents. In this work we aim to efficiently describe the emergent\nbehavior of biologically plausible and parsimonious learning agents faced with\npartially observable worlds. Therefore we derive and present deterministic\nreinforcement learning dynamics where the agents observe the true state of the\nenvironment only partially. We showcase the broad applicability of our dynamics\nacross different classes of partially observable agent-environment systems. We\nfind that partial observability creates unintuitive benefits in a number of\nspecific contexts, pointing the way to further research on a general\nunderstanding of such effects. For instance, partially observant agents can\nlearn better outcomes faster, in a more stable way and even overcome social\ndilemmas. Furthermore, our method allows the application of dynamical systems\ntheory to partially observable multiagent leaning. In this regard we find the\nemergence of catastrophic limit cycles, a critical slowing down of the learning\nprocesses between reward regimes and the separation of the learning dynamics\ninto fast and slow directions, all caused by partial observability. Therefore,\nthe presented dynamics have the potential to become a formal, yet practical,\nlightweight and robust tool for researchers in biology, social science and\nmachine learning to systematically investigate the effects of interacting\npartially observant agents.\n",

Despite the\ndiversity of physical processes observed in a broad range of applications, the\nunderlying instabilities observed in practice have a universal characterization\nwhich is determined by the overall gain and loss curves of a given system. The\nuniversal behavior of damped-driven systems can be understood from a\ngeometrical description of the energy balance with a minimal number of\nassumptions. The assumptions on the energy dynamics are as follows: the energy\nincreases monotonically as a function of increasing gain, and the losses become\nincreasingly larger with increasing energy, i.e. there are many routes for\ndissipation in the system for large input energy. The intersection of the gain\nand loss curves define an energy balanced solution.

Indeed, the loss and gain curves allow for a geometrical description of\nthe dynamics through a simple Verhulst diagram (cobweb plot).

In this context a less\nexplored phenomenon is self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR). Unlike CR,\nSISR may arise away from the bifurcation threshold and the properties of the\ninduced oscillations depend upon both the noise intensity and the time-scale\nseparation factor. In this work, we report a new chimera pattern in a network\nof coupled excitable units, namely the self-induced stochastic resonance\nchimera or SISR-chimera that originates from the SISR phenomenon. We explore\nthe detailed dynamics of the SISR-chimera in the parameter space using proper\nquantitative measures. We have found that unlike CR chimera, the SISR-chimera\npattern strongly depends upon the ratio of time scale and noise intensity.\nTherefore, this type of chimera pattern can be induced even for a tiny noise\nintensity if the time scale separation of the activator and inhibitor is large\nenough.\n",

Examples of triadic\ninteractions are present in the brain when glia modulate the synaptic signals\namong neuron pairs or when interneuron axon-axonic synapses enable presynaptic\ninhibition and facilitation, and in ecosystems when one or more species can\naffect the interaction among two other species. On random graphs, triadic\npercolation has been recently shown to turn percolation into a fully-fledged\ndynamical process in which the size of the giant component undergoes a route to\nchaos. However, in many real cases, triadic interactions are local and occur on\nspatially embedded networks. Here we show that triadic interactions in spatial\nnetworks induce a very complex spatio-temporal modulation of the giant\ncomponent which gives rise to triadic percolation patterns with significantly\ndifferent topology. We classify the observed patterns (stripes, octopus, and\nsmall clusters) with topological data analysis and we assess their information\ncontent (entropy and complexity). Moreover, we illustrate the multistability of\nthe dynamics of the triadic percolation patterns and we provide a comprehensive\nphase diagram of the model. These results open new perspectives in percolation\nas they demonstrate that in presence of spatial triadic interactions, the giant\ncomponent can acquire a time-varying topology. Hence, this work provides a\ntheoretical framework that can be applied to model realistic scenarios in which\nthe giant component is time-dependent as in neuroscience.\n",

We consider in particular hypergraphs with\nhigher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the\nhyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory\ninteraction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two\nother nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit\nsynaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may\nnot only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also\nbetween regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to\nhigher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction\nnetworks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here\nwe propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs\nshowing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this\npercolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component,\nundergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In\nhierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order\nto treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the\nnon-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical\nphenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider\nother generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering\ninterdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.\n",

We show that the measures are useful to identify and\ncharacterize different dynamical phases. It becomes clear that different\noperation regimes are required for different traffic demands. Thus, not only\ntraffic is a non-stationary problem, which requires controllers to adapt\nconstantly. Controllers must also change drastically the complexity of their\nbehavior depending on the demand. Based on our measures, we can say that the\nself-organizing method achieves an adaptability level comparable to a living\nsystem.\n",

Different outcomes are observed\ndepending on the predator strength. For a \"weak\" predator, the swarm is able to\nescape the predator completely. As the strength is increased, the predator is\nable to catch up with the swarm as a whole, but the individual prey are able to\nescape by \"confusing\" the predator: the prey forms a ring with the predator at\nthe center. For higher predator strength, complex chasing dynamics are observed\nwhich can become chaotic. For even higher strength, the predator is able to\nsuccessfully capture the prey. Our model is simple enough to be amenable to a\nfull mathematical analysis which is used to predict the shape of the swarm as\nwell as the resulting predator-prey dynamics as a function of model parameters.\nWe show that as the predator strength is increased, there is a transition (due\nto a Hopf bifurcation) from confusion state to chasing dynamics, and we compute\nthe threshold analytically. Our analysis indicates that the swarming behaviour\nis not helpful in avoiding the predator, suggesting that there are other\nreasons why the species may swarm. The complex shape of the swarm in our model\nduring the chasing dynamics is similar to the shape of a flock of sheep\navoiding a shepherd.\n",

However, in some situations, the formation\nof a coherent state is damaging. In this article we study a repulsive\nmean-field Kuramoto model that describes the time evolution of n points on the\nunit circle, which are transformed into incoherent phase-locked states. It has\nbeen recently shown that such systems can be reduced to a three-dimensional\nsystem of ordinary differential equations, whose mathematical structure is\nstrongly related to hyperbolic geometry. The orbits of the Kuramoto dynamical\nsystem are then described by a ow of M\\\"obius transformations. We show this\nunderlying dynamic performs statistical inference by computing dynamically\nM-estimates of scatter matrices. We also describe the limiting phase-locked\nstates for random initial conditions using Tyler's transformation matrix.\nMoreover, we show the repulsive Kuramoto model performs dynamically not only\nrobust covariance matrix estimation, but also data processing: the initial\nconfiguration of the n points is transformed by the dynamic into a limiting\nphase-locked state that surprisingly equals the spatial signs from\nnonparametric statistics. That makes the sign empirical covariance matrix to\nequal 1 2 id2, the variance-covariance matrix of a random vector that is\nuniformly distributed on the unit circle.\n",

So far, the\nchoice between simplicial complexes and hypergraphs has often been motivated by\ntechnical convenience. Here, using synchronization as an example, we\ndemonstrate that the effects of higher-order interactions are highly\nrepresentation-dependent. In particular, higher-order interactions typically\nenhance synchronization in hypergraphs but have the opposite effect in\nsimplicial complexes. We provide theoretical insight by linking the\nsynchronizability of different hypergraph structures to (generalized) degree\nheterogeneity and cross-order degree correlation, which in turn influence a\nwide range of dynamical processes from contagion to diffusion.

Here, we identify\nnetwork structural properties underlying the pervasiveness of nonnormality and\nreactivity in real directed networks, which we establish using the most\nextensive data set of such networks studied in this context to date. The\nidentified properties are imbalances between incoming and outgoing network\nlinks and paths at each node. Based on this characterization, we develop a\ntheory that quantitatively predicts nonnormality and reactivity and explains\nthe observed pervasiveness. We suggest that these results can be used to\ndesign, upgrade, control, and manage networks to avoid or promote network\ninstabilities.\n",
