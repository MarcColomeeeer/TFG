Classically, CA are run on a regular lattice and with perfect\nsynchronicity. However, these two assumptions have little chance to truthfully\nrepresent what happens at the microscopic scale for physical, biological or\nsocial systems. One may thus wonder whether CA do keep their behavior when\nsubmitted to small perturbations of synchronicity.\n  This work focuses on the study of one-dimensional (1D) asynchronous CA with\ntwo states and nearest-neighbors. We define what we mean by ``the behavior of\nCA is robust to asynchronism'' using a statistical approach with macroscopic\nparameters. and we present an experimental protocol aimed at finding which are\nthe robust 1D elementary CA. To conclude, we examine how the results exposed\ncan be used as a guideline for the research of suitable models according to\nrobustness criteria.\n",

Systems of BDEs can be\nclassified into conservative or dissipative, in a manner that parallels the\nclassification of ordinary or partial differential equations. Solutions to\ncertain conservative BDEs exhibit growth of complexity in time. They represent\ntherewith metaphors for biological evolution or human history. Dissipative BDEs\nare structurally stable and exhibit multiple equilibria and limit cycles, as\nwell as more complex, fractal solution sets, such as Devil's staircases and\n``fractal sunbursts``. All known solutions of dissipative BDEs have stationary\nvariance. BDE systems of this type, both free and forced, have been used as\nhighly idealized models of climate change on interannual, interdecadal and\npaleoclimatic time scales. BDEs are also being used as flexible, highly\nefficient models of colliding cascades in earthquake modeling and prediction,\nas well as in genetics. In this paper we review the theory of systems of BDEs\nand illustrate their applications to climatic and solid earth problems. The\nformer have used small systems of BDEs, while the latter have used large\nnetworks of BDEs. We moreover introduce BDEs with an infinite number of\nvariables distributed in space (``partial BDEs``) and discuss connections with\nother types of dynamical systems, including cellular automata and Boolean\nnetworks.

The two kinds of presentation share many traits but also display\nprofound differences on issues ranging from decidability to modeling\nconvenience and physical implementability.\n  Following a conjecture by Toffoli and Margolus, it had been proved by Kari\n(and by Durand--Lose for more than two dimensions) that any invertible CA can\nbe rewritten as an LG (with a possibly much more complex ``unit cell''). But\nuntil now it was not known whether this is possible in general for\nnoninvertible CA--which comprise ``almost all'' CA and represent the bulk of\nexamples in theory and applications.

Under appropriate\nconditions on the measurement matrix, the entire information about the original\nsparse vector is captured in the measurements, and can be recovered using\nefficient polynomial methods. The vector model has been extended to a finite\nset of sparse vectors sharing a common non-zero location set. In this paper, we\ntreat a broader framework in which the goal is to recover a possibly infinite\nset of jointly sparse vectors. Extending existing recovery methods to this\nmodel is difficult due to the infinite structure of the sparse vector set.\nInstead, we prove that the entire infinite set of sparse vectors can recovered\nby solving a single, reduced-size finite-dimensional problem, corresponding to\nrecovery of a finite set of sparse vectors. We then show that the problem can\nbe further reduced to the basic recovery of a single sparse vector by randomly\ncombining the measurement vectors. Our approach results in exact recovery of\nboth countable and uncountable sets as it does not rely on discretization or\nheuristic techniques. To efficiently recover the single sparse vector produced\nby the last reduction step, we suggest an empirical boosting strategy that\nimproves the recovery ability of any given sub-optimal method for recovering a\nsparse vector. Numerical experiments on random data demonstrate that when\napplied to infinite sets our strategy outperforms discretization techniques in\nterms of both run time and empirical recovery rate. In the finite model, our\nboosting algorithm is characterized by fast run time and superior recovery rate\nthan known popular methods.\n",

When the BBM is initialized appropriately, the\nsequence of states that appear at successive integer time-steps is equivalent\nto a discrete digital dynamics. Here we discuss some models of computation that\nare based on the elastic collisions of identical finite-diameter soft spheres:\nspheres which are very compressible and hence take an appreciable amount of\ntime to bounce off each other. Because of this extended impact period, these\nSoft Sphere Models (SSM's) correspond directly to simple lattice gas\nautomata--unlike the fast-impact BBM. Successive time-steps of an SSM lattice\ngas dynamics can be viewed as integer-time snapshots of a continuous physical\ndynamics with a finite-range soft-potential interaction. We present both 2D and\n3D models of universal CA's of this type, and then discuss spatially-efficient\ncomputation using momentum conserving versions of these models (i.e., without\nfixed mirrors). Finally, we discuss the interpretation of these models as\nrelativistic and as semi-classical systems, and extensions of these models\nmotivated by these interpretations.\n",

        "summary": "  Modeling the immune system so that its essential functionalities stand out\nwithout the need for every molecular or cellular interaction to be taken into\naccount has been challenging for many decades. Two competing approaches have\nbeen the clonal selection theory and the idiotypic-network theory, each\nstemming from a relatively separate set of principles. One recent perspective\nholding the promise of unification is that of immunity as computation, that is,\nof immunity as the process of computing the state of the body so that\nprotection can be effected, as well as boosted through learning. Here we\ninvestigate the use of cellular automata (CA) as the core abstraction\nsupporting this new perspective. Our choice of CA for this role is based on the\npotential variety of basins in a CA attractor field. Associating each basin\nwith a consistent set of body states, and moreover providing for the noisy\nevolution of the CA in time so that jumping between basins is possible, have\nprovided the necessary backdrop. Given a CA rule to be followed by all cells\nsynchronously, our model is based on a probability with which each cell, at\neach time step, independently updates its own state differently than the rule\nmandates. Setting up and solving the corresponding Markov chain for its\nstationary probabilities have revealed that already in the context of\nelementary CA there exist rules that, while allowing transitions between\nbasins, display remarkable resiliency in terms of basin occupation. For these\nrules, the long-run probability that the CA is found in a given basin is\npractically the same as in the deterministic case when the initial CA state is\nchosen uniformly at random. We argue that, consequently, our single-parameter\nCA model may be a suitable abstraction of immunity as computation.\n",

If, however, in place of simple\ncells one uses agents which change their behaviour from one rule to another\nafter a fixed number of iterations, the classification can be performed by the\ntraffic rule 184 and the majority rule 232. This two-rule solution cannot be\neasily generalized to two (or higher) dimensions, because it critically depends\non a kinetic phase transition occurring in the rule 184. No rule exhibiting\nanalogous transition is known in two dimensions, most likely because no such\nrule exists. We propose, therefore, to approach this problem form a slightly\ndifferent angle, namely by introducing a stochastic component into each of the\ntwo rules. If one precedes each iteration of rule 184 by the stochastic \"lane\nchanging rule,\" and each iteration of rule 232 by the stochastic \"crowd\navoidance\" rule, in the limit of infinitely many iterations the classification\ncan be performed correctly with probability 1.

The normalized information distance has been used previously to\nfind a hierarchical clustering of CA rules.

The reduction of entropy\ndensity during time evolution can be related to energy dissipation through\nLandauer principle.

In addition, the number of reserved sites is found to increase\nwith an S-shape curve as the bias to the rightmost site increases.

In this model, the assault\non pedestrians, the death of pedestrians and the capture of the guard were\ninvolved simultaneously. An alternative evacuation strategy which can largely\nreduce the number of death was developed and effects of several key parameters\nsuch as the deterrence radius and capture distance on evacuation dynamics were\nstudied. Results show that congestion near the exit has dual effects. More\nspecially, the guard could catch all attackers in a short time because the\nattackers would have more concentrated distribution, but more casualties would\nhappen because pedestrians are hard to escape the attack due to congestion. In\ncontrast, when pedestrians have more preference of approaching the guard,\nalthough the guard would take more time to capture the attackers result from\nthe dispersion of attackers, the death toll would decrease. One of the reason\nis the dispersal of the crowd and the decrease in congestion would be\nbeneficial for escape. Another is the attackers would be killed before\nlaunching the attack to the people those are around the guard, in other words,\nthe guard would protect a large number of pedestrians from being killed.\nMoreover, increasing capture distance of the guard can effectively reduce the\ncasualties and the catch time. As the deterrence radius reflecting the tendency\nof escaping from the guard for attackers rises, it would become more difficult\nfor the guard to catch the attackers and more casualties are caused. However,\nwhen the deterrence radius reaches a certain level, the number of deaths would\nbe reduced because the attackers would prefer to stay as far away as possible\nfrom instead of the position where they could attack more people.\n",

It becomes apparent how\ndifficult it is to remain with a deterministic dynamics after coarse graining.\nSeveral examples are shown where an effective stochastic dynamics is obtained\nafter a deterministic dynamics is coarse grained. These results suggest why\nrandom processes are so common in nature.\n",

Vehicles enter the roundabout via on-ramp queues that have\nstochastic arrival processes, remain on the roundabout a random number of\ncells, and depart via off-ramps. Importantly, the model does not oversimplify\nthe dynamics of traffic on roundabouts, while various performance-related\nquantities (such as delay and queue length) allow an analytical\ncharacterization. In particular, we present an explicit expression for the\nmarginal stationary distribution of each cell on the lattice. Moreover, we\nderive results that give insight on the dependencies between parts of the\nroundabout, and on the queue distribution. Finally, we find scaling limits that\nallow, for every partition of the roundabout in segments, to approximate 1) the\njoint distribution of the occupation of these segments by a multivariate\nGaussian distribution; and 2) the joint distribution of their total queue\nlengths by a collection of independent Poisson random variables. To verify the\nscaling limit statements, we develop a novel way to empirically assess\nconvergence in distribution of random variables.\n",

Because of their complexity and\ntheir ability to innovate with respect to their environment, living systems are\nconsidered to be open-ended. Historically, it has been difficult to model\nopen-ended evolution and innovation. As a result, our understanding of the\nexact mechanisms that distinguish open-ended living systems from non-living\nones is limited. One of the biggest barriers is understanding how multiple,\ncomplex parts within a single system interact and contribute to the complex,\nemergent behavior of the system as a whole. How do interactions between parts\nof a system lead to more complex behavior of the system as a whole? This paper\npresents two interacting cellular automata (CA) as an abstract model to address\nthe effects of complex interactions between two individual entities embedded\nwithin a larger system. Unlike elementary CA, each CA changes its update rules\nas a function of the system's state as a whole. The resulting behavior of the\ntwo-CA system suggests that complex interaction functions between the two CA\nhave little to no effect on the complexity of each individual CA behavior and\nstructure. However, having an interaction function that is random results in\nopen-ended evolution regardless of the specific type of state-dependency.\n",

An update rule describes how the type of a vertex is updated given\nthe types of its neighbors. In every round, all vertices are updated\nsynchronously, which leads to a configuration update. While in general, Game of\nLife allows a broad range of update rules, we focus on two simple families of\nupdate rules, namely, underpopulation and overpopulation, that model several\ninteresting dynamics studied in the literature. In both settings, a dead vertex\nrequires at least a desired number of live neighbors to become alive.

This paper presents the current results of\nan ongoing computational study of GOE configurations in Conway's Game of Life\n(GoL) cellular automaton. Specifically, we describe the current status of a map\nof the layout of GOEs and nonGOEs in density/size space, characterize how the\ndensity-dependent structure of the number of precursors varies with increasing\ngrid size as we approach the point where GOEs begin to occur, provide a catalog\nof all known GOE configurations up to a grid size of 11x11, and initiate a\nstudy of the structure of the network of constraints that characterize GOE vs.\nnonGOE configurations.\n",

In this work we\npresent two new types of CNNs that can perform computations with real data, and\nwhose dynamics can be understood almost completely. The first type of networks\nare edge detectors for grayscale images. The stationary states of these\nnetworks are organized hierarchically in a lattice structure. The dynamics of\nany of these networks consists of transitions toward some minimal state in the\nlattice. The second type is a new class of reaction-diffusion networks. We\ninvestigate the stability of these networks and show that they can be used as\nfilters to reduce noise, preserving the edges, in grayscale images polluted\nwith additive Gaussian noise. The networks introduced here were found\nexperimentally. They are abstract evolution equations on spaces of real-valued\nfunctions defined in the p-adic unit ball for some prime number p. In practical\napplications the prime p is determined by the size of image, and thus, only\nsmall primes are used. We provide several numerical simulations showing how\nthese networks work.\n",

Despite their widespread use, it is challenging to fit sLMs\nto data, as their likelihood function is commonly intractable and the models\nnon-differentiable. The adjacent field of agent-based modelling (ABM), faced\nwith similar challenges, has recently introduced an approach to approximate\ngradients in network-controlled ABMs via reparameterization tricks. This\napproach enables efficient gradient-based optimization with automatic\ndifferentiation (AD), which allows for a directed local search of suitable\nparameters rather than estimation via black-box sampling. In this study, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of using similar reparameterization tricks to fit\nsLMs through backpropagation of approximate gradients. We consider four common\nscenarios: fitting to single-state transitions, fitting to trajectories,\ninference of lattice states, and identification of stable lattice\nconfigurations. We demonstrate that all tasks can be solved by AD using four\nexample sLMs from sociology, biophysics, image processing, and physical\nchemistry. Our results show that AD via approximate gradients is a promising\nmethod to fit sLMs to data for a wide variety of models and tasks.\n",

If the process increments follow a probability\ndistribution with tails approaching to zero faster than a power law, the usual\nqualitative behaviours of the standard reaction diffusion system, i.e.,\nexponential tails for the reacting field and a constant front speed, are\nrecovered. On the contrary if the process has power law tails, also the\nreacting field shows power law tail and the front speed increases exponentially\nwith time. The comparison with other reaction-transport systems which exhibit\nanomalous diffusion shows that, not only the presence of anomalous diffusion,\nbut also the detailed mechanism, is relevant for the front propagation.\n",

This is similar in fashion\nto the wave selection in a bottleneck simulation of the optimal-velocity (OV)\nmodel, which is explained by a travelling wave phase-plane analysis of the\ncorresponding continuum model. It is yet another strong indication that CA and\nOV models share certain underlying dynamics, although the former are discrete\nin space and time while the latter are continuous.\n",

The structures discovered include\npropagating quasi-one dimensional patterns, very slowly growing clusters, still\nand oscillatory stationary localizations. Although we hardly find such\nidealized patterns in nature, due to increased complexity of interaction\nphenomena, we recognize our findings as basic spatial patterns of mutualistic\nsystems, which can be used as baseline to build up more complex models.\n",

It is often\npointed out that there is a close relation between the optimal velocity model\nand the mKdV equation, a soliton equation. Meanwhile, the ultra-discrete method\nenables one to reduce soliton equations to cellular automata which inherit the\nsolitonic nature, such as an infinite number of conservation laws, and soliton\nsolutions. We find that the theory of soliton equations is available for\ngeneric differential equations, and the simulation results reveal that the\nmodel obtained reproduces both absolutely unstable and convectively unstable\nflows as well as the optimal velocity model.\n",

Near the threshold value, the PBC occasionally desolve\nitself to recover the free flow. In other words, the time evolution of the size\nof the PBC governs the flux of a counter chemotactic flow.

This paper deals mainly with ACA on infinite commutative\ngroups and direct products of them with some non commutative $p$-groups. It\nappears that for all abelian groups, the rules and initial states with finite\nsupports define behaviors which being restricted to some infinite regular\nseries of time moments become significantly simplified. In particular, for free\nabelian groups with $n$ generators states $V^{[t]}$ of ACA with a rule $R$ at\ntime moments $t=p^k,k>k_0,$ can be viewed as $||R||$ copies of initial state\n$V^{[0]}$ moving through an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. That is the\nbehavior is similar to gliders from J.Conway's automaton {\\sl Life}. For some\nother special infinite series of time moments the automata states approximate\nself-similar structures and the approximation becomes better with time. An\ninfinite class $\\mathrm{DHC}(\\mbf S,\\theta)$ of non-commutative $p$-groups is\ndescribed which in particular includes quaternion and dihedral $p$-groups. It\nis shown that the simplification of behaviors takes place as well for direct\nproducts of non-commutative groups from the class $\\mathrm{DHC}(\\mbf S,\\theta)$\nwith commutative groups. Finally, an automaton on a non-commutative group is\nconstructed such that its behavior at time moments $2^k,k\\ge2,$ is similar to a\nglider gun.

Amongst other intriguing discoveries we\nfound that upper boundary of excitation interval more significantly affects\nmorphological diversity of configurations generated than lower boundary of the\ninterval does and there is no match between functions which produce\nconfigurations of excitation with highest morphological diversity and\nconfigurations of interval boundaries with highest morphological diversity.\nPotential directions of future studies of excitable media with dynamically\nchanging excitability may focus on relations of the automaton model with living\nexcitable media, e.g. neural tissue and muscles, novel materials with\nmemristive properties, and networks of conductive polymers.\n",

In this paper we present a new two-dimensional\nCA model for solid dynamics. In this model the solid body is represented by a\nset of white and black particles alternatively positioned in the $x$- and $y$-\ndirections. The force acting on each particle is represented by the linear\nsummation of relative displacements of the nearest-neighboring particles. The\nkey technique in this new model is the construction of eight coefficient\nmatrices. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that the present model can be\nmathematically described by a conservative system. So, it works for elastic\nmaterial. In the continuum limit the CA model recovers the well-known Navier\nequations. The coefficient matrices are related to the shear module and Poisson\nratio of the material body. Compared with previous CA model for solid body,\nthis model realizes the natural coupling of deformations in the $x$- and $y$-\ndirections. Consequently, the wave phenomena related to the Poisson ratio\neffects are successfully recovered. This work advances significantly the CA\nmodeling and simulation in the field of computational solid dynamics.\n",

We then demonstrate that for a\nshift-invariant probability measure, probabilities of all blocks of length up\nto $k$ can be expressed by $(N-1)N^{k-1}$ linearly independent block\nprobabilities. Two choices of these independent blocks are discussed in detail,\none in which we choose the longest possible blocks (\"long form\") and one in\nwhich we choose the shortest possible blocks (\"short form\"). We then proceed to\nreview the method which allows to approximate probabilities of blocks longer\nthan $k$ by blocks of length $k$ or less. This approximation, known as Bayesian\nextension or Markov measure, is then used to construct approximate orbits of\nshift-invariant probability measures under the action of probabilistic or\ndeterministic cellular automaton. We show that the aforementioned approximate\norbit is completely determined by an $(N-1)N^{k-1}$-dimensional map. When the\nshort form of block probabilities is used, this map takes particularly simple\nform, often revealing important features of a particular cellular automaton.\n",

        "summary": "  A novel Lattice Boltzmann Method applicable to compressible fluid flows is\ndeveloped. This method is based on replacing the governing equations by a\nrelaxation system and the interpretation of the diagonal form of the relaxation\nsystem as a discrete velocity Boltzmann system. As a result of this\ninterpretation, the local equilibrium distribution functions are simple\nalgebraic functions of the conserved variables and the fluxes, without the low\nMach number expansion present in the equilibrium distribution of the\ntraditional Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). This new Lattice Boltzmann\nRelaxation Scheme (LBRS) thus overcomes the low Mach number limitation and can\nsuccessfully simulate compressible flows. While doing so, our algorithm retains\nall the distinctive features of the traditional LBM. Numerical simulations\ncarried out for inviscid flows in one and two dimensions show that the method\ncan simulate the features of compressible flows like shock waves and expansion\nwaves.\n",

For so-called synthetic\nlanguages, such as Latin or Polish, they have particularly interesting\nstructure due to abundance of inflectional forms. We construct the simplest\nform of inflection graphs, namely a bipartite graph in which one group of\nvertices corresponds to dictionary headwords and the other group to inflected\nforms encountered in a given text. We then study projection of this graph on\nthe set of headwords. The projection decomposes into a large number of\nconnected components, to be called word groups. Distribution of sizes of word\ngroup exhibits some remarkable properties, resembling cluster distribution in a\nlattice percolation near the critical point. We propose a simple model which\nproduces graphs of this type, reproducing the desired component distribution\nand other topological features.\n",

In contrast with the original BML model on a square lattice,\nthe same model on a honeycomb does not show any anisotropy or intermediate\nstates, but a single continuous phase transition between free and totally\ncongested flow, a transition that can be completely characterized by the tools\nof classical percolation. Although the transition occurs at a lower density\nthan for the conventional BML, simple modifications, like randomly stopping the\ncars with a very small probability or increasing the traffic light periods,\ndrives the model to perform better on honeycomb lattices. As traffic lights and\ndisordered perturbations are inherent to real traffic, these results question\nthe actual role of the square grid-like designs and suggests the honeycombs as\nan interesting alternative for urban planning in real cities.\n",

Both the critical threshold parameter $p_{c}$ and the critical\nexponents are estimated with good precision. In order to investigate the\nincrease of statistical fluctuations and the onset of chaos in the critical\nregion of the model, we have also defined a magnetic entropy to these systems.\nIt is seen that the magnetic entropy behaves in a different way when one passes\nfrom the frozen regime ($p<p_{c}$) to the chaotic regime ($p>p_{c}$). For a\nfurther analysis, the robustness of the propagation of failures is checked by\nintroducing a quenched site dilution probability $q$ on the lattices. It is\nseen that the damage spreading is quite sensitive when a small fraction of the\nlattice sites are disconnected. A finite-size scaling analysis is employed to\nestimate the critical exponents. From these numerical estimates, we claim that\non both pure ($q=0$) and diluted ($q=0.05$) quasiperiodic lattices, the KCA\nmodel belongs to the same universality class than on square lattices.\nFurthermore, with the aim of comparing the dynamical behavior between periodic\nand quasiperiodic systems, the propagation speed of the damage is also\ncalculated for the square lattice assuming the same conditions.

On the level of\nbiological tissues, patterns form due to interactions between cells. These\ninteractions can be long-range if mediated by diffusive molecules or\nshort-range when associated with cell-to-cell contact sites. Mathematical\nstudies of long-range interactions in-volve models based on differential\nequations while short-range interactions are modelled using discrete type\nmodels. In this paper, we use cellular automata (CA) technique to study\nformation of patterns due to short-range interactions. Namely, we use von\nNeumann cellular automata represented by a finite set of lattices whose states\nevolve according to transition rules. Lattices can be considered as\nrepresenting biological cells (which, in the simplest case, can only be in one\nof the two different states) while the transition rules define changes in their\nstates due to the cell-to-cell contact interactions. In this model, we identify\nrules result-ing in the formation of stationary periodic patterns. In our\nanalysis, we distin-guish rules which do not destroy preset patterns and those\nwhich cause pattern formation from random initial conditions. Also, we check\nwhether the forming patterns are resistant to noise and analyze the time frame\nfor their formation. Transition rules which allow formation of stationary\nperiodic patterns are then discussed in terms of pattern formation in biology.\n",

However, training was never completely successful for $t>1$, and even\nwhen successful, a reconstruction of the elementary rule ($t=1$) from $t>1$\ndata is not within the scope of what the neural network can deliver. We\ndescribe an alternative network-like method, based on constraint projections,\nwhere this is possible. From a single data item this method perfectly\nreconstructs not just the automaton rule but also the states in the time steps\nit did not see. For a unique reconstruction, the size of the initial state need\nonly be large enough that it and the $t-1$ states it evolves into contain all\npossible automaton input patterns. We demonstrate the method on 1D binary\ncellular automata that take inputs from $n$ adjacent cells. The unknown rules\nin our experiments are not restricted to simple rules derived from a few linear\nfunctions on the inputs (as in Game of Life), but include all $2^{2^n}$\npossible rules on $n$ inputs. Our results extend to $n=6$, for which exhaustive\nrule-search is not feasible.

Using a multi-state stochastic hotchpotch model, we show\nhere that the mesoscopic behaviour of the non-stirred B--Z reaction is both\nqualitatively and quantitatively susceptible to the description in terms of\nstochastic multilevel cellular automata. This further implies that the\nmesoscopic dynamics of the non-stirred B--Z reaction results from a delicate\ninterplay between a) a maximal number of available states within the elementary\ntime lag (i.e. a minimal time interval needed for demise of a final state) and\nb) an imprecision or uncertainty in the definition of state.

Each passer-by moves to his selected location according\nto the Fermi function, and the average velocity of pedestrian flow is defined\nas a function of the motion rule. Two pedestrian types are included:\ncooperators, who adhere to the evacuation instructions; and defectors, who\nignore the rules and act individually. It is observed that the escape time\nincreases with the panic level, and the system remains smooth for a low panic\nlevel, but exhibits three stages for a high panic level. We prove that the\npanic level determines the dynamics of this system, and the initial density of\ncooperators has a negligible impact. The system experiences three phases, a\nsingle phase of cooperator, a mixed two-phase pedestrian, and a single phase of\ndefector sequentially as the panic level upgrades. The phase transition has\nbeen proven basically robust to the changes of empty site contribution, wall's\npressure, and noise amplitude in the motion rule.

Frequently, this type of automata has been found through\neither an exhaustive search or a meticulous construction of the evolution rule.\nIn this study, the specification of cellular automata with complex behaviors\nwas obtained by utilizing randomly generated specimens. In particular, it\nproposed that a cellular automaton of $n$ states should be specified at random\nand then extended to another automaton with a higher number of states so that\nthe original automaton operates as a periodic background where the additional\nstates serve to define the gliders. Moreover, this study presented an\nexplanation of this method. Furthermore, the random way of defining complex\ncellular automata was studied by using mean-field approximations for various\nstates and local entropy measures. This specification was refined with a\ngenetic algorithm to obtain specimens with a higher degree of complexity. With\nthis methodology, it was possible to generate complex automata with hundreds of\nstates, demonstrating that randomly defined local interactions with multiple\nstates can construct complexity.\n",

The work also explores the\ncomputational ability of such cellular automaton that illustrates the\ncomputability of solving the affinity classification problem. In addition to\nthat, a cellular automaton, defined over Cayley tree, is shown as the classical\nsearching problem solver. The proposed temporally stochastic cellular automata\ndeals with two elementary cellular automata rules, say $f$ and $g$. The $f$ is\nthe default rule, however, $g$ is temporally applied to the overall system with\nsome probability $\\tau$ which acts as a noise in the system. After exploring\nthe dynamics of temporally stochastic cellular automata (TSCAs), we study the\ndynamical behavior of these temporally stochastic cellular automata (TSCAs) to\nidentify the TSCAs that converge to a fixed point from any seed. We apply each\nof the convergent TSCAs to some standard datasets and observe the effectiveness\nof each TSCA as a pattern classifier. It is observed that the proposed\nTSCA-based classifier shows competitive performance in comparison with existing\nclassifier algorithms. We use temporally stochastic cellular automata to solve\na new problem in the field of cellular automata, named as, affinity\nclassification problem which is a generalization of the density classification\nproblem . We show that this model can be used in several applications, like\nmodeling self-healing systems.

Each cell of the computing unit\nacts as a tiny processing element with attached memory.

It then presents the concept of LCA, where layer 0 corresponds to a\npredefined model, and layer 1 represents the proposed model with additional\ninfluence. The interlayer rules, denoted as f and g, enable interactions not\nonly from adjacent neighboring cells but also from some far-away neighboring\ncells, capturing long-range dependencies. The thesis explores various LCA\nmodels, including those based on averaging, maximization, minimization, and\nmodified ECA neighborhoods. Additionally, the implementation of LCA on the 2-D\ncellular automaton Game of Life is discussed, showcasing intriguing patterns\nand behaviors. Through extensive experiments, the dynamics of different LCA\nmodels are analyzed, revealing their sensitivity to rule changes and block size\nvariations. Convergent LCAs, which converge to fixed points from any initial\nconfiguration, are identified and used to design a two-class pattern\nclassifier. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the competitive performance of\nthe LCA-based classifier against existing algorithms.

Here we present two new approaches to automatically filter the\nchanging configurations of spatial dynamical systems and extract coherent\nstructures. One, local sensitivity filtering, is a modification of the local\nLyapunov exponent approach suitable to cellular automata and other discrete\nspatial systems. The other, local statistical complexity filtering, calculates\nthe amount of information needed for optimal prediction of the system's\nbehavior in the vicinity of a given point. By examining the changing\nspatiotemporal distributions of these quantities, we can find the coherent\nstructures in a variety of pattern-forming cellular automata, without needing\nto guess or postulate the form of that structure. We apply both filters to\nelementary and cyclical cellular automata (ECA and CCA) and find that they\nreadily identify particles, domains and other more complicated structures. We\ncompare the results from ECA with earlier ones based upon the theory of formal\nlanguages, and the results from CCA with a more traditional approach based on\nan order parameter and free energy. While sensitivity and statistical\ncomplexity are equally adept at uncovering structure, they are based on\ndifferent system properties (dynamical and probabilistic, respectively), and\nprovide complementary information.\n",

Using\nnearest neighbor, one-dimensional Cellular Automata (CA) as an example, we show\nhow to construct local coarse-grained descriptions of CA in all classes of\nWolfram's classification. The resulting coarse-grained CA that we construct are\ncapable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without\naccounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by\nthis construction are known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate\nany CA or other computing devices and are therefore undecidable. We thus show\nthat because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained information, complex\nphysical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of\ndescription. The renormalization group flows that we construct induce a\nhierarchy of CA rules. This hierarchy agrees well with apparent rule complexity\nand is therefore a good candidate for a complexity measure and a classification\nmethod. Finally we argue that the large scale dynamics of CA can be very\nsimple, at least when measured by the Kolmogorov complexity of the large scale\nupdate rule, and moreover exhibits a novel scaling law. We show that because of\nthis large-scale simplicity, the probability of finding a coarse-grained\ndescription of CA approaches unity as one goes to increasingly coarser scales.\nWe interpret this large scale simplicity as a pattern formation mechanism in\nwhich large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the simplicity of the\nrules that govern the large scale dynamics.\n",

A prevalent assumption which often\nguarantees recovery from the given measurements is that $x$ lies in a known\nsubspace. Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured\nsignal models, in which $x$ lies in a union of subspaces. In this paper we\ndevelop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals\nfrom a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which $x$\nlies in a sum of $k$ subspaces, chosen from a larger set of $m$ possibilities.\nThe samples are modelled as inner products with an arbitrary set of sampling\nfunctions. To derive an efficient and robust recovery algorithm, we show that\nour problem can be formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector whose\nnon-zero elements appear in fixed blocks. We then propose a mixed\n$\\ell_2/\\ell_1$ program for block sparse recovery. Our main result is an\nequivalence condition under which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed\nto recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of block\nrestricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard\nRIP used extensively in the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP we also\nprove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modelling errors.\n  A special case of our framework is that of recovering multiple measurement\nvectors (MMV) that share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to this\ncontext leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as equivalence conditions\nunder which the entire set can be determined efficiently.\n",

The analogy between what happens in some automata (in particular\nConway's <<Game of Life>>) and the real world is very strong.

A cellular automata\nsimulation of these processes both generates and maintains mound-pool\ntopography with minimal dependence on initial conditions, and can also describe\nmound morphogenesis on slopes, where observed mound geometry is distinct from\nthat on level ground.\n",

In particular, we simulate realistic signal systems that\ninclude signal linking and adaptive cycle times, and compare their performance\nagainst a highly adaptive system of self-organizing traffic signals which is\ndesigned to uniformly distribute the network density. We find that for networks\nwith time-independent boundary conditions, well-defined stationary MFDs are\nobserved, whose shape depends on the particular signal system used, and also on\nthe level of heterogeneity in the system. We find that the spatial\nheterogeneity of both density and flow provide important indicators of network\nperformance. We also study networks with time-dependent boundary conditions,\ncontaining morning and afternoon peaks. In this case, intricate hysteresis\nloops are observed in the MFDs which are strongly correlated with the density\nheterogeneity. Our results show that the MFD of the self-organizing traffic\nsignals lies above the MFD for the realistic systems, suggesting that by\nadaptively homogenizing the network density, overall better performance and\nhigher capacity can be achieved.\n",

However, these\ndynamic computation systems possess evolutionary rules dependent on a\nneighborhood of adjacent cells, which limits their sampling radius and the\nenvironments that they can be used in.\n  The purpose of this study was to explore the complex nature of\none-dimensional CA in configurations other than that of the standard ECA.\nNamely, \"long-distance cellular automata\" (LDCA), a construct that had been\ndescribed in the past, but never studied. I experimented with a class of LDCA\nthat used spaced sample cells unlike ECA, and were described by the notation\nLDCA-x-y-n, where x and y represented the amount of spacing between the cell\nand its left and right neighbors, and n denoted the length of the initial tape\nfor tapes of finite size. Some basic characteristics of ECA are explored in\nthis paper, such as seemingly universal behavior, the prevalence of complexity\nwith varying neighborhoods, and qualitative behavior as a function of x and y\nspacing.\n  Focusing mainly on purely Class 4 behavior in LDCA-1-2, I found that Rule 73\ncould potentially be Turing universal through the emulation of a cyclic tag\nsystem, and revealed a connection between the mathematics of binary trees and\nEulerian numbers that might provide insight into unsolved problems in both\nfields.\n",

In\nparticular the game nicely illustrates that cyclic interactions allow multiple\nstrategies to coexist for long time intervals. When formulated in terms of a\none-dimensional cellular automata, the spatial distribution of strategies\nexhibits coarsening with algebraically growing domain size over time, while the\ntwo-dimensional version allows domains to break and thereby opens for long-time\ncoexistence. We here consider a quasi-one-dimensional implementation of the\ncyclic competition, and study the long-term dynamics as a function of rare\ninvasions between parallel linear ecosystems. We find that increasing the\ncomplexity from two to three parallel subsystems allows a transition from\ncomplete coarsening to an active steady state where the domain size stays\nfinite. We further find that this transition happens irrespective of whether\nthe update is done in parallel for all sites simultaneously, or done randomly\nin sequential order. In both cases the active state is characterized by\nlocalized bursts of dislocations, followed by longer periods of coarsening. In\nthe case of the parallel dynamics, we find that there is another phase\ntransition between the active steady state and the coarsening state within the\nthree-line system when the invasion rate between the subsystems is varied. We\nidentify the critical parameter for this transition, and show that the density\nof active boundaries have critical exponents that are consistent with the\ndirected percolation universality class. On the other hand, numerical\nsimulations with the random sequential dynamics suggest that the system may\nexhibit an active steady state as long as the invasion rate is finite.\n",

Recently, the system\nwas determined to show a self-deflection effect, in which the site usage\ndistribution biases spontaneously toward the leftmost site, and the throughput\nbecomes maximum when the site usage distribution is slightly biased to the\nrightmost site, instead of being an exact uniform distribution. Our exact\nanalysis describes this deflection effect and show a good agreement with\nsimulations.\n",

We explore this problem in the context of cellular automata\n(CA), simple dynamical systems that are intrinsically discrete and thus\ndifficult to analyze using standard tools from dynamical systems theory. We\nshow that any CA may readily be represented using a convolutional neural\nnetwork with a network-in-network architecture.

In the limit of large network widths, we find that training\ndynamics are nearly identical across replicates, and that common patterns\nemerge in the structure of networks trained on different CA rulesets. We train\nensembles of networks on randomly-sampled CA, and we probe how the trained\nnetworks internally represent the CA rules using an information-theoretic\ntechnique based on distributions of layer activation patterns. We find that CA\nwith simpler rule tables produce trained networks with hierarchical structure\nand layer specialization, while more complex CA produce shallower\nrepresentations---illustrating how the underlying complexity of the CA's rules\ninfluences the specificity of these internal representations.

The\nproposed 1D cellular automata (CA) models with the Arrhenius type look-ahead\ninteractions implement stochastic rules for cars' movement following the\nconfiguration of the traffic ahead of each car. In particular, we take two\ndifferent look-ahead rules: one is based on the distance from the car under\nconsideration to the car in front of it; the other one depends on the car\ndensity ahead. Both rules feature a novel idea of multiple moves, which plays a\nkey role in recovering the non-concave flux in the macroscopic dynamics.\nThrough a semi-discrete mesoscopic stochastic process, we derive the\ncoarse-grained macroscopic dynamics of the CA model. We also design a numerical\nscheme to simulate the proposed CA models with an efficient list-based kinetic\nMonte Carlo (KMC) algorithm.

This paper delves\ninto this relationship through an examination of a recently developed CA known\nas Lenia. We demonstrate that asymptotic Lenia, a variant of Lenia, can be\ncomprehensively described by differential equations, and, unlike the original\nLenia, it is independent of time-step ticks. Further, we establish that this\nformulation is mathematically equivalent to a generalization of the\nkernel-based Turing model (KT model). Stemming from these insights, we\nestablish that asymptotic Lenia can be replicated by an RD system composed\nsolely of diffusion and spatially local reaction terms, resulting in the\nsimulated asymptotic Lenia based on an RD system, or \"RD Lenia\". However, our\nRD Lenia cannot be construed as a chemical system since the reaction term fails\nto satisfy mass-action kinetics.\n",

Lower-level, shapeshifting\nclusters frequently follow a transient attractor trajectory, generating new\nclusters, some of which periodically self-duplicate. When the initial\ndistribution of live cells is sufficiently sparse, these clusters coalesce into\nlarger formations that also self-replicate. These formations may further form\nthe boundaries of an expanding complex on an even larger scale. This rule,\ndubbed ``Outlier,'' is rotationally symmetric and applies to 2D Moore\nneighborhoods. It was evolved through Genetic Programming during an extensive\nautomated search for rules that foster open-ended evolution in CA. While\nself-replicating structures, both crafted and emergent, have been created in CA\nwith state sets intentionally designed for this purpose, the Outlier may be the\nfirst known rule to facilitate emergent self-replication across two spatial\nscales in simple binary CA.\n",

To reduce congestion,\nreal-time traffic control by short-term forecast is necessary. For achieving\nthis, data assimilation using a stochastic CA model and DFOS is promising. Data\nassimilation with a CA enables us to model real-time traffic flow with simple\nprocesses even when rare or sudden events occur, which is challenging for usual\nmachine learning-based methods. DFOS overcomes issues of conventional point\nsensors that have dead zones of observation. By estimating optimal model\nparameters that reproduce observed traffic flow in the simulation, future\ntraffic flow is forecasted from the simulation. We propose an optimal model\nparameter estimation method using mean velocity as an extracted feature and the\nparticle filter. In addition, an estimation methodology for the microscopic\ntraffic situation is developed to set the initial condition of simulation for\nforecast in accordance with observation. The proposed methods are verified by\nsimulation-based traffic flow. The simulation adopts the stochastic\nNishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model. The optimal model parameters are\nsuccessfully derived from posterior probability distributions (PPDs) estimated\nfrom DFOS data. In contrast, those estimated from point sensors fail. The PPDs\nof model parameters also indicate that each parameter has different\nsensitivities to traffic flow. A traffic forecast up to 60 minutes later is\ncarried out. Using optimal model parameters estimated from DFOS, the forecast\nerror of mean velocity is approximately $\\pm$10 km/h (percentage error is 18%).\nThe error attains half of it when conventional point sensors are used.

To\nunderstand the collective dynamics of the cells, we devise an appropriate\ncontinuum limit in which the number of cells and the length of the substrate\nare constant but the number of springs tends to infinity. In this limit, cell\ndensity is governed by a diffusion equation in arc length coordinates, where\ndiffusion may be linear or nonlinear depending on the choice of the spring\nrestoring force law. Our results have important implications about modelling\ncells on curved geometries: (i) curved and straight springs can lead to\ndifferent dynamics when there is a finite number of springs, but they both\nconverge quadratically to the dynamics governed by the diffusion equation; (ii)\nin the continuum limit, the curvature of the tissue does not affect the\nmechanical relaxation of cells within the layer nor their tangential stress;\n(iii) a cell's normal stress depends on curvature due to surface tension\ninduced by the tangential forces.

        "summary": "  Some deterministic cellular automata have been observed to follow the pattern\nof the second law of thermodynamics: starting from a partially disordered\nstate, the system evolves towards a state of equilibrium characterized by\nmaximal disorder. This chapter is an exposition of this phenomenon and of a\nstatistical scheme for its explanation. The formulation is in the same vein as\nBoltzmann's ideas, but the simple combinatorial setup offers clarification and\nhope for generic mathematically rigorous results. Probabilities represent\nfrequencies and subjective interpretations are avoided.\n",

Although these tilings are\nnonperiodic, determining the next state of each tile is a local computation,\nrequiring only knowledge of the local structure of the tiling and the states of\nfinitely many nearby tiles. As an example, we show a version of a \"glider\"\nmoving through a region of a Penrose tiling. This constitutes a potential\ntheoretical framework for a method of executing computations in\nnon-periodically structured substrates such as quasicrystals.\n",

Respective set of equations describing\nstationary state of the FRDA is derived and compared with infinite case. It is\nshown that for the system of big size, these equations are coincident with RDA\nequations. We demonstrate a non-existence of exact equations for size N bigger\nthen 4 and propose appropriate approximations, the quality of which is studied\nin examples obtained within Markov chains framework.\n  We derive several exact formulas describing properties of the automaton,\nincluding time aspects. In particular, a way to achieve a quasi-periodic like\nbehaviour of RDA is presented. Thus, based on the same microscopic rule - which\nproduces exponential and inverse-power like distributions - we extend\napplicability of the model to quasi-periodic phenomena.\n",
