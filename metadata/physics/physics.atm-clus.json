In principle there are many\nformulations of the TDLDA, but we have found that a particularly efficient\nmethod for large clusters is to use a coordinate space mesh and the algorithms\nfor the operators and the evolution equations that had been developed for the\nnuclear time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. The TDLDA works remarkably well to\ndescribe the strong excitations in alkali metal clusters and in carbon\nclusters. We show as an example the benzene molecule, which has two strong\nfeatures in its spectrum. The systematics of the linear carbon chains is well\nreproduced, and may be understood in rather simple terms.\n",

Na_142, whose atoms are distributed in two (surface and\ninner) main shells with different radial distances to the center of mass of the\ncluster, melts in two steps: the first one, at approx. 130 K, is characterized\nby a high intrashell mobility of the atoms, and the second, homogeneous\nmelting, at approx. 270 K, involves diffusive motion of all the atoms across\nthe whole cluster volume (both intrashell and intershell displacements are\nallowed). On the contrary, the melting of Na_92 proceeds gradually over a very\nwide temperature interval, without any abrupt step visible in the thermal or\nstructural melting indicators. The occurrence of well defined steps in the\nmelting transition is then shown to be related to the existence of a\ndistribution of the atoms in shells. Thereby we propose a necessary condition\nfor a cluster to be considered rigorously amorphouslike (totally disordered),\nnamely that there are no space regions of the cluster where the local value of\nthe atomic density is considerably reduced. Na_92 is the only cluster from the\ntwo considered that verifies this condition, so its thermal behavior can be\nconsidered as representative of that expected for amorphous clusters.

The formation of\nthe hcp phase with increasing cluster size is reliably detected for the first\ntime. Observations are made for mean cluster sizes N in the range from 1x10^3\nto 8x10^4 atoms/cluster. An analysis of the shape of the diffraction peaks is\ncarried out. It is found that in the range N <= 2x10^3 atoms/cluster, where the\nclusters are icosahedral, the profiles of the diffraction peaks are well\napproximated by a Lorentzian. For fcc clusters with N >= 3x10^3 atoms/cluster a\nbetter approximation is the standard Gaussian function. In the case N >= 1x10^4\natoms/cluster one observes peaks of the hcp phase in addition to the fcc peaks.\nThe intensity of the hcp peaks increases with increasing cluster size, and for\nN = 8x10^4 atoms/cluster, the (110), (101), (103), and (202) peaks,\ncharacteristic only for the hcp phase, are clearly registered in addition to\nthe fcc peaks.

Therefore, it may be more appropriate for a wide range of the\nsize of the clusters. This is important since almost all properties of the\nsmall clusters are size dependent. The results show that the global minima of\nthe Al, Au and Pt clusters have structures based on either octahedral,\ndecahedral, icosahedral or a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral packing.

The aim of the present\nwork is to get analytical expressions describing the nonlinear dynamical\nproperties of the oscillator in noncontact and intermittent contact situations\nin the tapping mode. Three situations are investigated: the pure attractive\ninteraction, the pure repulsive interaction, and a mixing of the two. The\nanalytical solutions obtained allow general trends to be extracted: the\nnoncontact and the intermittent contact show a very discriminate variation of\nthe phase. Therefore the measurement of the phase becomes a simple way to\nidentify whether or not the tip touches the surface during the oscillating\nperiod. It is also found that the key parameter governing the structure of the\ndynamical properties is the product of the quality factor by a reduced\nstiffness. In the attractive regime, the reduced stiffness is the ratio of an\nattractive effective stiffness and the cantilever one. In the repulsive regime,\nthe reduced stiffness is the ratio between the contact stiffness and the\ncantilever one. The quality factor plays an important role. For large values of\nthe quality factor; it is predicted that a pure topography can be obtained\nwhatever the value of the contact stiffness. For a smaller quality factor, the\noscillator becomes more sensitive to change of the local mechanical properties.\nAs a direct consequence, varying the quality factor, for example with a vacuum\nchamber, would be a very interesting way to investigate soft materials either\nto access topographic information or nanomechanical properties.\n",

The variation of the oscillating amplitude of the\ncantilever is interpreted as the result of the growth process of a\nnanoprotuberance. The growth rate is found to be dependent of the magnitude of\nthe oscillating amplitude and of the molecular weight. A model is developed\ndescribing in a very simple way the action of the tip and a viscoelastic\nresponse of the polymer. The numerical simulation helps in understanding the\nnonlinear relation between the growth rate and the vibrating amplitude of the\nmicrolever and describes qualitatively most of the experimental features. For\nthe softer material, experimental situations are found that allow the\nexperimental results to be amenable with an analytical solution. The analytical\nsolution provides a fruitful comparison with the experimental results showing\nthat some of the nanoprotuberance evolution cannot be explained with the\napproximation used.

Recent calculations identify n = 9 as\ncorresponding to the first closed H2 shell [e.g. Stich et al., J. Chem. Phys.\n107, 9482 (1997)]. Recurrence of the distinct characteristics observed in the\ndissociation cross section dependence upon cluster size around n = 9 provides\nthe basis for the presently proposed subsequent closed shells at n = 15, 21,\n27, and 33, in agreement with the calculations of Nagashima et al.

One is to consider a cluster as a collection of many atoms and\nevaluate the sum of two-body and three-body interatomic interactions, a common\nassumption. The other method, valid at large separation, is to consider each\ncluster as a point particle, characterized by a polarizability tensor, and\nevaluate the inter-cluster interaction. This method employs the static\npolarizability, evaluated by including all many-body (MB) intra-cluster atomic\ninteractions self-consistently, which yields the full inter-cluster\ninteraction, including all MB terms. A comparison of the results from the two\nmethods reveals that the contribution of the higher-than-three-body MB\ninteractions is always attractive and non-negligible, with a relative\nimportance that varies with geometry. The procedure is quite general and is\napplicable to any shape or size of dielectric clusters, in principle. We\npresent numerical results for clusters composed of atoms with polarizability\nconsistent with silica, for which the higher-than-three-body MB correction term\ncan be as high as 42% of the atomic pair-wise sum. The full result is quite\nsensitive to the anisotropic structure of the cluster, in contrast to the\nresult found in the additive case, which is orientation independent.

The implementation mimics the electronics\nof a real setup including a digital phase-locked loop (PLL). The PLL is not\nonly used as a very sensitive frequency detector, but also to generate the\ntime-dependent phase shifted signal driving the cantilever. The optimum\nadjustments of individual functional blocks and their joint performance in\ntypical experiments are determined in detail. Prior to testing the complete\nsetup, the performances of the numerical PLL and of the amplitude controller\nwere ascertained to be satisfactory compared to those of the real components.\nAttention is also focused on the issue of apparent dissipation, that is, of\nspurious variations in the driving amplitude caused by the nonlinear\ninteraction occurring between the tip and the surface and by the finite\nresponse times of the various controllers. To do so, an estimate of the minimum\ndissipated energy that is detectable by the instrument upon operating\nconditions is given. This allows us to discuss the relevance of apparent\ndissipation that can be conditionally generated with the simulator in\ncomparison to values reported experimentally. The analysis emphasizes that\napparent dissipation can contribute to the measured dissipation up to 15% of\nthe intrinsic dissipated energy of the cantilever interacting with the surface,\nbut can be made negligible when properly adjusting the controllers, the PLL\ngains and the scan speed. It is inferred that the experimental values of\ndissipation usually reported in the literature cannot only originate in\napparent dissipation, which favors the hypothesis of \"physical\" channels of\ndissipation.\n",

Experiments performed include the decay of a core hole, the\ntime-resolved measurement of photo ionization and electron tunneling. The\nprocesses investigated share the coherent character of the dynamics involving\nvery few, ideally one active electron. Here, we introduce a scheme to probe\ndissipative multi-electron motion in time. In this context attosecond probing\nenables one to obtain information which is lost at later times and cannot be\nretrieved by conventional methods in the energy domain due to the incoherent\nnature of the dynamics. As a specific example we will discuss the charging of a\nrare-gas cluster during a strong femtosecond pulse with attosecond pulses. The\nexample illustrates the proposed use of attosecond pulses and suggests an\nexperimental resolution of a controversy about the mechanism of energy\nabsorption by rare-gas clusters in strong vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) pulses.\n",

The numerical results directly given by the formula coincide\nqualitatively well with existing experimental data, and also with other\ntheoretical results from solving dynamic differential equations.

The height of this barrier is important for\ntechnological applications, as it determines, e.g., the stability of\ninformation stored in magnetic memory devices. It can be estimated by means of\nrelativistic density functional calculations. Our approach is based on a\nfull-potential local-orbital method (FPLO) in a four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham\nimplementation. Orbital polarization corrections to the local density\napproximation are employed. They are discussed in the broader context of\norbital dependent density functionals.

Kr clusters comprising up\nto 70 atoms do not exhibit bulk absorption bands. We suggest that this is due\nto the penetration of the interface excitons into the Kr_m cluster volume,\nbecause of the negative electron affinity of surrounding Ne atoms. From the\nenergy shift of the interface absorption bands with cluster size an\nunexpectedly large penetration depth of delta_1i =7.0+/-0.1 A is estimated,\nwhich can be explained by the interplay between the electron affinities of the\nguest and the host cluster.\n",

Such transition may occur within laser-created plasmas, when the\ninitially created plasma is cold but the heating of the plasma by the laser\nfield is efficient. In particular, such a transition may occur within plasmas\ncreated by intense VUV radiation from a FEL as indicated by the results of the\nfirst experiments performed at the FLASH facility at DESY.\n  In order to estimate the inverse bremsstrahlung cross sections, we use\npoint-like and effective atomic potentials. For ions modelled as point-like\ncharges, the total cross sections are strongly affected by the changing plasma\nenvironment. The maximal change of the cross sections may be of the order of 60\nat the change of the plasma parameters (inverse Debye length, kappa, and the\nelectron density, rho_e), in the range: kappa=0-3 A^{-1} and \\rho_e=0.01-1\nA^{-1}. These ranges correspond to the physical conditions within the plasmas\ncreated during the first cluster experiments performed at the FLASH facility at\nDESY. In contrast, for the effective atomic potentials the total cross sections\nfor photoemission and photoabsorption change only by a factor of 7 at most at\nthe same plasma parameter range.\n  Our results show that the inverse bremsstrahlung cross section estimated with\nthe effective atomic potentials is not much affected by the plasma environment.\nThis observation validates the previous estimations of the enhanced heating\neffect.

The effectiveness\nof this process is determined by the 6D volume in phase space from which\nmolecules are accepted by the Stark decelerator. Couplings between the\nlongitudinal and transverse motion of the molecules in the decelerator can\nreduce this acceptance. These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator\noperates such that only every third electric field stage is used for\ndeceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate\nstages. For many applications, the acceptance of a Stark decelerator in this\nso-called $s=3$ mode significantly exceeds that of a decelerator in the\nconventionally used ($s=1$) mode. This has been experimentally verified by\npassing a beam of OH radicals through a 2.6 meter long Stark decelerator. The\nexperiments are in quantitative agreement with the results of trajectory\ncalculations, and can qualitatively be explained with a simple model for the 6D\nacceptance. These results imply that the 6D acceptance of a Stark decelerator\nin the $s=3$ mode of operation approaches the optimum value, i.e. the value\nthat is obtained when any couplings are neglected.\n",

This review provides an overview of key phenomena\narising from laser-cluster interactions with focus on nonlinear optical\nexcitations and discusses the underlying processes according to the current\nunderstanding.

The\nimplications for technical developments include the controlled generation of\nion, electron, and radiation pulses, as will be addressed along with\ncorresponding examples.

Initial attempts to explain these\nobservations within single particle approximations fail completely. In this\nLetter we present a consistent many-body theory for the description of angular\nresolved photoelectron spectra of metal clusters. Jellium model formalism is\nemployed.

The cross section is shown\nto be strongly oscillatory when the laser polarization direction is parallel to\nthe axis of the system; the oscillation amplitude decreases and vanishes as the\nangle between the laser polarization and the anion axis increases and becomes\nperpendicular to the axis. The average cross section over the orientations of\nthe triatomic system is also obtained. The cross section of the triatomic anion\nis compared with the cross section of a two-center system.

The experiments\nwere also performed in powder adamantane at 301 K which is used as a reference\ncompound having only one dipolar quasiinvariant. We show that the evolution of\nthe quantum states during the build up of the quasi-equilibrium state in 5CB\nprepared under the S condition is similar to the case of adamantane and that\ntheir quasi-equilibrium density operators have the same tensor structure. In\ncontrast, the second constant of motion, whose explicit operator form is not\nknown, involves a richer composition of multiple quantum coherences on the X\nbasis of even order, in consistency with the truncation inherent in its\ndefinition. We exploited the exclusive presence coherences 4, 6, 8, besides 0\nand 2 under the W condition to measure the spin-lattice relaxation time T_{W}\naccurately, so avoiding experimental difficulties that usually impair dipolar\norder relaxation measurement such as Zeeman contamination at high fields, and\nalso superposition of the different quasiinvariants. This procedure opens the\npossibility of measuring the spin-lattice relaxation of a quasiinvariant\nindependent of the Zeeman and S reservoirs, so incorporating a new relaxation\nparameter useful for studying the complex molecular dynamics in mesophases. In\nfact, we report the first measurement of T_{W} in a liquid crystal at high\nmagnetic fields. The comparison of the obtained value with the one\ncorresponding to a lower field (16 MHz) points out that the relaxation of the\nW-order strongly depends on the intensity of the external magnetic field,\nsimilarly to the case of the S reservoir, indicating that the relaxation of the\nW-quasiinvariant is also governed by the cooperative molecular motions.\n",

The kinetic energy\ndistributions of the two fragments have been recorded as a function of the\npump-probe delay, and as a function of excitation within the umbrella and\nstretching vibrational modes of the CH3 fragment. These observations are made\nby using (2+1) Resonant Enhanced MultiPhoton Ionization (REMPI) via the 3pz\n2A2\" state of CH3 to detect specific vibrational levels of CH3. The vibrational\nbranching fractions of the CH3 are recovered by using the individual\nvibrationally state-selected CH3 distributions to fit the kinetic energy\ndistribution obtained by using nonresonant multiphoton ionization of either the\nI or CH3 fragment. The angular distributions and rise times of the two\nfragments differ significantly. These observations can be rationalized through\na consideration of the alignment of the CH3 fragment and the effect of this\nalignment on its detection efficiency. Two extra dissociation channels are\ndetected: one associated with Rydberg states near 9.2 eV that were observed\npreviously in photoelectron studies, and one associated with photodissociation\nof the parent cation around 15 eV.\n",

At higher intensities the production of Ne$^+$\npairs by successive ionization of the two atoms becomes competitive and the\nrespective emitted electrons interfere coherently with the ICD electrons.

The size-dependence of\nthe polarizabilities of the SimCn (m, n = 1 - 4) clusters is more complicated\nthan that of pure Sim and Cn (m, n = 1 - 8) clusters because for a given\ncluster size the heteroatomic clusters have more isomers than the homoatomic\nones. For the shape-dependence, we consider three kinds of shape, linear\n(chain), prolate, and compact. For most clusters, we can clearly observe orders\nof {\\alpha}(linear) > {\\alpha}(prolate) and {\\alpha}(prolate) >\n{\\alpha}(compact) for a given composition. The composition-dependence of\npolarizabilities reveals that the linear clusters have an obvious larger\npolarizability than both the prolate and the compact clusters especially for a\ngiven m/n value. The shape effect makes a main contribution to determine the\nsize of the polarizability. To understand the size of polarizability and the\nevolution of polarizability, we have tried many factors, such as the energy gap\nand binding energy, and defined a new parameter ({\\Delta}q) that characterizes\nthe redistribution of charge in cluster. We find that both the binding energy\nand the {\\Delta}q are more available than the energy gap for reflecting the\nevolution of polarizabilities provided that both the cluster shape and one of\nthe components in cluster are fixed. The correlation between the polarizability\nand the energy gap is poor, in agreement with the previous results.\n",

It is found that the ground states of these\nscandium oxide clusters can be obtained by the sequential oxidation of small\n\"core\" scandium clusters. The fragmentation analysis demonstrates that the ScO,\nSc2O2, Sc2O3, Sc3O3, and Sc3O4 clusters are especially stable. Strong\nhybridizations between O-2p and Sc-3d orbitals are found to be the most\nsignificant character around the Fermi level. In comparison with standard\ndensity functional theory calculations, we find that the screened hybrid\ndensity functional theory can correct the wrong symmetries and yield more\nprecise description for the localized 3d electronic states of scandium.\n",

We here present a\nparticularly efficient common framework for methods beyond semilocal\ndensity-functional theory, including Hartree-Fock (HF), hybrid density\nfunctionals, random-phase approximation (RPA), second-order M{\\o}ller-Plesset\nperturbation theory (MP2), and the $GW$ method. This computational framework\nallows us to use compact and accurate numeric atom-centered orbitals (popular\nin many implementations of semilocal density-functional theory) as basis\nfunctions. The essence of our framework is to employ the \"resolution of\nidentity (RI)\" technique to facilitate the treatment of both the two-electron\nCoulomb repulsion integrals (required in all these approaches) as well as the\nlinear density-response function (required for RPA and $GW$). This is possible\nbecause these quantities can be expressed in terms of products of\nsingle-particle basis functions, which can in turn be expanded in a set of\nauxiliary basis functions (ABFs). The construction of ABFs lies at the heart of\nthe RI technique, and here we propose a simple prescription for constructing\nthe ABFs which can be applied regardless of whether the underlying radial\nfunctions have a specific analytical shape (e.g., Gaussian) or are numerically\ntabulated. We demonstrate the accuracy of our RI implementation for Gaussian\nand NAO basis functions, as well as the convergence behavior of our NAO basis\nsets for the above-mentioned methods. Benchmark results are presented for the\nionization energies of 50 selected atoms and molecules from the G2 ion test set\nas obtained with $GW$ and MP2 self-energy methods, and the G2-I atomization\nenergies as well as the S22 molecular interaction energies as obtained with the\nRPA method.\n",

The study is related to recent experiments at the free\nelectron laser at DESY in which photoelectron spectra from mass-selected,\ncore-shell ionized metal clusters have been recorded. Relaxed and unrelaxed\nbinding energies as well as Kohn-Sham orbital energies are calculated in\nPerdew-Zunger self-interaction-corrected exchange-only local spin-density\napproximation for valence and 2p core electrons in Na clusters up to 58 atoms.\nThe relaxed binding energies follow approximately the metal-sphere behavior.\nThe same behavior is seen in the experiment for sufficiently big clusters,\nindicating perfect screening and that the relaxation energy due to screening\ngoes to the photoelectron. Instead, calculating the kinetic energy of the\nphotoelectrons using unrelaxed binding energies or Kohn-Sham orbital energies\nyields wrong results for core-shell electrons. The screening {\\em dynamics} are\ninvestigated using time-dependent density functional theory. It is shown that\nscreening occurs on two time scales, a core-shell-dependent inner-atomic and an\ninter-atomic valence electron time scale. In the case of Na 2p ionization the\nremaining electrons in the 2p shell screen within tens of attoseconds while the\nscreening due to cluster valence electrons occurs within several hundreds of\nattoseconds. The screening time-scales may be compared to the photon energy and\ncluster size-dependent escape times of the photoelectron in order to estimate\nwhether the photoelectron is capable of picking up the relaxation energy or\nwhether the residual system is left in an excited state.\n",

We have identified the structures of small terbium\ncluster cations Tb (n = 5-9) in the gas phase, by analysis of their vibrational\nspectra. The spectra have been measured via IR multiple photon dissociation of\ntheir complexes with Ar atoms in the 50-250 1/cm range with an infrared free\nelectron laser. Density functional theory calculations using a 4f-in-core\neffective core potential (ECP) accurately reproduce the experimental far-IR\nspectra. The ECP corresponds to a 4f85d16s2 trivalent configuration of terbium.\nThe assigned structures are similar to those observed in several other\ntransition metal systems. From this, we conclude that the bonding in Tb\nclusters is through the interactions between the 5d and 6s electrons, and that\nthe 4f electrons have only an indirect effect on the cluster structures.\n",

Decoherence dynamics can be put in evidence by means of\nrefocusing experiments of the dipolar interactions. The experimental technique\nused in this work is based on the MREV8 pulse sequence. The aim of the work is\nto detect the main features of the Irreversible Quantum Decoherence (IQD) in\nLC, on the basis of the theory presented by the authors recently. The focus is\nlaid on experimentally probing the eigen-selection process in the intermediate\ntime scale, between quantum interference of a closed system and thermalization,\nas a signature of the IQD of the open quantum system, as well as on quantifying\nthe effects of non-idealities as possible sources of signal decays which could\nmask the intrinsic IQD. In order to contrast experiment and theory, the theory\nwas adapted to obtain the IQD function corresponding to the MREV8 reversion\nexperiments. Non-idealities of the experimental setting are analysed in detail\nwithin this framework and their effects on the observed signal decay are\nnumerically estimated. It is found that, though these non-idealities could in\nprinciple affect the evolution of the spin dynamics, their influence can be\nmitigated and they do not present the characteristic behavior of the IQD. As\nunique characteristic of the IQD, the experimental results clearly show the\noccurrence of eigen-selectivity in the intermediate timescale, in complete\nagreement with the theoretical predictions. We conclude that the\neigen-selection effect is the fingerprint of IQD associated with a quantum open\nspin system in LC. Besides, these features of the results account for the\nquasi-equilibrium states of the spin system, which were observed previously in\nthese mesophases, and lead to conclude that the quasi-equilibrium is a definite\nstage of the spin dynamics during its evolution towards equilibrium\n",

The hydrogen adsorption energy is as good as the\nrecently studied charged fullerenes. The hydrogen storage capacity appears to\nbe ~4.3 wt%. The endohedral CO sorption is also analysed with the help of DFT.\nThe first principle DFT calculation and MD simulation are performed to\ninvestigate the effect of lithium doping on the gas adsorbing capacity and\nadsorption enthalpy as well as adsorption energy of ExBox4+.The metal atom\ninteraction with ExBox4+is found to be pretty strong, and the interaction\nenergy appears to be higher than the metal cohesive energy.The thermodynamic\nparameters suggest that metal doping method is spontaneous in nature. The\nanalysis of adsorption energy, thermodynamic properties and MD simulation\nresults suggest that Li doped ExBox4+ can be a promising gas adsorbing\nmaterial. Lithium doping increases the gas adsorption capacity of ExBox4+. The\nLi decorated ExBox4+ is found to adsorb twenty four hydrogen molecules with a\ngravimetric wt% of 6.23. Adsorption of CO on the metal decorated ExBox4+ is\nalso studied. AIM analysis is performed to obtain a general idea of the bonding\ninteraction between Li-H and Li-C.\n",

The Ne2@B12N12 cage dissociates and the Ne atoms get\nseparated as the simulation proceeds. The He-He unit undergoes translation,\nrotation and vibration inside the cavity of B12N12 and B16N16 cages. Electron\ndensity analysis (Atoms-in-Molecule (AIM)) shows that there is some degree of\ncovalent character in He-He bond (Wc type) of He2@B12N12. In case of\nHe2@B16N16, the He-He interaction is mostly of noncovalent type (Wn). In many\ncases, especially for the heavier Ng atoms the Ng-N/B bonds are found to be of\ncovalent type or at least having some degree of covalent character. But Wiberg\nbond indices show zero bond order in He-He bond and very low bond order in\ncases of Ng-N/B bonds. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) provides further\ninsights into the bonding among the Ng atoms and the cage. The change in charge\ndistribution, radius, hardness, electrophilicity and polarizability implies\nthat they possess different properties and reactivity from their parent\nmoieties. The HOMO energies of He2 units in He2@B12N12 and He2@B16N16 are\nsignificantly higher than that in free He atoms. Their kinetic stability and\ndifferent calculated properties imply that the He-He interaction and Ng-N/B\ninteraction may be considered as chemical bonds according to the IUPAC\ndefinition.\n",

The electronic states and\nactive vibrational modes of the benzylium and 1-phenylethyl cations as well as\nthose of their tropylium or methyl tropylium isomers have been calculated with\nab initio methods for comparison with the spectra observed. Sharp vibrational\nprogressions are observed in the visible region while the absorption features\nare much broader in the UV. The visible spectrum of the benzylium cation is\nsimilar to that obtained in an argon tagging experiment [V. Dryza, N. Chalyavi,\nJ.A. Sanelli, and E.J. Bieske, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 204304 (2012)], with an\nadditional splitting assigned to Fermi resonances. The visible spectrum of the\n1-phenylethyl cation also shows vibrational progressions. For both cations, the\nsecond electronic transition is observed in the UV, around 33 000 cm-1 (4.1\neV), and shows a broadened vibrational progression. In both cases the S2\noptimized geometry is non planar. The third electronic transition observed\naround 40 000 cm-1 (5.0 eV) is even broader with no apparent vibrational\nstructures, which is indicative of either a fast non-radiative process or a\nvery large change in geometry between the excited and the ground states. The\noscillator strengths calculated for tropylium and methyl tropylium are weak.\nTherefore, these isomeric structures are most likely not responsible for these\nabsorption features. Finally, the fragmentation pattern changes in the second\nand third electronic states: C2H2 loss becomes predominant at higher excitation\nenergies, for both cations.\n",

Particularly rich information can be\nobtained from measuring the properties of electrons emitted in the course of\nthe excitation dynamics. Such an analysis of electron signals covers total\nionization, Photo-Electron Spectra, Photoelectron Angular Distributions, and\nideally combined PES/PAD, with a long history in molecular physics, also\nincreasingly used in cluster physics. Recent progress in the design of new\nlight sources (high intensity and/or frequency, ultra short pulses) opens new\npossibilities for measurements and thus has renewed the interest on the\nanalysis of dynamical scenarios through these observables, well beyond a simple\naccess to a density of states. This, in turn, has motivated many theoretical\ninvestigations of the dynamics of electronic emission for molecules and\nclusters. A theoretical tool of choice is here Time-Dependent Density\nFunctional Theory (TDDFT) propagated in real time and on a spatial grid, and\naugmented by a Self-Interaction Correction. This provides a pertinent, robust,\nand efficient description of electronic emission including the detailed pattern\nof PES and PAD. A direct comparison between experiments and well founded\nelaborate microscopic theories is thus readily possible, at variance with more\ndemanding observables such as for example fragmentation or dissociation cross\nsections. The aim of this paper is to review the available experimental results\nmotivating such studies, describe the theoretical tools developed on the basis\nof real-time and real-space TDDFT to address in a realistic manner the analysis\nof electronic emission following irradiation of clusters and molecules by\nvarious laser pulses, discuss representative results, and finally give some\nfuture directions of investigations.\n",

Our approach is based on\ntime-dependent density functional theory at the level of the local density\napproximation. This mean-field picture is augmented by collisional correlations\nhandled in relaxation time approximation which is inspired from the\ncorresponding semi-classical picture. The method involves the estimate of\nmicroscopic relaxation rates/times which is presently taken from the well\nestablished semi-classical experience. The relaxation time approximation\nimplies evaluation of the instantaneous equilibrium state towards which the\ndynamical state is progressively driven at the pace of the microscopic\nrelaxation time.\n  As test case, we consider Na clusters of various sizes excited either by a\nswift ion projectile or by a short and intense laser pulse, driven in various\ndynamical regimes ranging from linear to strongly non-linear reactions. We\nobserve a strong effect of dissipation on sensitive observables such as net\nionization and angular distributions of emitted electrons. The effect is\nespecially large for moderate excitations where typical relaxation/dissipation\ntime scales efficiently compete with ionization for dissipating the available\nexcitation energy. Technical details on the actual procedure to implement a\nworking recipe of such a quantum relaxation approximation are given in\nappendices for completeness.\n",

These different\nbehaviors are explained by the role of the postfragmentation interaction in the\ncomplex formed after the C$\\alpha$--C$\\beta$ bond cleavage.\n",

Electron transfer from $He^{-}$ to $(C_{60})_n$ and\n$(C_{70})_n$ clusters results in the formation of the corresponding fullerene\ncluster dianions. This unusual double electron transfer appears to be concerted\nand is most likely guided by electron correlation between the two very weakly\nbound outer electrons in $He^{-}$. We suggest a mechanism which involves long\nrange electron transfer followed by the conversion of $He^{+}$ into\n$He_{2}^{+}$, where formation of the $He-He$ bond in $He_{2}^{+}$ releases\nsufficient kinetic energy for the cation and the dianion to escape their\nCoulombic attraction. By analogy with the corresponding dications, the\nobservation of a threshold size of n \\geq 5 for formation of both\n$(C_{60})_n^{2-}$ and $(C_{70})_n^{2-}$ is attributed to Coulomb explosion\nrather than an energetic constraint. We also find that smaller dianions can be\nobserved if water is added as a co-dopant. Other aspects of $He^{-}$ chemistry\nthat are explored include its role in the formation of multiply charged\nfullerene cluster cations and the sensitivity of cluster dianion formation on\nthe incident electron energy.\n",

From electronic structure theory we find that the\ntheoretical magnetic moments oscillate with cluster size in exact agreement\nwith experimental data.

Using the optimized ground-state\ngeometries, excited states of different clusters were computed using the\nmulti-reference singles-doubles configuration interaction (MRSDCI) approach,\nwhich includes electron correlation effects at a sophisticated level.

The convergence of our\nresults with respect to the basis sets, and the size of the CI expansion was\ncarefully examined. Isomers of a given cluster show a distinct signature\nspectrum, indicating a strong structure property relationship. This fact can be\nused in experiments to distinguish between different isomers of a cluster.\nOwing to the sophistication of our calculations, our results can be used for\nbenchmarking of the absorption spectra and be used to design superior\ntime-dependent density functional theoretical (TDDFT) approaches. The\ncontribution of configurations to many-body wavefunction of various excited\nstates suggests that in most cases optical excitations involved are collective,\nand plasmonic in nature. Optical absorption in planar boron clusters in wheel\nshape, B7, B8 and B9 computed using EOM-CCSD approach, have been compared to\nthe results obtained from TDDFT approach with a number of functionals.

A replotting of\nour protium results as suggested by Hansen gives a best fit mass of 0.6 u,\nshowing that the suggested procedure gives consistently too small mass. Hansen\nalso rejects the rotational energy transfer model as due to our use of D in the\nanalysis of the data. However, this model has been applied successfully in two\nprevious publications, including experiments using protium. Hansen also\nsuggests that the protium is due to a contamination of the source; however, the\ngas feed (H2 or D2) and its result is well controlled and monitored. The most\nlikely source of protons was instead laser-induced nuclear fusion, but the\nlaser intensity in these experiments was a factor three too low to give strong\nfusion. Thus, the suggestion by Hansen is not valid.\n",

The excitedstate of the heterodimer is long lived (2.5 +/-\n0.5) ns with a very broad fluorescence spectrum red-shifted by 4000 cm^{-1}\nwith respect to the excitation spectrum.

        "summary": "  The bound states of two identical dipoles in a harmonic waveguide are\ninvestigated. In the regime of weak dipole-dipole interactions, the local frame\ntransformation (LFT) method is applied to determine the spectrum of dipolar\nconfinement-induced bound states analytically. The accuracy of the LFT approach\nis discussed by comparing the analytical results with the numerical ones based\non a solution of the close-coupling equations. It is found that close to the\nthreshold energy in the waveguide, the LFT method needs to include more partial\nwave states to obtain accurate bound state energies. As the binding energy\nincreases, the LFT method using a single partial wave state becomes more\naccurate. We also compare the bound states in waveguides and in free space. For\nthe bosonic case, the s-wave dominated bound state looks like a free-space\nstate when its energy is below a certain value. For the fermionic case, the\np-wave dominated bound state energies in waveguides and in free-space coincide\neven close to zero energy.\n",

The calculations are\ncarried out in channeling conditions with different impact parameters by\nemploying Ehrenfest dynamics and real--time, time--dependent density functional\ntheory. The satisfactory comparison with available experiments demonstrates\nthat this approach provides an accurate description of electronic stopping\npower. The velocity-proportional stopping power is predicted for protons and\nhelium ions in the low energy region, which conforms the linear response\ntheory. Due to the existence of wide band gap, a threshold effect in extremely\nlow velocity regime below excitation is expected. For protons, the threshold\nvelocity is observable, while it does not appear in helium ions case. This\nindicates the existence of extra energy loss channels beyond the electron--hole\npair excitation when helium ions are moving through the crystal. To analyze it,\nwe checked the charge state of the moving projectiles and an explicit charge\nexchange behavior between the ions and host atoms is found. The missing\nthreshold effect for helium ions is attributed to the charge transfer, which\nalso contributes to energy loss of the ion.\n",

The\ngeometric and electronic properties are reviewed and the implications for the\nability to emit fluorescence are discussed. Free and pure silicon clusters\nproduced in molecular beams appear to have properties that are unfavourable for\nlight emission. However, when passivated or embedded in a suitable host, they\nmay emit fluorescence.

In this theoretical paper on calcium and\nxenon doped He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization\navalanches, termed ignition. We find that the partial loss of seed electrons\nfrom the activated droplets starkly assists ignition, as the Coulomb barrier\nfor ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant\ncations, and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric\nfield. In addition, the dopant ions assist the acceleration of the seed\nelectrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting electron impact\nionizations of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away.\nThe dopants' ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He as well as the\nslingshot effect decrease with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a\ndependence of the dopants' ignition capability on the dopant mass. Here, we\ndevelop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the ignition capability of\ndopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the\nHe atoms and (ii) the overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the\ndistribution of Coulomb barrier heights at He. The relatively long time delays\nbetween the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation times) for\ncalcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by the time it takes to\ndeshield the dopant ions.\n",

The measured rate of\nemission from the stored Cu$_3^-$ ions follows a single power law decay for\nabout 1 ms but then decreases much more rapidly with time.

In a separate experiment, we\nstudied the laser-induced decay of Cu$_6^-$ ions that were excited by 1.13 eV\nor 1.45 eV photons after 46 milliseconds of storage.\n",

Here we\nreport an extensive infrared spectrum of CO-O2, observed in the CO fundamental\nband region using a tunable quantum cascade laser to probe a pulsed supersonic\njet expansion. The rotational energy level pattern derived from the spectrum\nconsists of stacks of levels characterized by the total angular momentum, J,\nand its projection on the intermolecular axis, K. Five such stacks are observed\nin the ground vibrational state, and ten in the excited state (v(CO) = 1). They\nare divided into two groups, with no observed transitions between groups. The\ngroups correspond to different projections of the O2 electron spin, and\ncorrelate with the two lowest rotational states of O2, (N, J) = (1, 0) and (1,\n2). The rotational constant of the lowest K = 0 stack implies an effective\nintermolecular separation of 3.82 Angstroms, but this should be interpreted\nwith caution since it ignores possible effects of electron spin. A new\nhigh-level 4-dimensional potential energy surface is developed for CO-O2, and\nrotational energy levels are calculated for this surface, ignoring electron\nspin. By comparing calculated and observed levels, it is possible to assign\ndetailed quantum labels to the observed level stacks.\n",

The model is based on a\ngeometrical interpretation of the cluster cross section as an effective area\ncomposed of overlapping circular disks that are representative of the atomic\ncontributions. The latter are calculated using a time-dependent\ndensity-functional-theory-based single-particle description with accurate\nexchange-only ground-state potentials. We find that the net capture and\nionization cross sections in p-X$_n$ collisions are proportional to $n^\\alpha$\nwith $2/3 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$. For capture from water clusters at 100 keV impact\nenergy $\\alpha$ is close to one, which is substantially different from the\nvalue $\\alpha=2/3$ predicted by a previous theoretical work based on the\nsimplest-level electron nuclear dynamics method. For ionization at 100 keV and\nfor capture at lower energies we find smaller $\\alpha$ values than for capture\nat 100 keV. This can be understood by considering the magnitude of the atomic\ncross sections and the resulting overlaps of the circular disks that make up\nthe cluster cross section in our model.

        "summary": "  Two different types of experiments were performed. In the first experiment,\nwe studied the low-temperature condensation of vaporized graphite inside bulk\nliquid helium, while in the second experiment, we studied the condensation of\nsingle carbon atoms together with H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO molecules inside helium\nnanodroplets. The condensation of vaporized graphite leads to the formation of\npartially graphitized carbon, which indicates high temperatures, supposedly\nhigher than 1000{\\deg}C, during condensation. Possible underlying processes\nresponsible for the instant rise in temperature during condensation are\ndiscussed. This suggests that such processes cause the presence of partially\ngraphitized carbon dust formed by low-temperature condensation in the diffuse\ninterstellar medium. Alternatively, in the denser regions of the ISM, the\ncondensation of carbon atoms together with the most abundant interstellar\nmolecules (H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO), leads to the formation of complex organic\nmolecules (COMs) and finally organic polymers. Water molecules were found not\nto be involved directly in the reaction network leading to the formation of\nCOMs. It was proposed that COMs are formed via the addition of carbon atoms to\nH$_2$ and CO molecules $(C + H_2 \\rightarrow HCH, HCH + CO \\rightarrow\nOCCH_2)$. Due to the involvement of molecular hydrogen, the formation of COMs\nby carbon addition reactions should be more efficient at high extinctions\ncompared with the previously proposed reaction scheme with atomic hydrogen.\n",

Observation of these decays over very long time scales is\npossible due to the very low residual gas pressure ($\\sim10^{-14}$) and\ncryogenic (13 K) operation of DESIREE. The yield of neutral particles from\nstored beams of Ag$_{6}$ and Ag$_{7}$ anions were measured for 100 milliseconds\nand were found to follow single power law behaviour with millisecond time scale\nexponential cut-offs. The Ag$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$ anions were stored for 60\nseconds and the observed decays show two-component power law behaviors. We\npresent calculations of the rate constants for electron detachment from, and\nfragmentation of Ag$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$. In these calculations, we assume that\nthe internal energy distribution of the clusters are flat and with this we\nreproduce the early steep parts of the experimentally measured decay curves for\nAg$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$, which extends to tens and hundreds of milliseconds,\nrespectively. The fact that the calculations reproduce the early slopes of\nAg$_{4}$ and Ag$_{5}$, which differ for the two cases, suggests that it is the\nchanges in fragmentation rates with internal cluster energies of Ag$_{4}$ and\nAg$_{5}$ rather than conditions in the ion source that determines this\nbehavior. Comparisons with the measurements strongly suggest that the neutral\nparticles detected in these time domains originate from Ag$_{4} \\rightarrow$\nAg$_{3}+$ Ag and Ag$_{5}\\rightarrow$ Ag$_{3}+$ Ag$_{2}$ fragmentation\nprocesses.\n",

        "summary": "  Supersonic helium beams are used in a wide range of applications, for example\nsurface scattering experiments and, most recently, microscopy. The high\nionization potential of neutral helium atoms makes it difficult to build\nefficient detectors. Therefore, it is important to develop beam sources with a\nhigh centre line intensity. Several approaches for predicting the centre line\nintensity exist, with the quitting surface model incorporating the largest\namount of physical dependencies. However, until now only a limited amount of\nexperimental data has been available. Here we present a study where we compare\nthe quitting surface model with an extensive set of experimental data. In the\nquitting surface model the source is described as a sphere from where the\nparticles leave in a molecular flow determined by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\nWe use numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation to determine its\nproperties. The centre-line intensity is then calculated using an analytical\nintegral. This integral can be reduced to two cases, one which assumes a\ncontinuously expanding beam until the skimmer aperture, and another which\nassumes a quitting surface placed before the aperture. We compare the two cases\nto experimental data with a nozzle diameter of 10 micron, skimmer diameters\nranging from 4 micron to 390 micron, a source pressure range from 2 to 190 bar,\nand nozzle-skimmer distances between 17.3 mm and 5.3 mm. To support the two\nanalytical approaches, we have also performed equivalent ray tracing\nsimulations. We conclude that the quitting surface model predicts the centre\nline intensity well for skimmers with a diameter larger than 120 micron when\nusing a beam expanding until the skimmer aperture. For the case of smaller\nskimmers the trend is correct, but the absolute agreement not as good. We\npropose several explanations for this, and test the ones that can be\nimplemented analytically.\n",

The molecular structure,\nfundamental vibrational frequencies with their corresponding intensities and\nmolecular electrostatic potential (MEP) map of SO$_2$ and SO$_2^-$ are\ninterpreted from respective ground state optimized electronic structures\ncalculated using DFT. The quantified MEPs and the second order perturbation\nenergies for different oxygen lone pair (n) to $\\sigma^*$ and $\\pi^*$\ninteractions of S-O bond orbitals have been calculated by carrying out NBO\nanalysis. The change in the electronic structure of the molecule after the\nattachment of a low-energy ($\\leq$ 15 eV) electron, thus forming a transient\nnegative ion, can be interpreted from the $n\\rightarrow\\sigma^*$ and\n$n\\rightarrow\\pi^*$ interactions. The results of the calculations are used to\ninterpret the dissociative electron attachment process. The dissociation of the\nanion SO$_2^-$ into negative and neutral fragments has been explained by\ninterpreting the infrared spectrum and different vibration modes. It could be\nobserved that the dissociation of SO_{2}^{-} into S^{-} occurs as a result of\nsimultaneous symmetric stretching and bending modes of the molecular anion.\nWhile the formation of O$^-$ and SO$^-$ occurs as a result of anti-symmetric\nstretching of the molecular anion. The calculated symmetries of the TNI state\ncontributing to the first resonant peak at around 5.2 eV and second resonant\npeak at around 7.5 eV was observed from time-dependent density functional\ntheory calculations to be an A$_1$ and a combination of A$_1$+B$_2$ states for\nthe two resonant peaks, respectively.

Quantum chemical\ncalculations confirm this Bq+ -> [Bq - CO]+ -> [Bq - 2CO]+ sequence as the\nenergetically most favorable reaction pathway. For the first CO loss, a\ntransition state with a barrier of ~3.2 eV is found, substantially lower than\nthe lowest calculated H loss dissociation pathway (~ 4.9 eV). A similar\nsituation applies for the second CO loss channel (~3.8 eV vs. ~4.7 eV), but\nwhere the first dissociation step does not strongly alter the planar PAH\ngeometry, the second step transforms the molecule into a bowl-shaped one.\n",

The interaction of ammonia ices with other\nhydrogen-boding molecules such as methanol or water and their behavior upon an\nionization are thus relevant in the astrochemical context. In this study,\nammonia clusters (NH3)N with the mean size N ~230 were prepared in molecular\nbeams and passed through a pickup cell in which methanol molecules were\nadsorbed. At the highest exploited pickup pressures, the average composition of\n(NH3)N(CH3OH)M clusters was estimated to be N:M ~210:10. On the other hand, the\nelectron ionization of these clusters yielded about 75% of methanol-containing\nfragments (NH3)n(CH3OH)mH+ compared to 25% contribution of pure ammonia\n(NH3)nH+ ions. Based on this substantial disproportion, we propose the\nfollowing ionization mechanism: The prevailing ammonia is ionized in most\ncases, resulting in NH+4 core solvated most likely with four ammonia molecules,\nyielding the well-known \"magic number\" structure (NH3)4NH+4 . The methanol\nmolecules exhibit strong propensity for sticking to the fragment ion. We have\nalso considered mechanisms of intracluster reactions. In most cases, proton\ntransfer between ammonia units take place. The theoretical calculations\nsuggested the proton transfer either from the methyl group or from the hydroxyl\ngroup of the ionized methanol molecule to ammonia to be the energetically open\nchannels. However, the experiments with selectively deuterated methanols did\nnot show any evidence for the D+ transfer from the CD3 group. The proton\ntransfer from the hydroxyl group could not be excluded entirely nor confirmed\nunambiguously by the experiment.\n",

Depending on the couplings of the internal degrees of\nfreedom, relaxation can be ultrafast, converting electronic energy in a few fs,\nor slow, if the energy is trapped in a metastable state that decouples from its\nenvironment. Here, helium nanodroplets are resonantly excited by femtosecond\nextreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulses from a seeded free-electron laser. Despite\ntheir superfluid nature, we find that helium nanodroplets in the lowest\nelectronically excited states undergo ultrafast relaxation. By comparing\nexperimental photoelectron spectra with time-dependent density functional\ntheory simulations, we unravel the full relaxation pathway: Following an\nultrafast interband transition, a void nanometer-sized bubble forms around the\nlocalized excitation (He*) within 1 ps. Subsequently, the bubble collapses and\nreleases metastable He* at the droplet surface. This study highlights the high\nlevel of detail achievable in probing the photodynamics of nanosystems using\ntunable XUV pulses.\n",

Here, we demonstrate a substantial PECD for very fast photoelectrons\nabove 500 eV kinetic energy released from methyloxirane by a participator\nresonant Auger decay of its lowermost O $1s$-excitation. This effect emerges as\na result of the Fano interference between the direct and resonant\nphotoionization pathways, notwithstanding that their individual effects are\nnegligibly small.

In particular, we investigate the chiral response to the\none-color multiphoton or strong-field ionization by circularly polarized 400\nand 814 nm optical laser pulses or 1850 nm infrared pulse. In addition, the\nbroadband ionization by short coherent circularly polarized 413-1240 nm\nspanning pulse is considered. Finally, the two-color ionization by the\nphase-locked 400 and 800 nm pulses, which are linearly polarized in\nmutually-orthogonal directions, is investigated. The present computational\nresults on the one-color multiphoton ionization of fenchone are in agreement\nwith the available experimental data. For the ionization of fenchone by\nbroadband and bichromatic pulses, the present theoretical study predicts\nsubstantial multiphoton PECDs.\n",

The approach, which takes into account the fraction of the clustered\nsubstance in the jet, is applied to quantitatively analyze integrated\nintensities of the luminescence bands of the neutral and charged excimer\ncomplexes (Rg2)* and (Rg4+)* measured for nanoclusters of three rare gases (Rg\n= Ar, Kr, and Xe) with average sizes ranging from 100 to 18000 atoms per\nclusters (diameters varying from 2 to 13 nm). The amount of the clustered\nsubstance, which affects the absolute values of integrated intensity of the\nbands, is shown to be proportional to the logarithm of the average size of\nclusters in the jet. Analysis of normalized intensities allowed us to\nspectroscopically find two ranges of average sizes of Ar, Kr, and Xe\nnanoclusters which, in accordance with the electron diffraction studies, can be\nassigned to quasicrystalline icosahedral and crystalline fcc structures in\nclusters, as well as to find the cluster size range in which both structures\ncoexist. We show that in fcc clusters the luminescence of the neutral molecules\n(Rg2)* comes from within the volume of the cluster, while the charged excimer\ncomplexes (Rg4+)* emit mostly from subsurface layers.\n",

We present general formulas in the frame of the random\nphase approximation with exchange (RPAE) applied to endohedrals A@CN that\nconsist of an atom A located inside of a fullerenes shell constructed of N\ncarbon atoms C. We calculate the time delay of electrons that leave the inner\natom A in course of A@CN photoionization. Our aim is to clarify the role that\nis played by CN shell. As concrete examples of A we have considered Ne, Fr, Kr\nand Xe, and as fullerene we consider C60. The presence of the C60 shell\nmanifests itself in powerful oscillations of the time delay of an electron that\nis ionized from a given subshell nl by a photon with energy.

Here we present the\nstudy on the cluster formation and the relative reactivity of fullerene cations\n(from smaller to larger, C$_{44}$ to C$_{70}$) with anthracene molecule\n(C$_{14}$H$_{10}$). The experiment is performed in the apparatus that combines\na quadrupole ion trap with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. By using a 355\nnm laser beam to irradiate the trapped fullerenes cations (C$_{60}$$^+$ or\nC$_{70}$$^+$), smaller fullerene cations C$_{(60-2n)}$$^+$, n=1-8 or\nC$_{(70-2m)}$$^+$, m=1-11 are generated, respectively. Then reacting with\nanthracene molecules, series of fullerene/anthracene cluster cations are newly\nformed (e.g., (C$_{14}$H$_{10}$)C$_{(60-2n)}$$^+$, n=1-8 and\n(C$_{14}$H$_{10}$)C$_{(70-2m)}$$^+$, m=1-11), and slight difference of the\nreactivity within the smaller fullerene cations are observed. Nevertheless,\nsmaller fullerenes show obviously higher reactivity when comparing to fullerene\nC$_{60}$$^+$ and C$_{70}$$^+$.\n  A successive loss of C$_2$ fragments mechanism is suggested to account for\nthe formation of smaller fullerene cations, which then undergo addition\nreaction with anthracene molecules to form the fullerene-anthracene cluster\ncations. It is found that the higher laser energy and longer irradiation time\nare key factors that affect the formation of smaller fullerene cations. This\nmay indicate that in the strong radiation field environment (such as\nphoton-dominated regions) in space, fullerenes are expected to follow the\ntop-down evolution route, and then form small grain dust (e.g., clusters)\nthrough collision reaction with co-existing molecules, here, smaller PAHs.\n",

These modifications\ninfluence the photoionization dynamics of the endofullerene.

More remarkably, the photoexcited plasmons, both the giant plasmon and\nthe higher energy plasmon, in decay in parts through $Na_{20}$ ionization\ncontinuum via the resonant intercluster Coulombic decay (ICD) process. These\nlead to dramatic enhancements in the ionization of individual $Na_{20}$-type\nlevels resulting enhancements in the cluster's total ionization yield.

The technique offers a number of advantages such as the very low energy\nof the incident probing atoms (less than 0.1 eV), unsurpassed surface\nsensitivity (no penetration into the sample bulk), a charge neutral, inert\nprobe and a high depth of field. This opens up for a range of interesting\napplications such as: imaging of fragile and/or non-conducting samples without\ndamage, inspection of 2D materials and nano-coatings, with the possibility to\ntest properties such as grain boundaries or roughness on the Angstr\\\"om scale\n(the wavelength of the incident helium atoms) and imaging of samples with high\naspect ratios, with the potential to obtain true to scale height information of\n3D surface topography with nanometer resolution: nano stereo microscopy.\nHowever, for a full exploitation of the technique, a range of experimental and\ntheoretical issues still needs to be resolved. In this paper we review the\nresearch in the field. We do this by following the trajectory of the helium\natoms step by step through the microscope: from the initial acceleration in the\nsupersonic expansion used to generate the probing beam over the atom optical\nelements used to shape the beam, followed by interaction of the helium atoms\nwith the sample (contrast properties) to the final detection and\npost-processing.

The\nmetallic substrate plays the role of an environment that produces an energy\nuncertainty on the adatom. This broadening induces a critical behavior not\npossible in a quantum closed system. We use suitable approximations on\nsymmetry, together with both Lanczos and canonical transformations, to give\nanalytical estimates for the critical parameters of molecular dissociation.\nThis occurs when the bonding to the surface is (\\sqrt{2}) times the molecular\nbonding. This value is slightly weakened for less symmetric situations. However\nsimple, this conclusion involves a high order perturbative solution of the\nmolecule-catalyst system. This model is further simplified to discuss how an\nenvironment-induced critical phenomenon can be evaluated through an idealized\nperturbative tunneling microscopy set-up. In this case, the energy\nuncertainties in one or both atoms are either Lorentzian or Gaussian. The\nformer results from the Fermi Golden Rule, i.e., a Markovian approximation. The\nGaussian uncertainty, associated with non-Markovian decoherent processes,\nrequires the introduction of a particular model of a spin bath. The partially\ncoherent tunneling current is obtained from the Generalized Landauer-B\\\"uttiker\nEquations. The resonances observed in these transport parameters reflect, in\nmany cases, the critical properties of the resonances in the molecular\nspectrum.\n",

FH2 and FH4 cluster energies and\nstructures -obtained from energy optimization through a basin-hoping algorithm\nas well as classical Monte Carlo simulations- are reported and compared with\nreference path integral Monte Carlo calculations. For temperatures $T> 4$ K,\nboth FH2 and FH4 potentials are able to correct the purely classical\ncalculations in a consistent way.

We\ninvestigate the upper bounds of hydrogen storage capacities of $C_{60}Cs$\nclusters grown in ultracold helium nanodroplets by analyzing anomalies in the\nion abundance that indicate shell closure of hydrogen adsorption shells. On\nbare $C_{60}^{+}$, a commensurate phase with 32 $H_2$ molecules was identified\nin previous experiments. Doping $C_{60}$ with a single cesium atom leads to an\nincrease in relative ion abundance for the first 10 $H_2$ molecules, and the\nclosure of the commensurate phase is shifted from 32 to 42 $H_2$ molecules.\nDensity functional theory calculations indicate that thirteen energetically\nenhanced adsorption sites exist, where six of them fill the groove between Cs\nand $C_{60}$ and 7 are located at the cesium atom. We emphasize the large\neffect of the quantum nature of the hydrogen molecule on the adsorption\nenergies, i.e. the adsorption energies are decreased by around 50% for\n$(H_2)C_{60}Cs$ and up to 80% for $(H_2)C_{60}$ by harmonic zero-point\ncorrections, which represent an upper bound to corrections for dissociation\nenergies ($D_e$ to $D_0$) by the vibrational ground states. Five normal modes\nof libration and vibration of $H_2$ physisorbed on the substrate contribute\nprimarily to this large decrease in adsorption energies.

        "summary": "  A robust potential wherein is embedded the crucial core polarization\ninteraction is used in the Regge Pole methodology to calculate low energy\nelectron elastic scattering total cross section (TCS) for the C60 fullerene in\nthe electron impact energy range 0.02 through 10.0 eV. The energy position of\nthe characteristic dramatically sharp resonance appearing at the second\nRamsauer Townsend (RT) minimum of the TCS representing stable C60 fullerene\nnegative ion formation agrees excellently with the measured electron affinity\n(EA) of C60 [Huang et al 2014 J. Chem. Phys. 140 224315]. The benchmarked\npotential and the Regge-pole method are then used to calculate electron elastic\nscattering TCSs for selected fullerenes, from C54 through C240. The TCSs are\nfound to be characterized generally by RT minima, shape resonances (SRs) and\ndramatically sharp resonances representing long lived ground state fullerene\nnegative ion formation. For the TCSs of C70, C76, C78, and C84 the agreement\nbetween the energy positions of the very sharp resonances, corresponding to the\nbinding energies (BEs) of the resultant fullerene negative ions, and the\nmeasured EAs is outstanding. Additionally, we extract the BEs of the resultant\nfullerene negative ions from our calculated TCSs of the C86, C90 and C92\nfullerenes with estimated EAs larger than 3.0 eV by the experiment [Boltalina\net al, 1993 Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 7 1009] as well as of other\nfullerenes, including C180 and C240. Most of the TCSs presented in this paper\nare the first and only. Our novel approach is general and should be applicable\nto other fullerenes as well and complex heavy atoms, such as the lanthanide\natoms. We conclude with a remark on the catalytic properties of the fullerenes\nthrough their negative ions.\n",

The resulting system consists of atoms\nin various electronic configurations, thermalizing on sub-picosecond to\npicosecond timescales after photoexcitation.

XMDYN is capable of treating\nsystems containing light and heavy atomic species with full electronic\nconfiguration space and 3D spatial inhomogeneity.

About 60 years later, scientists\nsuccessfully observed this phenomenon in the microscopic world though the\nspectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in helium nano-droplets. This\nreduction of scale suggests that not only helium but also para-H2 (pH2) can be\na candidate for superfluidity. This expectation is based on the fact that the\nsmaller number of neighbours and surface effects of a finite-size cluster may\nhinder solidification and promote a liquid-like phase. The first prediction of\nsuperfluidity in pH2 clusters was reported in 1991 based on quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The possible superfluidity of pH2 was later indirectly observed in\na spectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in 2000. Since then, a growing\nnumber of studies have appeared, and theoretical simulations have been playing\na special role because they help guide and interpret experiments. In this\nreview, we go over the theoretical studies of pH2 superfluid clusters since the\nexperiment of 2000. We provide a historical perspective and introduce the basic\ntheoretical formalism along with key experimental advances. We then present\nillustrative results of the theoretical studies and comment on the possible\nfuture developments in the field.

Here, we have\napplied the picosecond time-resolved near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR)\nspectroscopies to the phenol--(NH 3) 5 cluster, the bench mark system of ESHT,\nand monitored the electron transfer and proton motion independently. The\nelectron transfer monitored by the NIR transition rises within 3 ps while the\noverall H transfer detected by the IR absorption of NH vibration appears with\nthe lifetime of $\\approx$20 ps.

In close analogy to\nconventional Penning electron spectroscopy by thermal atomic collisions, the n\n= 2 photoexcitation band plays the role of the metastable atomic $1s2s$\n$^{3,1}S$ He$^\\ast$. This facilitates electron spectroscopy of acetylene\naggregates in the sub-kelvin He environment, providing the following insight\ninto their structure: The molecules in the dopant cluster are loosely bound van\nder Waals complexes rather than forming covalent compounds. In addition, this\nwork reveals a Penning process stemming from the n = 4 band where\ncharge-transfer from autoionized He in the droplets is known to be the dominant\nrelaxation channel. This allows for excited states of the remnant dopant\noligomer Penning-ions to be studied.

While modelling the\ncoupling between spin states and local vibrations allows to determine the more\nrelevant molecular vibrations for spin relaxation, this is not sufficient to\nexplain how energy is dissipated towards the thermal bath.

A periodic modulation of the transient ICD signals is tentatively\nattributed to the oscillation of the bubble forming around the localized He\nexcitation. The ICD efficiency depends on the total number of excited states in\na droplet rather than the density of excited states pointing to a collective\nenhancement of ICD.\n",

Extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of free nanoparticles is a\npowerful tool for studying the photophysics and photochemistry of resonantly\nexcited or ionized nanometer-sized condensed-phase systems. Here we demonstrate\nthis capability by performing photoelectron-photoion coincidence (PEPICO)\nexperiments with pure and doped superfluid helium nanodroplets. Different\ndoping options and beam sources provide a versatile platform to generate\nvarious van der Waals clusters as well as He nanodroplets.

Despite its simplicity the presented model\nexhibits surprisingly rich physics and enables a detailed analysis of the\ndifferent loss processes depending on field parameters and initial arrangement\nof the particle and the field. Depending on those parameters regions of\ndifferent steady states emerge: a region with dominating N\\'eel relaxation and\nhigh magnetic losses and another region region with high frictional losses at\nlow fields or low frequencies. The energy increases continuously even across\nregime boundaries up to frequencies above the Brownian relaxation limit.

In N$_2$, for a certain window of\nXUV energies around 50 eV, we observe a marked occupation inversion, i.e. a\nsituation where depletion of the deepest bound valence electron state is much\nlarger than for any other state. This represents a realistic mechanism which is\nable to cut, almost instantaneously, a hole into a deep lying state, a\nsituation which is often assumed ad hoc in numerous theoretical studies of\nenergetic ultrafast processes. This occupation inversion furthermore drives a\ndipole instability, i.e. a spontaneous reappearance of the dipole signal long\nafter the laser pulse is over and the dipole signal has died out. The dipole\nsignal that emerges from this instability can be identified as a particular\nlow-energy structure in photo-electron spectra.\n",

He$_n$Au$^+$ appears to adopt two\nadditional solvation shells of $I_h$ symmetry, containing 20 and 12 atoms,\nrespectively. For Ar$_n$Au$^+$, with $\\sigma$* $\\approx$ 0.67, one would expect\na solvation shell of octahedral symmetry, in agreement with an enhanced ion\nabundance at $n$ = 6. Another anomaly in the ion abundance at Ar$_9$Au$^+$\nmatches a local maximum in its computed dissociation energy.\n",

The technique involves formation of large, superfluid helium\nnanodroplets that are subsequently electron ionized, mass-selected by\ndeflection in an electric field, and doped with silver atoms and noble gases\n(Ng) in pickup cells. Excess helium is then stripped from the doped\nnanodroplets by multiple collisions with helium gas at room temperature,\nproducing cluster ions that contain no more than a few dozen noble gas atoms\nand just a few (or no) silver atoms. Under gentle stripping conditions helium\natoms remain attached to the cluster ions, demonstrating their low vibrational\ntemperature. Under harsher stripping conditions some of the heavier noble gas\natoms will be evaporated as well, thus enriching stable clusters Ng$_n$Ag$_m^+$\nat the expense of less stable ones. This results in local anomalies in the\ncluster ion abundance which is measured in a high-resolution time-of-flight\nmass spectrometer. Based on these data we identify specific \"magic\" sizes n of\nparticularly stable ions. There is no evidence though for enhanced stability of\nNg$_2$Ag$^+$, in contrast to the high stability of Ng$_2$Au$^+$ that derives\nfrom the covalent nature of the bond for heavy noble gases. \"Magic\" sizes are\nalso identified for Ag$_2^+$ dimer ions complexed with He or Kr.

For\nsmall sizes the enrichment is much larger than previously reported for bare\nneon clusters grown in nozzle expansions and subsequently ionized. The\nenrichment is traced to the massive evaporation of neon atoms in a collision\ncell that is used to strip helium from the HNDs. We derive a relation between\nthe enrichment of $^{22}$Ne in the cluster ion and its corresponding depletion\nfactor $F$ in the vapor phase. The value thus found for $F$ is in excellent\nagreement with a theoretical expression that relates isotopic fractionation in\ntwo-phase equilibria of atomic gases to the Debye temperature. Furthermore, the\ndifference in zero-point energies between the two isotopes computed from F\nagrees reasonably well with theoretical studies of neon cluster ions that\ninclude nuclear quantum effects in the harmonic approximation. Another fitting\nparameter provides an estimate for the size s$_i$ of the precursor of the\nobserved Ne$_s^+$. The value is in satisfactory agreement with the size\nestimated by modeling the growth of Ne$_s^+$, and with lower and upper limits\ndeduced from other experimental data. On the other hand, neon clusters grown in\nneutral HNDs that are subsequently ionized by electron bombardment exhibit no\nstatistically significant isotope enrichment at all. The finding suggests that\nthe extent of ionization-induced dissociation of clusters embedded in HNDs is\nconsiderably smaller than for bare clusters.\n",

        "summary": "  Collective excited states form in organic two-dimensional layers through the\nCoulomb coupling of the molecular transition dipole moments. They manifest as\ncharacteristic strong and narrow peaks in the excitation and emission spectra\nthat are shifted to lower energies compared to the monomer transition. We study\nexperimentally and theoretically how robust the collective states are against\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening as well as spatial disorder that occur\nin real molecular monolayers. Using a microscopic model for a two-dimensional\ndipole lattice in real space we calculate the properties of collective states\nand their extinction spectra. We find that the collective states persist even\nfor 1-10% random variation in the molecular position and in the transition\nfrequency, with similar peak position and integrated intensity as for the\nperfectly ordered system. We measure the optical response of a monolayer of the\nperylene-derivative MePTCDI on two-dimensional materials. On the wide band-gap\ninsulator hexagonal boron nitride it shows strong emission from the collective\nstate with a line width that is dominated by the inhomogeneous broadening of\nthe molecular state. When using the semimetal graphene as a substrate, however,\nthe luminescence is completely quenched. By combining optical absorption,\nluminescence, and multi-wavelength Raman scattering we verify that the MePTCDI\nmolecules form very similar collective monolayer states on hexagonal boron\nnitride and graphene substrates, but on graphene the line width is dominated by\nnon-radiative excitation transfer from the molecules to the substrate. Our\nstudy highlights the transition from the localized molecular state of the\nmonomer to a delocalized collective state in the two-dimensional molecular\nlattice that is entirely based on Coulomb coupling between optically active\nexcitations of the electrons or molecular vibrations.\n",

In these molecules, bound levels above the\nionization energy can be populated via strong, resonant transitions from the\nground state. The only relevant decay channel of these levels is\nautoionization; predissociation is energetically not possible and radiative\ndecay is many orders of magnitude slower. Starting from translationally cold\nneutral molecules, translationally cold molecular ions can thus be produced\nwith very high efficiency. By populating bound levels just above the ionization\nenergy, internally cold molecular ions, exclusively occupying the lowest\nrotational level, are produced. This is experimentally shown here for the\ndysprosium monoxide molecule, DyO, for which the lowest bond dissociation\nenergy is determined to be 0.0831(6) eV above the ionization energy.\n",

The resulting structures are lower in energy than previously\nreported results. The structural and energetic stability of these clusters are\nstudied using various descriptors such as binding energy, ionization\npotentials, fragmentation energy, first and second energy difference,\nvibrational and optical spectra. The energetic analysis shows that clusters\nwith N = 4, 8, 12, 14, 16 and 19 are more stable. The analysis of fragmentation\nenergies also supports these findings. Our calculations show that non-covalent\ninteractions play a significant role in stabilizing the water clusters.

An electrometer in the charge mode with its probe\nattached to the base under study was used. A reference for the electrometer was\nestablished by grounding the electrometer probe at a specific crystal\ntemperature, i.e., zeroing the electrometer. When the ground is broken an\ninduced charge, held captive by the polarization charge at the base of the\ncrystal, remains in the probe circuit. Then as the temperature of the crystal\nis changed the electrometer reads the change in the polarization charge with\nrespect to the polarization charge at the zeroing temperature. Data was\nobtained for each type of crystal and at the -z and +z bases for three\ndifferent grounding conditions. Each experiment consisted of data accumulation\nfor five thermal cycles. The electrometer readings at a given temperature\nappeared to be different for the three grounding conditions but the difference\nin the charge readings for a given difference of temperature was independent of\nthe grounding situation. Measurements of the polarization charge were taken\nwhile the temperature of the crystal was held constant for about fourteen\nhours.

Further lowering of temperatures induced\nnano-crystallization of the interior atoms that proceeded from the surface\ntowards the core region, finally leading to an icosahedral structure.

As an example, perylene in solid and liquid n-alkane matrices was\nchosen, and all shifts are calculated relative to one well-defined\nsolid-inclusion system. It is shown that a simple two-level treatment of the\nsolute using Huckel theory yields spectral shifts in excellent agreement with\nexperimental results for the most prominent inclusion sites of perylene in\nsolid n-alkane surroundings and for the dilute solutions in liquid n-alkanes.\nThe idea is general enough to be applied to any aromatic chromophore in a\nnonpolar solvent matrix. In contrast to earlier treatments, this approach is\nbased on geometry-dependent polarizabilities, employs a r^-4 dependence for the\ndispersion energy, is conceptually simple and computationally efficient.\nDifferent simple models based on our general approach to compute the UV\nspectral shifts due to solvation indicate that the dispersive part of the\nvan-der-Waals energy, which stabilizes the LUMO of perylene more than the HOMO,\nfalls off with a distance dependence of r^-4 in a range up to ~1 nm and not as\nr^-6, as has been assumed for a long time. This finding corresponds to the\ninterpretation of temporary dipoles as being equivalent to weak permanent\ndipoles with fluctuating orientation.\n",

Our calculations demonstrate that ATI protonation\nshould occur at the nitrogen atom of the imidazoline ring rather than at the\namino group. Protonation of ATI leads to a decrease in a spin density on the\nnitrogen atom of the nitroxide fragment >N-O. For simulation of ATI hydration\neffects, we have constructed a water shell around a spin label molecule by\nmeans of gradual (step-by-step) surrounding of ATI with water molecules (n =\n2-41). Calculated spin density on the nitrogen atom of the nitroxide fragment\nincreased with an extension of a water shell around ATI. Both protonation and\nhydration of ATI caused certain changes in calculated geometric parameters\n(bond lengths and valence angles). Investigating how structural and energy\nparameters of a system ATI-(H2O)n depend on a number of surrounding water\nmolecules, we came to the conclusion that a hydrogen-bonded cluster of n\n&#8805; 41 water molecules could be considered as an appropriate model for\nsimulation of ATI hydration effects.\n",

The\nbinding is weak for Na_2, which has a full valence electron shell. The presence\nof substrate modifies the structures of Na_3, Na_4, and Na_5 significantly, and\nboth Na_4 and Na_5 are distorted from planarity.

A systematic study of\nenergetics, structure, growth, and stability of also larger clusters has been\ncarried through without more or less severe assumptions on the initial\ngeometries in the structure optimization, on the symmetry, or on bond lengths.\nIt is shown that cluster growth is predominantly icosahedral with $islands$ of\n{\\it fcc}, {\\it tetrahedral} and {\\it decahedral} growth.

In addition, it is shown that conversion from the {\\it\nhcp}/anti-Mackay kind of icosahedral growth to the {\\it fcc}/Mackay one occurs\nwithin a transition layer including several cluster sizes.

That is, the dimer's lowest energy configuration is not necessarily\na stack, as it might had been expected a priori. This is a surprising result\nfor dimer of such a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) as coronene.\nThe energy of the T-shaped configuration at all considered levels of density\nfunctional theory (B3LYP,PBE/6-31+G(d),D95,cc-pVDZ,cc-pVTZ) was systematically\nlower than the energies of three plausible stack configurations. In order to\nget a better description of the van der Waals interaction,the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) results were adjusted by adding a phenomenological\nLennard-Jones-type term into the total energy of the system. However, the van\nder Waals correction is somewhat arbitrary and its magnitude can not be\nrigorously justified. Depending on the choice of the parameters in the\nphenomenological term both the T-shaped and the parallel-displaced (PD) stack\nconfigurations can be the global energy minimum of the system. A simple model\nis proposed which is useful for qualitative understanding of possible\ngeometries of the coronene dimer and larger coronene clusters. The model\nrepresents coronene dimer as two sets of charged rings interacting via Coulomb\nand Lennard-Jones potentials. The model provides an intuitively clear\nexplanation why the T-shaped dimers can be of importance even for some of\nmoderately large PAHs such as coronene and, may be, for circumcoronene.\n",

It\nis shown that the direct two-photon population (DTP) and off-resonant\nstimulated Raman (ORSR) scattering can be effectively used for excitation of\nthe quadrupole states in high-frequency (quadrupole plasmon) and low-frequency\n(infrared) regions, respectively. In ORSR, isolated dipole particle-hole states\nas well as the tail of the dipole plasmon can serve as an intermediate state. A\nsimultaneous study of low- and high-frequency quadrupoles, combining DTP and\nORSR, is most effective. Femtosecond pulses with intensities $I = 2\\cdot\n10^{10} - 2\\cdot 10^{11} W/cm^2$ and pulse durations $T = 200 - 500$ fs are\nfound to be optimal. Since the low-lying quadrupole states are dominated by one\nsingle electron-hole pair, their energies, being combined with the\nphotoelectron data for hole states, allow to get the electron spectrum above\nthe Fermi level and thus greatly extend our knowledge on the single particle\nspectra of clusters. Besides, the developed schemes allow to estimate the\nlifetime of the quadrupole states.\n",

In this paper we present a more detailed account of the matter. In\nparticular we show that the absorption efficiency is almost independent of the\nlaser polarization. In the rigid-sphere model, the absorbed energy increases by\nmany orders of magnitude at a certain threshold laser intensity.

The ratio between\nthe interatomic distance and the theoretical electron orbit radius (the\ndimensional ratio) for K19 in n = 4 is found to be 2.8470 +- 0.0003. For\nclusters K19 (n = 6) and K37 (n = 7 and 8) the dimensional ratio 2.90 is the\nhighest value that is found, which happens to be exactly the theoretical value.\nClusters K61 and K91 in n = 5 and 6 have slightly lower dimensional ratios.\nThis is expected since the edge effects are smaller.

The dispersion coefficients are obtained via Casimir-Polder relation.\nThe calculations are carried out with two different exchange-correlation\npotentials: (i) the asymptotically correct statistical average of orbital\npotential (SAOP) and (ii) Vosko-Wilk-Nusair representation of\nexchange-correlation potential within local density approximation. A comparison\nwith the other theoretical results has been performed. We also present the\nresults for the static polarizabilities of sodium clusters and also compare\nthem with other theoretical and experimental results. These comparisons reveal\nthat the SAOP results for C_{6} and static polarizability are quite accurate\nand very close to the experimental results. We examine the relationship between\nvolume of the cluster and van der Waals coefficient and find that to a very\nhigh degree of correlation C_{6} scales as square of the volume. We also\npresent the results for van der Waals coefficient corresponding to cluster-Ar\natom and cluster-N_{2} molecule interactions.\n",

In the present\nwork, previous mathematical considerations are revisited which support the\npossible coexistence of Antihydrogen with Hydrogen, Deuterium and Tritium\natoms. In particular, the main objective of the present work is to present\ncomputational treatments which confirm the possible formation of these quasi\nmolecules in laboratory. These treatments are based on a nonadiabatic picture\nof the system in which generalized basis functions are adjusted within the\nframework of Rayleigh-Ritz' variational method. Thus, it is ruled out in the\npresent work the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic picture of the system, which\ndemands the existence of bound states composed of fixed quasi heavy atoms\n(containing at least two baryons, e.g. protonium (Pn), with mean lifetime\n1.0x10^^-6 s) and quasi light atoms (composed of two leptons, e.g. positronium\n(Ps), with mean lifetime 125x10^^-12 s for para-Ps and 142.05x10^^-9 s for\northo-Ps). Our calculations of the binding energies and internal structure of\nAntihydrogen-Hydrogen, Antihydrogen-Deuterium and Antihydrogen-Tritium show\nthat these quasi molecules are bound and could be formed in nature. On the\nother hand, having in mind the adiabatic picture of the systems, our results\nsuggest the possible formation of these molecules as resonant states in\nAntihydrogen-Atom interaction.

As the first\nexample we discuss the 4d10 Giant resonance in Xe@C60 whereas as the second\nserves the Giant autoionization resonance in Eu@C60. The qualitative difference\ncomes from the fact that photoelectrons from the 4d Giant resonance has small\nenergies (tens of eV) and are strongly reflected by the C60 fullerenes shell.\nAs to the Eu@C60, Giant autoionization leads to fast photoelectrons (about\nhundred eV) that go out almost untouched by the C60 shell. As a result of the\noutgoing electrons energy difference the atomic Giant resonances will be\nlargely destroyed in A@C60 while the Giant autoionization resonance will be\nalmost completely preserved. Thus, on the way from Xe@C60 Giant resonance to\nEu@C60 Giant autoionization resonance the oscillation structure should\ndisappear. Similar will be the decrease of oscillations on the way from pure\nGiant to pure Giant autoionization resonances for the angular anisotropy\nparameters. At Giant resonance frequencies the role of polarization of the\nfullerenes shell by the incoming photon beam is inessential. Quite different is\nthe situation for the outer electrons in Eu@C60, the photoionization of which\nwill be also considered.\n",

With the goal in mind to put in\nevidence this short-range electrostatic force, the Madelung potential arising\nat the surface of the ionic crystal is primarily derived. The expression of the\nforce which is deduced can be split into two major contributions: the first\nstands for the coupling between the microscopic structure of the tip apex and\nthe capacitor formed between the tip, the ionic crystal and the\ncounter-electrode; the second term depicts the influence of the Madelung\nsurface potential on the mesoscopic part of the tip, independently from its\nmicroscopic structure. These short-range electrostatic forces are in the range\nof ten pico-Newtons. When explicitly considering the crystal polarization, an\nanalytical expression of the bias voltage to be applied on the tip to\ncompensate for the local CPD, i.e. to cancel the short-range electrostatic\nforce, is derived. The compensated CPD has the lateral periodicity of the\nMadelung surface potential. However, the strong dependence on the tip geometry,\nthe applied modulation voltage as well as the tip-sample distance, which can\neven lead to an overestimation of the real surface potential, makes\nquantitative KPFM measurements of the local CPD extremely difficult.\n",

In the phase transition\nregion, the assembly (and fragmentation) of the C60 cage from (and to) the\ngaseous state is demonstrated via the dynamical coexistence of two phases. In\nthis critical region, the fullerene system is seen to continuously oscillate\nbetween the carbon cage (the solid phase) and the state of carbon dimers and\nshort chains (the gas phase). These oscillations correspond to consecutive\ndisintegration and formation of the fullerene.

The\nsimulations were conducted for 500 ns using a topologically-constrained\npairwise forcefield which was developed for this work. Results of the\nsimulations were supplemented by a statistical mechanics analysis to account\nfor entropy and pressure corrections, corresponding to experimental conditions.\nThese corrections lead to a phase transition temperature of 3800-4200 K for\npressure 10-100 kPa, in good agreement with available experimental values.\n",

If the penetration of electrons into the\nnucleus is taken into account, various corrections to these multipole\ninteractions appear. The best known one is a scalar correction related to the\nisotope shift and the isomer shift. This paper discusses a related tensor\ncorrection, which modifies the quadrupole interaction if electrons penetrate\nthe nucleus: the quadrupole shift. We describe the mathematical formalism and\nprovide first-principles calculations of the quadrupole shift for a large set\nof solids. Fully relativistic calculations that explicitly take a finite\nnucleus into account turn out to be mandatory. Our analysis shows that the\nquadrupole shift becomes appreciably large for heavy elements. Implications for\nexperimental high-precision studies of quadrupole interactions and quadrupole\nmoment ratios are discussed. A literature review of other small quadrupole-like\neffects is presented as well.\n",

Adsorption in the pi-bonded mode dominates over\nthe di-sigma mode over all considered cluster sizes n, with the exception of\nthe neutral C2H4-Au5 system. A striking difference is found in the\nsize-dependence of the adsorption energy of C2H4 bonded to the neutral gold\nclusters in the pi and di-sigma configurations. The important role of the\nelectronic shell effects in the di-sigma mode of ethylene adsorption on neutral\ngold clusters is demonstrated.

The optical absorption calculations are\nperformed using both the semi-empirical and the ab initio approaches.

The \\emph{ab\ninitio} calculations are performed within a\ntime-dependent-density-functional-theory (TDDFT) methodology. The results for\nthe two approaches are in very good qualitative agreement with each other.\nQuantitatively speaking, results agree with each other in the lower energy\nregion, while in the higher energy region, features predicted by the TDDFT\napproach are red-shifted as compared to the INDO-CI results. Both the\napproaches predict that the optical absorption begins at much lower energies in\nthe icosahedral cluster as compared to the planar one, a fact which can be\nutilized in experiments to distinguish between the two geometries.

        "summary": "  A beam of rotating dipolar particles (molecules or clusters) will broaden\nwhen passed through an electric or magnetic field gradient region. This\nbroadening, which is a common experimental observable, can be expressed in\nterms of the variance of the distribution of the resulting polarization\norientation (the direction cosine). Here the broadening for symmetric-top and\nlinear rotors is discussed. These two types of rotors have qualitatively\ndifferent low-field orientation distribution functions, but behave similarly in\na strong field. While analytical expressions for the polarization variance can\nbe derived from first-order perturbation theory, for experimental guidance it\nis important to identify the applicability and limitations of these\nexpressions, and the general dependence of the broadening on the experimental\nparameters. For this purpose, the analytical results are compared with the full\ndiagonalization of the rotational Stark-effect matrices. Conveniently for\nexperimental estimations, it is found that for symmetric tops the dependence of\nthe broadening parameter on the rotational constant, the axial ratio, and the\nfield strength remains similar to the analytical expression even outside of the\nperturbative regime. Also, it is observed that the shape envelope, the\ncentroid, and the width of the orientation distribution function for a\nsymmetric top are quite insensitive to the value of its rotational constant\n(except at low rotational temperatures).\n",

The optical properties of the system are studied and it is shown\nthat the group velocity of light pulse can be controlled by relative phase of\napplied fields. By changing the relative phase of applied fields, the group\nvelocity of light pulse changes from transparent subluminal to the transparent\nsuperluminal light propagation. Thus, the phase-controlled absorption-free\nsuperluminal light propagation is obtained without applying an incoherent laser\nfields to the system. The propagation of a weak probe light pulse is studied by\nsolving the Maxwell's wave equation on numerical grid in space and time.\nMoreover, we study the third order self- and cross-Kerr susceptibility of probe\nfield and calculate the nonlinear cross-phase shift for different values of\nintensity of applied fields. In addition, we take into account the effect of\nDoppler broadening on the light pulse propagation and it is found that a\nsuitable choice of laser propagation directions allows us to preserve our\nresults even in the presence of Doppler effect. It is demonstrated that by\nincreasing the Doppler width of distribution to the room temperature, the\ndispersion changes from transparent subluminal to transparent superluminal\nlight propagation which is our major motivation for this work.\n",

With the\nsemi-classical analysis, we find, for the first time, the pronounced electron\nlocalization is established by the interferences through different channels of\none- and, more importantly, higher-order photon coupling. Interestingly, due to\nthe enhanced high-order above-threshold dissociation of heavier isotopes, the\ninterference maxima gradually become in phase with growing mass and ultimately\nlead to the anomalous isotopic behavior of the electron localization.

Here we propose a new\ncascade mechanism initiated by core excitation and terminated by ICD and\ndemonstrate its properties. Explicit calculations show that the energies of the\nemitted ICD-electrons can be controlled by selecting the initial atomic\nexcitation. The properties of the cascade may have interesting applications in\nthe fields of electron spectroscopy and radiation damage. Initiating such a\ncascade by resonant X-ray absorption from a high-Z element embedded in a\ncancerous cell nucleus, ICD will deliver genotoxic particles \\textit{locally}\nat the absorption site, increasing in that way the controllability of the\ninduced damage.\n",

The aim of\nthis work is to provide experimental evidence of several QI, in the proton NMR\nof small spin clusters, besides those already known Zeeman, and dipolar orders\n(strong and weak). We explore the spin states prepared with the\nJeener-Broekaert pulse sequence by analyzing the time-domain signals yielded by\nthis sequence as a function of the preparation times, in a variety of dipolar\nnetworks. We observe that the signals can be explained with two dipolar QIs\nonly within a range of short preparation times. At longer times the time-domain\nsignals have an echo-like behaviour. We study their multiple quantum coherence\ncontent on a basis orthogonal to the z-basis and see that such states involve a\nsignificant number of correlated spins.

The introduced potentials describe the exact\ncorrelations for the calculated systems including the formation of a\npositronium atom.

We also calculate self-consistent two-component\ndensity-functional theory positron potentials and densities for the bound\npositronic systems within the local density approximation. They are in a very\ngood agreement with the many-body results, provided that the\nfinite-positron-density electron-positron correlation potential is used, and\nthey can also describe systems comprising a positronium atom. We argue that the\nintroduced single-particle positron potentials defined for single molecules are\ntransferable to the condensed phase when the inter-molecular interactions are\nweak. When this condition is fulfilled, the total positron potential can be\nconstructed in a good approximation as the superposition of the molecular\npotentials.\n",

However, this\nstudy shows that the formation of very small water clusters significantly\ndeviates from this mechanism and instead involves both hydrogen bonding and\nelectron delocalization. Our density functional theory calculations show that\nsmall water rings (H2O)n of n=3 or 4 show strong electron delocalization\noriginating from both the hydrogen and oxygen atoms and extending to the ring\ncenter. This is very different from larger rings. Further energy decomposition\nof rings with n=3-6 demonstrates an upward trend in the polarization component\nbut an decrease in the electrostatic and exchange repulsion components,\npresenting a minimum and accounting for 33% of interaction energy at n=3. This\nsignificantly promotes stability of the small water rings. Our findings provide\na comprehensive analysis and improve our understanding of the stability\ncharacteristics of water clusters.\n",

The presence of the uranium atom\nmakes the Au14 structure more stable than the empty Au14-cage, with a triplet\nground electronic state for U@Au14. Analysis of the electronic structure shows\nthat the two frontier single-occupied molecular orbital electrons of U@Au14\nmainly originate from the 5f shell of the U atom after charge transfer.\nMeanwhile, the bonding orbitals have both the 5f and 6d components of the U\natom, along with the 5d and 6s components of the Au atoms, indicating the\ncovalent nature of the interaction between the U and Au atoms. Moreover, the\ncharge population analysis shows that this nanostructure displays some unique\nelectronic properties where the encapsulated atom gains electrons while the\nouter shell loses electrons. Therefore, this designed U@Au14 nano-cage\nstructure is stabilized by ionocovalent interactions. The current findings\nprovide theoretical basis for future syntheses and further study of actinide\ndoped gold nanoclusters, which might subsequently facilitate applications of\nsuch structure in radio-labeling, nanodrug carrier and other biomedical\napplications.\n",

Calculations of the Dyson orbitals are presented both for the\ntime-independent as well as the time-dependent situations.

        "summary": "  Recent very large molecular dynamics simulations of homogeneous nucleation\nwith $(1-8) \\cdot 10^9$ Lennard-Jones atoms [Diemand et al. J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf\n139}, 074309 (2013)] allow us to accurately determine the formation free energy\nof clusters over a wide range of cluster sizes. This is now possible because\nsuch large simulations allow for very precise measurements of the cluster size\ndistribution in the steady state nucleation regime. The peaks of the free\nenergy curves give critical cluster sizes, which agree well with independent\nestimates based on the nucleation theorem. Using these results, we derive an\nanalytical formula and a new scaling relation for nucleation rates: $\\ln J' /\n\\eta$ is scaled by $\\ln S / \\eta$, where the supersaturation ratio is $S$,\n$\\eta$ is the dimensionless surface energy, and $J'$ is a dimensionless\nnucleation rate. This relation can be derived using the free energy of cluster\nformation at equilibrium which corresponds to the surface energy required to\nform the vapor-liquid interface. At low temperatures (below the triple point),\nwe find that the surface energy divided by that of the classical nucleation\ntheory does not depend on temperature, which leads to the scaling relation and\nimplies a constant, positive Tolman length equal to half of the mean\ninter-particle separation in the liquid phase.\n",

The\ndynamical behavior of atom- photon entanglement between the dressed atom and\nits spontaneous emission is studied in semi classical approach beyond the\ntwo-photon resonance condition in such a system. The quantum entropy of these\ntwo subsystems is investigated by using the von Neumann entropy. It is shown\nthat, the degree of entanglement measure (DEM) can be controlled via the\nintensity and the detuning of coupling optical field and quantum interference\ninduced by spontaneous emission. Moreover in the absence of quantum\ninterference the steady state behavior of DEM can be achieved even in beyond\nthe two- photon resonance condition. Furthermore in the absence of quantum\ninterference for special parameters of Rabi frequency and detuning of driving\nlaser field disentanglement can be occurred.

These\nvariations are discussed in comparison with the behaviour of two different\nmetallic specimen materials, an Al-6XXX series alloy and pure W, studied under\nclosely related experimental conditions in the same atom probe instrument.

We\nfocus our attention on the mechanisms by which rotational and translational\ndegrees of freedom of the water monomers gain energy from these sub-cycle\npulses with an electric field amplitude of up to about 0.6~V/{\\AA}. It has been\nrecently shown that pulses with these characteristics can be generated in the\nlaboratory [PRL 112, 213901 (2014)]. Through their permanent dipole moment,\nwater molecules are acted upon by the electric field and forced off their\npreferred hydrogen-bond network conformation. This immediately sets them in\nmotion with respect to one another as energy quickly transfers to their\nrelative center of mass displacements. We find that, in the bulk, the operation\nof these mechanisms is strongly dependent on the initial temperature and\ndensity of the system. In low density systems, the equilibration between\nrotational and translational modes is slow due to the lack of collisions\nbetween monomers. As the initial density of the system approaches 1~g/cm$^3$,\nequilibration between rotational and translational modes after the pulse\nbecomes more efficient. In turn, low temperatures hinder the direct energy\ntransfer from the pulse to rotational motion owing to the resulting stiffness\nof the hydrogen bond network. For small clusters of just a few water molecules\nwe find that fragmentation due to the interaction with the pulse is faster than\nequilibration between rotations and translations, meaning that the latter\nremain colder than the former after the pulse.\n",

We obtain bright wide-angle scattering patterns, that allow us to\nuniquely identify hitherto unresolved prolate shapes of superfluid helium\ndroplets. Our results mark the advent of single-shot gas-phase nanoscopy with\nlab-based short-wavelength pulses and pave the way to ultrafast coherent\ndiffractive imaging with phase-controlled multicolor fields and attosecond\npulses.\n",

Spin-flip dynamics is\nusually considered in the context of valence electronic states, where\nspin-orbit coupling is weak and processes related to the electron spin are\nusually driven by nuclear motion. However, for core-excited states, where the\ncore hole has a nonzero angular momentum, spin-orbit coupling is strong enough\nto drive spin-flips on a much shorter time scale. Using density matrix based\ntime-dependent restricted active space configuration interaction including\nspin-orbit coupling, we address an unprecedentedly short spin-crossover for the\nexample of L-edge (2p$\\rightarrow$3d) excited states of a prototypical Fe(II)\ncomplex. This process occurs on a time scale, which is faster than that of\nAuger decay ($\\sim$4\\,fs) treated here explicitly. Modest variations of carrier\nfrequency and pulse duration can lead to substantial changes in the spin-state\nyield, suggesting its control by soft X-ray light.\n",

The observed transient lattice response can be well\ninterpreted as a distinct three-step dynamics due to the propagation of\ncoherent acoustic phonons generated by the photoinduced quasiparticles (QP).\nEmploying a normalized phonon propagation model, we found that the photoinduced\nangular shifts of the Bragg peak collapse into a universal curve after\nintroducing a normalized coordinates to account for different thicknesses and\npump photon energies, pinpointing the origin of the lattice distortion and its\nearly evolution. In addition, a transient photocurrent measurement indicates\nthat the photoinduced QPs are charge neutral excitons.

Although the intrinsic electric\nfield plays an imperative role in a solar cell, its effect on the multiple\nexciton generation (MEG) has been overlooked, so far.

The\nsame electric field, however, has insignificant effects on the MEG quantum\nprobabilities and the thresholds in these nanocrystals.

Simulations also demonstrate that an\nelectric field affects the MEG characteristics in the Pb4Te4 nanocrystal, in\ngeneral, less than it perturbs MEG characteristics in Pb4Se4 and Pb4S4\nnanocrystals.

In order that studies on different types of\nnanotubes be comparable, the chiral vectors of C and Si-C nanotubes are\nselected as (7,7) and (5,5), respectively, so that a similar volume of fluid is\ninvestigated flowing through two similar dimension membranes. Different\nhydrostatic pressures are applied and the flow rates of water and ions are\ncalculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Consequently, according to\nconductance of water per each nanotube, per nanosecond, it is perceived that at\nlower pressures (below 150 MPa) the Si-C nanotubes seem to be more applicable,\nwhile higher hydrostatic pressures make carbon nanotube membranes more suitable\nfor water desalination.\n",

To\nprevent spin flipping at room temperature due to thermal fluctuation, large\nmagnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) over 50 meV in magnetic nanostructure is\ndesired for practical applications. We chose one of the smallest magnetic\nnanostructures-Ir2 dimer, to investigate its magnetic properties and explore\npossible approach to engineer the magnetic anisotropy. Through systematic\nfirst-principles calculations, we found that the Ir2 dimer already possesses\ngiant MAE of 77 meV. We proposed an effective way to enhance the MAE of the Ir2\ndimer to 223~294 meV by simply attaching a halogen atom at one end of the Ir-Ir\nbond. The underlying mechanism for the record high MAE is attributed to the\nmodification of the energy diagram of the Ir2 dimer by the additional\nhalogen-Ir bonding, which alters the spin-orbit coupling Hamiltonian and hence\nthe magnetic anisotropy. Our strategy can be generalized to design other\nmagnetic molecules or clusters with giant magnetic anisotropy.\n",

In energy space,\nthe quantum states of the conduction electrons cross over the metal's Fermi\nenergy continuously. But when gold is dispersed in finite nanometer-size\nparticles or 'clusters', the delocalized electronic states are re-grouped in\nenergy space to 'shells' according to allowed energy levels and the symmetry\nand shape of the atomic arrangement. This re-grouping generates also an energy\ngap in the vicinity of the Fermi energy akin to the energy gap between occupied\nand unoccupied electron orbitals in molecules. How does the formation of these\nshells and the energy gap affect the physico-chemical properties of the\nnanoparticle? How does one get from a 'molecule-like' gold nanoparticle to\n'metal-like' gold nanoparticle? Here we analyse the electronic structure and\noptical and chiroptical properties of recently reported gold nanoparticles of\n144, 146, and 246 gold atoms, that are made by wet chemistry methods and whose\nstructures have been resolved to atomic precision. We demonstrate\ncomputationally how re-grouping of the quantum states of valence electrons can\naffect drastically the optical properties of nanoparticles in the\ncrossover-size region, by either generating a multi-band molecule-like or a\nmonotonous metallic optical absorption. The lower the symmetry of the gold\ncore, the more metallic is the nanoparticle. The underlying mechanism arises\nfrom symmetry-sensitive distribution of the electronic levels of the\nnanoparticle close to Fermi energy. Overall, this work sheds lights on\nfundamental mechanisms on how molecular nanoparticle properties can change\nmetallic in the crossover-size region.\n",

The ground states of the fullerenes\nare modeled in a spherical jellium frame of the local density approximation\n(LDA) method with the exchange-correlation functional based on the van Leeuween\nand Baerends (LB94) model potential, while the positron impact and Ps formation\nare treated in the continuum distorted-wave final state (CDW-FS) approximation.\n",

In this paper, we discuss how and why the slowest\nrelaxation rates of relaxation modes are reconstructed from the first passage\ntimes. As an illustrative model, we use a continuous-time Markov state model of\nvacancy diffusion in KCl nanoclusters. Using this model, we reveal that all\ncharacteristics of the relaxations in KCl nanoclusters come from the fact that\nthey are hybrids of two kinetically different regions of the fast surface and\nslow bulk diffusions. The origin of the different diffusivities turns out to\ncome from the heterogeneity of the activation energies on the potential energy\nlandscapes. We also develop a stationary population method to compute the mean\nfirst passage times as mean times required for pair annihilations of\nparticle-hole pairs, which enables us to obtain the symmetric results of\nrelaxation rates under the exchange of the sinks and the sources. With this\nsymmetric method, we finally show why the slowest relaxation times can be\nreconstructed from the mean first passage times.\n",

On account of\nthe radiation damage caused by secondary electrons, we inspect the energy and\nangular distributions of the emitted electrons from the atomic targets. We\nexamine seventeen molecules: DNA and RNA bases, DNA backbone, pyrimidines,\ntetrahydrofuran (THF), and C n H n compounds. We show that the simple\nstoichiometric model (SSM), which approximates the molecular ionization cross\nsections as a linear combination of the atomic ones, gives reasonably good\nresults for complex molecules. We also inspect the extensively used Toburen\nscaling of the total ionization cross sections of molecules with the number of\nweakly bound electrons. Based on the atomic CDW results, we propose new active\nelectron numbers, which leads to a better universal scaling for all the targets\nand ions studied here in the intermediate to the high energy region. The new\nscaling describes well the available experimental data for proton impact,\nincluding small molecules. We perform full molecular calculations for five\nnucleobases and test a modified stoichiometric formula based on the Mulliken\ncharge of the composite atoms. The difference introduced by the new\nstoichiometric formula is less than 3%, which indicates the reliability of the\nSSM to deal with this type of molecules.

Both pressure broadening and shift of the high pressure buffer\ngas D lines system are determined. We also discuss some prospects, including\npossible advances in collisional laser cooling and optical thermometry.\n",

Radiosensitizing properties of NPs may depend on many different\nparameters (such as size, composition and density) of the metal core, organic\ncoatings and the molecular environment. A systematic exploration of each of\nthese parameters on the atomistic level remains a costly experimental task but\nit can be addressed by means of advanced computational modeling. This paper\noutlines a detailed computational procedure for the construction and\natomistic-level characterization of radiosensitizing metal NPs in explicit\nmolecular media. The procedure is general and extensible to many different\ncombinations of the core, coating and environment. As an illustrative and\nexperimentally relevant case study, we consider nanometre-sized gold NPs coated\nwith thiol-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine molecules of different length and\nsurface density and solvated in water at ambient conditions. Radial\ndistribution of different atoms in the coatings as well as distribution and\nstructural properties of water around the coated NPs are analyzed and linked to\nradiosensitizing properties of the NPs. It is revealed that the structure of\nthe coating layer on the solvated NPs depends strongly on the surface density\nof ligands. At surface densities below $\\sim$3 molecules/nm$^{2}$ the coating\nrepresents a mixture of different conformation states, whereas elongated\n\"brush\"-like structures are formed at higher densities of ligands. The water\ncontent in denser coatings is significantly lower at distances from 1 to 3 nm\nfrom the gold surface depending on the length of ligands. Such dense and thick\ncoatings may suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals by low-energy\nelectrons emitted from the metal NPs and thus diminish their radiosensitizing\nproperties.\n",

Their structures\nare linear for M = Li, Na, K, trigonal planar M = Be, Mg, Ca, and tetrahedral\nfor M = B, Al. These anions are energetically and thermodynamically stable\nagainst various fragmentations. Their superhalogen property has been\nestablished due to their higher vertical detachment energy (VDE) than halogen,\nbeing in the range 4.44-7.81 eV. For a given k, the stability and VDE of\nM(BO)$_{k+1}^-$ anions decrease with the increase in the size of M, which is\ndue to a decrease in the charge delocalization on BO moieties. There exists a\nlinear correlation between frontier orbitals energy gap and VDE with the\ncoefficient, R$^2$ = 0.93888. It was also noticed that BO ligand, due to lower\ndimerization energy, can be preferably used as an inorganic analog of CN.

The dimer and monomer\nfluorescence emissions were observed simultaneously in all the solvents. The\nmonomer to dimer fluorescence intensity ratio has been calculated and found\nthat at a certain concentration of RhB the magnitude of the ratio is different\nin different solvents. The ratio becomes equivalent to one for 1.5 gm per l, 3\ngm per l and 4.2 gm per l, concentration of RhB in water, ethanol and propanol\nrespectively. This concentration of RhB at which the monomer to dimer ratio\nbecomes unity is proposed as critical concentration. Above this critical\nconcentration, the dimeric fluorescence dominates and below which the monomeric\nfluorescence dominates. Moreover, in the solvent for which the magnitude of\ncritical concentration is less the fluorophore molecule aggregates more easily\nand vice versa. So, water is found to be the most suitable solvent for RhB\nmolecules for self-aggregation than ethanol and propanol but with less dimeric\nquantum yield. It is also observed that the critical concentration varies\ninversely with the dielectric constant of the solvents. Altogether, it can be\nsaid that the proposed ratio and critical concentration quantify the\naggregation process of the fluorophore in the solvent. Hence, the critical\nconcentration value of the fluorophore could be assumed as the characteristic\nparameter to study the aggregation behaviour of the fluorophore in solvents.\nThe described method has the merit of use in the study of lasing ability and\nthe wavelength tunability of the dye laser gain media as well as in the heavy\nmetal sensing technology in water.

This\ncombined methodology is shown to be instrumental towards revealing the\ntemperature-dependent structural motifs in Au nanoclusters of sizes 90, 147,\nand 201 atoms. The reported phenomenology is particularly rich, displaying a\nsize- and temperature-dependent competition between the global energy minimum\nand other structural motifs.

In\ncontrast, the Au$_{201}$ cluster undergoes a solid-solid transformation at low\ntemperature (< 200 K). Results indicate that PTMD and HSA very well agree at\nintermediate temperatures, between 300 and 400 K.

Our TDDFT calculations disentangle\nthe contribution from each ionization channel based on the Kohn-Sham\nwavefunctions.\n",

Analysis of the spectrum yields a direct\nmeasurement of the in-plane / out-of-plane splitting measured to be 0.8770\ncm-1.

The weak-field cases have been\nstudied previously in the context of NMR, where the shielding tensor was\ndetermined by correcting the Diamagnetic Shielding operator up to the second\norder. However, the magnetic fields due to the Neutron Stars are extremely high\nand cannot be treated perturbatively. Thus, in the interest of the\nastrophysical and astrochemical community, this review aims to elaborate on the\ncomputational advancements in quantum mechanics from Hartree-Fock (HF) to\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT), in the context of molecules in a high (and\nultrahigh) magnetic field. It is found that the mean-field approximation of\nelectron-electron correlation, as in the case of Hartree-Fock Theory, yields\ninaccurate results. On the contrary, CCSD and DFT are found to overcome these\nchallenges. However, treating eletron-electron correlations in DFT can be\nchallenging for heavier ions as transition metals. To circumvent this, we\npropose the use of DFT/CCSD along with effective Hamiltonian methods, which are\nlikely to offer physical insights with reasonable accuracy.\n",

It was further\nfound as a rule that the ionization dynamics is insensitive to the C60 level\nthe electron originates from to produce X-@C60+. In the current study, we\nreport an exception to this rule in F@C60. It is found that when the electron\nvacancy is situated in the C60 level that participates in the hybridization in\nF-@C60+, the mixing becomes dramatically large leading to strong modifications\nin the photoionization of the hybrid levels. But when the vacancy is at any\nother pure level of C60, the level-invariance is retained showing weak\nhybridization. Even though this case of F@C60 is an anomaly in the halogen@C60\nseries, the phenomenon can be more general and can occur with compounds of\nother atoms caged in a variety of fullerenes.

The emissions, properties and concentrations of\natmospheric aerosols or aerosol precursors could respond significantly to\nclimate change. Despite the importance for climate, the detailed nucleation\nmechanisms are still poorly understood. The ultimate goal of theoretical\nunderstanding aerosol nucleation is to simulate nucleation in ambient\ncondition, hindered by lack of accurate reactive force field. Here we propose\nthe reactive force field for nucleation systems with good size scalability\nbased on deep neural network. The huge computational costs from direct\nmolecular dynamics in ambient conditions are surmounted by bridging the\nsimulation in the limited box with cluster kinetics, facilitating the aerosol\nnucleation simulation to be fully ab initio. We found that the acid-base\nformation rates previously based on hard sphere collision rate constants tend\nto be underestimated up to several times. These findings show that the widely\nrecognized acid-base nucleation observed in the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor\nDroplets) chamber experiments, pristine and polluted environments should be\nrevisited to considering the contribution of collision enhancement. Besides,\nthe framework here is transferable to other nucleation systems, potentially\nboosting the nucleation parameterizations accuracy generally to effectively\nadvance the climate model predictions reliability.\n",

Unsupervised machine learning\nmethods are applied to clean the database in an automated manner. These\ntechniques purge the data by removing suspicious outliers and old isolated\nvalues. A large portion of the remaining data is used to train a deep neural\nnetwork, while the rest is set aside, constituting the test set. The present\nwork considers collisional systems only with atomic targets. The first version\nof the ESPNN (electronic stopping power neural-network code), openly available\nto users, is shown to yield predicted values in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental results of the test set.\n",

These can be quite complicated, as for\ninstance in the TIP5P model with five-site potential for a rigid\ntetrahedral-shaped H$_2$O monomer of water, or as simple as the Lennard-Jones\nsingle-site potential for the center of an atomic monomer (which is also used\nfor one site of the H$_2$O monomer in the TIP5P model, that in addition has\nfour peripheral sites with Coulomb potentials). The empirical usefulness of the\nnecessary condition is demonstrated by testing a list of publicly available\nLennard-Jones cluster data that have been pooled from 17 sources, covering the\ninterval $2\\leq N\\leq 1610$ without gaps. The data point for $N=447$ failed\nthis test, meaning the listed $447$-particle Lennard-Jones cluster energy was\nnot optimal.

The\nmeasured kinetic energy distribution $P(E_{\\text{kin}})$ of both the Ak$^{+}$\nand the Ak$^{\\prime +}$ fragment ions contains overlapping peaks due to\ncontributions from Coulomb explosion of the homonuclear and the heteronuclear\ndimers. Using a coincident filtering method based on the momentum division\nbetween the two fragment ions in each Coulomb explosion event, we demonstrate\nthat the individual $P(E_{\\text{kin}})$ pertaining to the ions from either the\nheteronuclear or from the homonuclear dimers can be retrieved, for both the\nAk$^{+}$ and for the Ak$^{\\prime +}$ fragment ions.

In particular, this method is applicable to complicated\nspectrometer geometries with largely anisotropic ion collection efficiencies. A\ncalibration procedure using a single ion mass peak allows the accurate\ndetermination of parameters related to the spectrometer calibration,\nexperimental alignment and instrument response function, which improves the\nagreement between simulations and experiment. The calibrated simulation is used\nto generate a set of basis functions for the time-of-flight spectra, which are\nthen used to transform from time-of-flight to kinetic-energy spectra. We\ndemonstrate this reconstruction method on a recent pump-probe experiment by\nAsmussen et al. (J. D. Asmussen et al., Phys. Chem. Chem.

To correctly interpret these detections, a complex analysis is\nnecessary that takes into account the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(non-LTE) conditions of the emitting media (e.g. when energy level populations\ndeviate from a Boltzman distribution). This requires proper state-to-state\ncollisional data for the excitation and de-excitation processes of the\nmolecular levels. Cyclopentadiene (c-C5H6), which was recently detected in\nmultiple cold interstellar clouds, is extensively studied in many aspects due\nto its large importance for chemistry in general. At the same time, there are\nno collisional data available for this species, which are necessary for a more\nprecise interpretation of the corresponding detections. In this work, we first\nprovide an accurate 3D rigid-rotor interaction potential for the [c-C5H6 + He]\ncomplex from high-level of ab initio theories, which has been used to study\ntheir inelastic collision by the exact close coupling quantum scattering\nmethod. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where this method\nis systematically applied to treat the dynamics of molecular collisions\ninvolving more than ten atoms. We also analyse the collisional propensity rules\nand the differences in contrast to calculations, where the approximate coupled\nstates scattering methods is used.\n",

Among the most abundant elements and isotopes\nfound in nature, 10B has one of the highest neutron absorption cross-sections,\nclosely followed by 6Li. It is worth noting that hydrogen, with its light\nnucleus, serves as an excellent neutron reflector. Surprisingly, the potential\nof the lithium borohydride molecule (LiBH4), which consists exclusively of\nthese elements, as a shield against neutron radiation has not yet been\nexplored. This study investigates various materials that can potentially be\nused as shields. First, we assessed traditional shields and previous\noptimizations for shielding. The findings showed that concrete containing 10%\nB4C yielded the best results. High-performance concrete (HPC) replaced regular\nconcrete. By gradually incorporating lithium borohydride into the shield, along\nwith the appropriate level of boron carbide, further optimization was achieved.\nCalculations were performed using the MCNPX 2.7E code. The introduction of the\nnew shield resulted in a significant 40% reduction in volume compared with the\nprevious sample. The study findings showed that a 30 cm thick shield\neffectively blocked 95% of the total neutrons and 92% of the total gamma\nradiation. Additionally, it was noted that the shielding effects of lithium\nborohydride against fast neutrons are greater than those of boron carbide.\nVarious parameters and data of the designed shield were calculated and compared\nwith those of the previous sample.\n",

All calculations are performed using both a\nfrozen atomic target and a dynamic response model using the coupled-channel\ntwo-center basis generator method for orbital propagation. All one- and two-\nelectron removal processes are calculated, though particular attention is paid\nto those that result in the Ne$^{+}$-Ne$^{+}$ fragmentation channel due to its\nassociation with interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD). We confirm in all analyses\nand models that Ne(2$s$) electron removal is strong so that ICD will contribute\nto dimer fragmentation as has been previously demonstrated.

The calculations are performed within density functional\ntheory, at the all electron level, with large basis sets, and within the\ngeneralized gradient approximation. The vertical ionization potential (VIP) and\nstatic dipole polarizability are also reported. The\n  S_4 and S_8 cages are energetically nearly degenerate and are favored over\nthe O cage which has six extra octagons and squares. The IR and Raman spectra\nof the three clusters show notable differences providing thereby a way to\nidentify and possibly synthesize the cages.\n",

Our\nanalysis supports a very general picture of the charging and heating dynamics\nin finite samples under short-wavelength radiation that is of relevance for\nseveral applications of free-electron lasers. First, up to a certain photon\nflux, ionization proceeds as a series of direct photoemission events producing\na jellium-like cluster potential and a characteristic plateau in the\nphotoelectron spectrum as observed in [Bostedt {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 100}, 013401 (2008)]. Second, beyond the onset of photoelectron trapping,\nnanoplasma formation leads to evaporative electron emission with a\ncharacteristic thermal tail in the electron spectrum. A detailed analysis of\nthis transition is presented. Third, in contrast to the behavior in the\ninfrared or low vacuum ultraviolet range, the nanoplasma energy capture\nproceeds via {\\it ionization heating}, i.e., inner photoionization of localized\nelectrons, whereas collisional heating of conduction electrons is negligible up\nto high laser intensities. A direct consequence of the latter is a surprising\nevolution of the mean energy of emitted electrons as function of laser\nintensity.\n",

For molecular pairs composed of a He\natom and an S-state atom, the molecular spin is stable during formation,\ndissociation, and collisions, and thus these molecules can be magnetically\ntrapped. Collisional spin relaxations are too slow to affect trap lifetimes.\nHowever, helium-3-containing complexes can change spin due to adiabatic\ncrossings between trapped and untrapped Zeeman states, mediated by the\nanisotropic hyperfine interaction, causing trap loss.

To obtain the main features of the effect, we\nsubstitute the complex fullerenes shell CN by a static zero thickness\npotential, express its deformation under incoming electron action via CN\npolarizabilities.

The results of calculations are compared\nto those obtained for pure water medium. It is demonstrated that a significant\nincrease in the number of emitted electrons arises from collective electron\nexcitations in the nanoparticle. The dominating enhancement mechanisms are\nrelated to the formation of (i) plasmons excited in a whole nanoparticle, and\n(ii) atomic giant resonances due to excitation of d electrons in individual\natoms. Decay of the collective electron excitations in a nanoparticle embedded\nin a biological medium thus represents an important mechanism of the low-energy\nelectron production. Parameters of the utilized model approach are justified\nthrough the calculation of the photoabsorption spectra of several gold\nnanoparticles, performed by means of time-dependent density-functional theory.\n",

        "summary": "  From microscopic point-dipole model calculations of the screening of the\nCoulomb interaction in non-polar systems by polarizable atoms, it is known that\nscreening strongly depends on dimensionality. For example, in one dimensional\nsystems the short range interaction is screened, while the long range\ninteraction is anti-screened. This anti-screening is also observed in some zero\ndimensional structures, i.e. molecular systems. By means of ab-initio\ncalculations in conjunction with the random-phase approximation (RPA) within\nthe FLAPW method we study screening of the Coulomb interaction in FexOy\nclusters. For completeness these results are compared with their bulk\ncounterpart magnetite. It appears that the onsite Coulomb interaction is very\nwell screened both in the clusters and bulk. On the other hand for the\nintersite Coulomb interaction the important observation is made that it is\nalmost contant throughout the clusters, while for the bulk it is almost\ncompletely screened. More precisely and interestingly, in the clusters\nanti-screening is observed by means of ab-initio calculations.\n",

These theories incorporate electron-electron correlation into the\neffective paradigm and through their computational implementation, a diverse\nset of small muonic species is considered as a benchmark at these post-EHF\nlevels. A comparative computational study on this set demonstrates that the\nmuonic bond length is in general non-negligibly longer than corresponding\nhydrogenic analogs.

Best performance is found\nfor the double hybrid DFA B3LYP+XYG3 with a mean absolute error of 0.7 kcal/mol\nand a maximum error of 1.8 kcal/mol. While MP2 performs similarly as\nB3LYP+XYG3, computational costs, i.e. timings, are increased by a factor of 4\nin comparison due to the large basis sets required for accurate results.\n",

Recently, a number\nof laboratories have reported generation of continuum harmonics in the\nhundred-electron-volt to kilovolt region with few-cycle long-wavelength\nmid-infrared lasers. These harmonics have the bandwidth to support pulses with\nduration of few- to few-ten attoseconds. But harmonics generated in a gas\nmedium have attochirps that cannot be fully compensated by materials over a\nbroad spectral range; thus, realistically what are the typical shortest\nattosecond pulses that one can generate? To answer this question, it is\nessential that the temporal attosecond pulses be accurately characterized. By\nre-analyzing the soft X-ray harmonics reported in three recent experiments\n\\cite{chang_natcom2017,Thomas_OE2017,Bieger_2017PRX} using a newly developed\nbroadband phase retrieval algorithm, we show that their generated attosecond\npulses are all longer than about 60 as. Since broadband pulses tend to have\nhigh-order chirps away from the spectral center of the pulse, the algorithm has\nto be able to retrieve accurately the phase over the whole bandwidth. Our\nre-evaluated pulse durations are found to be longer than those previously\nreported. We also introduce the autocorrelation (AC) of the streaking\nspectrogram. By comparing the ACs from the experiments and from the retrieved\nSXR pulses, the accuracy of the retrieved results can be directly visualized to\nensure that correct phases have been obtained. Our retrieval method is fast and\naccurate, and it shall provide a powerful tool for the metrology of\nfew-ten-attosecond pulses in the future.\n",

Using hard X-ray radiation provides scattering images that\nencode two-dimensional projections, which can be combined to identify the full\nthree-dimensional object structure from multiple identical samples. Wide-angle\nscattering using XUV or soft X-rays, despite yielding lower resolution,\nprovides three-dimensional structural information in a single shot and has\nopened routes towards the characterization of non-reproducible objects in the\ngas phase. The retrieval of the structural information contained in wide-angle\nscattering images is highly non-trivial, and currently no efficient rigorous\nalgorithm is known. Here we show that deep learning networks, trained with\nsimulated scattering data, allow for fast and accurate reconstruction of shape\nand orientation of nanoparticles from experimental images. The gain in speed\ncompared to conventional retrieval techniques opens the route for automated\nstructure reconstruction algorithms capable of real-time discrimination and\npre-identification of nanostructures in scattering experiments with high\nrepetition rate -- thus representing the enabling technology for fast\nfemtosecond nanocrystallography.\n",

The practical case of an external\nharmonic oscillator squeezing potential acting on a two-body system is\ninvestigated in details.

Here we report the N dependent plasmonic evolution of atomically\nsize selected gold particles with N= 100 70000 using electron energy loss (EEL)\nspectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The EEL mapping\nassigns a feature at 2.7 eV as the bulk plasmon and another at 2.4 eV as\nsurface plasmon, which evolution reveals three regimes. When N decreases from\n70000 to 887, the bulk plasmon stays unchanged while the surface plasmon\nexhibits a slight red shift from 2.4 to 2.3 eV. It can be understood by the\ndominance of classical plasmon physics and electron boundary scattering induced\nretardation. When N further decreases from 887 to 300, the bulk plasmon\ndisappears totally and the surface plasmon shows a steady blueshift, which\nindicates that the quantum confinement emerges and modifies the intraband\ntransition. When N 100 300, the plasmon is split to three fine features, which\nis attributed to superimposed single electron transitions between the quantized\nmolecular like energy level by the time dependent density functional theory\ncalculations. The surface plasmon's excitation ratio has a scaling law with an\nexponential dependence on N ( N^0.669), essentially the square of the radius.

In this work, we investigate the properties of quadrupolar\nanions as extreme halo systems, the formation of rotational bands, and the\ntransition from a subcritical to supercritical electric quadrupole moment.

We demonstrate that\nbinding energies and radii of quadrupolar anions strictly follow the scaling\nlaws for two-body halo systems.

On this basis, the\nnumber of electrons released through the organic coating into the surrounding\naqueous medium and the number of hydroxyl radicals produced are evaluated.

        "summary": "  The quantum theory of atoms in molecules, QTAIM, is employed to identify AIM\nand quantify their interactions through the partitioning of molecule into\natomic basins in the real space and it is confined only to the purely\nelectronic systems composed of electrons as quantum particles and the nuclei as\nclamped point charges. The extended version of the QTAIM, called the\nmulti-component QTAIM, MC-QTAIM, bypasses this border and makes it possible to\nidentify AIM and quantify their interactions in systems composed of multiple\nquantum particles that electrons may or may not be one of their components\nopening a new door for the analysis of the exotic AIM and bonds. In this\ncontribution, two conjectures, called Bader conjecture, BC, and extended Bader\nconjecture, EBC, are proposed as the cornerstones of the real-space\npartitioning of a molecule into atomic basins within the context of the QTAIM\nand the MC-QTAIM, respectively. A literature survey on various few-body quantum\nsystems composed of quarks, nucleons, and elementary particles like muons and\npositrons is also done unraveling the fact that in all these diverse systems\nthere are unambiguous cases of clusterizations. These clustered systems,\nirrespective to their components, behave as if they are molecules composed of\nsome kind of atoms, instead of being an amorphous mixture of quantum particles.\nIn the case of the muonic and the positronic molecules computational studies\nreveal that the AIM structures of these systems are well-captured by the EBC.\nBeyond identifying atomic basins, both QTAIM and MC-QTAIM attribute properties\nto AIM, which is their share from the molecular expectation values of quantum\nobservables. It is demonstrated that not only the share from the average value\nof an observable may be attributed to an atomic basin, but also the fluctuation\nof each basin property is also quantifiable.\n",

Due to the weak absorption of\nwater to visible light, the first step to using solar energy to evaporate water\nis usually by converting it into thermal energy through photothermal processes\nvia additional absorbing materials. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we\nreport here strong absorption of photons in the visible spectrum at the\nwater-vapor interface by direct cleavage of water clusters via a process we\ncall photomolecular effect. We show that this process happens at the\nwater-vapor interface by measuring the dependence of the photomolecular\nevaporation rate on the wavelength, the angle of incidence, and the\npolarization of the incident light. The spectra signatures in the vapor phase\nfurther support the photomolecular effect. Despite the long propagation lengths\nof visible light in bulk water, we demonstrate that they can heat a thin layer\nof fog easily, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous. The photomolecular\neffect will have significant implications for the earth's water cycle, global\nwarming, plant transpiration, as well as different technologies involving the\nevaporation of liquids from drying to power generation\n",

The analysis\ndemonstrates that these local functionals achieve their original\nparameterization objectives to reproduce the one-PCP densities and the\nelectron-PCP correlation energies, but all fall short of reproducing the\nunderlying PCP correlation potentials correctly. Moreover, a comprehensive\nerror analysis reveals that the density-driven errors have a non-negligible\ncontribution to the success of the considered functionals.

Here, we present a toy\nmodel for controlling single-molecule diffusion by harnessing electrostatic\nforces arising from elementary surface charges within a lattice structure,\nmimicking embedded charges on a surface. We investigate the interplay between\nquantum mechanics and electrostatic interactions in single molecule diffusion\nprocesses using a combination of state-dependent diffusion equations and\nGreen's functions.

We study the use of this architecture in emulation and interpretation of\nsimulated X-ray spectroscopic data with the aim to identify key structural\ncharacteristics for the spectra, previously studied using emulator-based\ncomponent analysis (ECA). We find an EDNN to outperform ECA in covered target\nvariable variance, but also discover complications in interpreting the latent\nvariables in physical terms. As a compromise of the benefits of these two\napproaches, we develop a network where the linear projection of ECA is used,\nthus maintaining the beneficial characteristics of vector expansion from the\nlatent variables for their interpretation. These results underline the\nnecessity of information recovery after its condensation and identification of\ndecisive structural degrees of freedom for the output spectra for a justified\ninterpretation.\n",

Our results reveal that each molecule exhibits a\nwell-localized and distinctive pattern in 3D fragment-ion momentum space. We\nfind that these patterns yield direct information about the molecular\nstructures and can be qualitatively reproduced using a classical Coulomb\nexplosion simulation. Our findings suggest that laser-induced CEI can serve as\na robust method for differentiating molecular structures of organic ring and\nchain molecules. As such, it holds great promise as a method for following\nultrafast structural changes, e.g., during ring-opening reactions, by tracking\nthe motion of individual atoms in pump-probe experiments.\n",

In this work, the melting phase transitions of\n$Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $n \\leq 100$ atoms were investigated using classical\nmany-body molecular dynamics simulations. Adding a single atom to many cluster\nsizes induced strong variations in surface and core melting points, and cluster\nenergetics. Clusters with size-dependent melting behavior were classified into\n3 distinct cluster types: closed-shell, near-closed-shell, and\nfar-from-closed-shell clusters. For small clusters, near-closed-shell clusters\nhad very low surface melting points and very high melting points (heat capacity\nmaximum). Cluster sizes with symmetric closed shells and near-closed shells\nalmost always had first-order-like phase transitions. For intermediate cluster\nsizes, far-from-closed-shell clusters often exhibited second-order-like phase\ntransitions due to geometric factors. Larger cluster sizes began to favor bcc\nlattice structures. Variations in the surface and core melting behavior of\nneighboring cluster sizes may have implications for catalytic systems such as\nthe growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes.\n",

Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis\nfor clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by\nshell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range\nelectrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a\nhemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons,\nbut not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we\ndemonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \\sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the\nvicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of\nhemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure\nevaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale\nspatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell\neffects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in\nvarious fields of science and technology.\n",

Hence, particular attention has been paid to improve the fitting of\nthe forces. Interestingly, it turns out that the best fit can be obtained by\ncarefully selecting a smaller number of data points viz. 1,900 and 1,300\nconfigurations, respectively, for the two models M1 and M2. Although it was\npossible to obtain a good fit using the data of Na55 only, additional data\npoints from larger clusters were needed to get better accuracies in energies\nand forces for larger sizes. Surprisingly, the model M1 could be significantly\nimproved by adding about 50 data points per cluster from the larger sizes.
