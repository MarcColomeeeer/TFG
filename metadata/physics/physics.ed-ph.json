They must be empowered by access to resources of the physics\ncommunity and by sustained support for their professional development. To that\nend, university and college physics departments must assume an essential role\nin establishing and maintaining the necessary local infrastructure.\nNevertheless, this can be done within their current systems at negligible cost\nby forming partnerships with local alliances of inservice teachers. Practical\ndetails have been worked out, and working partnerships have been established in\nseveral localities. This effort should be extended to a national infrastructure\nfor reform of physics teaching in community colleges as well as in high\nschools. Most teachers are eager to participate in teaching reform.\n",

The potential four-momentum consisting of the potential\nmomentum and the potential energy taken together is just the gauge field of the\nassociated force times the charge associated with that force. The canonical\nmomentum is the sum of the ordinary and potential momenta. Refraction of matter\nwaves by a discontinuity in a gauge field can be used to explore the effects of\ngauge fields at an elementary level. Using this tool it is possible to show how\nthe Lorentz force law of electromagnetism follows from gauge theory. The\nresulting arguments are accessible to students at the level of the introductory\ncalculus-based physics course and tie together classical and quantum mechanics,\nrelativity, gauge theory, and electromagnetism. The resulting economy of\npresentation makes it easier to include modern physics in the one year course\nnormally available for teaching introductory physics.\n",

We describe how students can use multiple sets of resources in\ntheir thinking, and raise questions that should be considered by both\ninstructors and researchers.\n",

Here, the\nterm reasoning resources is used in a general fashion to describe any of the\nsmaller grain size models of reasoning (p-prims, facets of knowledge, intuitive\nrules, etc) rather than theoretically ambiguous (mis)conceptions. Student\napplications of reasoning resources, including one previously undocumented, are\ndescribed. Though the coordination class model is extremely helpful in\norganising the research data, problematic aspects of the model are also\ndiscussed.\n",

These particles are emitted by a\ndistant source and deflected by the gravitational field of a (opaque) star or\nof a (transparent) galaxy. The dependence of the deviation angle $D$ on the\nimpact parameter $b$, and the geometry of the (source, deflector, earth)\ntriplet, imply that different particle trajectories may reach an earth based\nobserver. Since $D(b)$ does not depend on the mass of the particles, it is\ntempting to set the particles' velocity equal to the speed of light to get a\n(Newtonian) flavor of gravitational lenses phenomena. Orders of magnitude are\nobtained through a non technical approach and can be compared to the General\nRelativity results.\n",

This influence exists even when research-based\ncurriculum materials provide implicit epistemological support.

My synthesis is\norganized around an analysis of the individual's cognition and how it interacts\nwith the environment. This leads to a two level system, a knowledge-structure\nlevel where associational patterns dominate, and a control-structure level\nwhere one can describe expectations and epistemology.

In practical terms the weight force corresponds to the gravitational\nforce. However, this gravitational definition of the weight lacks logic from\nthe perspective of present knowledge and can be misleading. In a space\ntraveling time, weight associated concepts such as \"true weight\", \"apparent\nweight\", \"weightlessness\", \"zero gravity\", \"microgravity\", are ambiguous and\nstrong deceptive. The superfluousness or ambiguousness of these concept would\nbe removed if an operational definition of the weight of a body as the force\nthe body exerts on its support or suspender is adopted. In this definition the\nweight force does not act on the body and it is not necessary to describe the\nbody's sate of motion. This avoids the imprecision of the concepts such as\n\"true weight\" and \"apparent weight\" of a body, for example. This paper\ndiscusses the need of the weight force of a body concept in Physics, and asks\nfor a re-exame of the CGPM definition to improve the physics teaching and\nlearning.\n",

A system schema\nconsists of identifying and labeling all objects of interest from a given\nphysical situation, as well as all the different types of interactions between\nthe objects. Given all the relevant objects and their interactions, students\ncan explicitly identify which are part of their system and which are not, and\nthen go on to model the interactions affecting their choice of system as either\n(i) mechanisms for energy transfer, or (ii) forces being exerted.

The detection of cosmic rays does not necessarily require\nthe use of sophisticated equipment, and various properties of the cosmic\nradiation can be observed and analysed even by the use of a single Geiger\ncounter. Nevertheless, the variety of such kind of experiments and the results\nobtained are limited because of the inclusive nature of these measurements. A\nsignificant improvement may be obtained when two or more Geiger counters are\noperated in coincidence. In this paper we discuss the potential of performing\neducational cosmic ray experiments with Geiger counters. In order to show also\nthe educational value of coincidence techniques, preliminary results of cosmic\nray experiments carried out by the use of a simple coincidence circuit are\nbriefly discussed.\n",

We present\nresults from a study designed to test this claim by developing a curriculum on\nmodels of the atom, including the Bohr and Schrodinger models. We examine\nstudent descriptions of atoms on final exams in transformed modern physics\nclasses using various versions of this curriculum. We find that if the\ncurriculum does not include sufficient connections between different models,\nmany students still have a Bohr-like view of atoms, rather than a more accurate\nSchrodinger model. However, with an improved curriculum designed to develop\nmodel-building skills and with better integration between different models, it\nis possible to get most students to describe atoms using the Schrodinger model.\nIn comparing our results with previous research, we find that comparing and\ncontrasting different models is a key feature of a curriculum that helps\nstudents move beyond the Bohr model and adopt Schrodinger's view of the atom.\nWe find that understanding the reasons for the development of models is much\nmore difficult for students than understanding the features of the models.

        "summary": "  Even though there has been a tremendous amount of research done in how to\nhelp students learn physics, students are still coming away missing a crucial\npiece of the puzzle: why bother with physics? Students learn fundamental laws\nand how to calculate, but come out of a general physics course without a deep\nunderstanding of how physics has transformed the world around them. In other\nwords, they get the \"how\" but not the \"why\". Studies have shown that students\nleave introductory physics courses almost universally with decreased\nexpectations and with a more negative attitude. This paper will detail an\nexperiment to address this problem: a course weblog or \"blog\" which discusses\nreal-world applications of physics and engages students in discussion and\nthinking outside of class. Specifically, students' attitudes towards the value\nof physics and its applicability to the real-world were probed using a\n26-question Likert scale survey over the course of four semesters in an\nintroductory physics course at a comprehensive Jesuit university. We found that\nstudents who did not participate in the blog study generally exhibited a\ndeterioration in attitude towards physics as seen previously. However, students\nwho read, commented, and were involved with the blog maintained their initially\npositive attitudes towards physics. Student response to the blog was\noverwhelmingly positive, with students claiming that the blog made the things\nwe studied in the classroom come alive for them and seem much more relevant.\n",

To promote one\nontological description in physics instruction, as suggested by Slotta and Chi,\ncould undermine novices' access to productive cognitive resources they bring to\ntheir studies and inhibit their transition to the dynamic ontological\nflexibility required of experts.\n",

We analyze students' verbal\nreasoning during several tutorial sessions using the framework of Russ, and\nfind a strong correlation between certain behavioral modes and the scientific\nquality of students' explanations. We suggest that this is due to a dynamic\ncoupling of how students behave, how they frame an activity, and how they\nreason during that activity. This analysis supports the earlier claims of a\ndynamic between behavior and epistemology. We discuss implications for research\nand instruction.\n",

For students to develop their ability to\nsolve ill-structured problems, they must first believe that standardized\nprocedural approaches will not always be sufficient for solving ill-structured\nengineering and scientific challenges. In this paper we document the range of\nbeliefs university students have about problem-solving. Students enrolled in a\nphysics course submitted a written reflection both at the start and the end of\nthe course on how they solve problems. We coded approximately 500 of these\nreflections for the presence of different problem-solving approaches. At the\nstart of the semester over 50% of the students mention in written reflections\nthat they use Rolodex equation matching, i.e. they solve problems by searching\nfor equations that have the same variables as the knowns and unknowns. We then\ndescribe the extent to which students' beliefs about physics problem-solving\nchange due to their experience throughout a semester with context-rich,\nmultifaceted problems. The frequency of strategies such as the Rolodex method\nreduces only slightly by the end of the semester. However, there is an increase\nin students describing more expansive strategies within their reflections. In\nparticular there is a large increase in describing the use of diagrams, and\nthinking about concepts first. Hence the use of context-rich, multi-faceted\nproblems positively impacts students' attitude towards problem-solving.\n",

This enhanced MC question allows as many as ten\nanswers. The answers can vary in their degree of correctness and can be\nassigned partial credit. By combining wireless keypads and multiple-choice\nquestions, we can readily perform both formative and summative assessments of\nstudent learning. Examples and classroom applications are presented.\n",

These experiments allow many variations, e.g.\npendulum bobs can have different shapes, threads can be tied to a hook at their\nedge or pass through their centre of mass, they can be hanged as simple or\nbifilar pendulums. In these many variations, they emphasize the difference\nbetween theory and practice in the passage from an idealized scheme to a real\nexperimental asset, which becomes evident, for example, when the pendulum bob\ncannot be considered an idealized point mass. Moreover, they require careful\nobservation of details such as the type of thread used and its rigidity or the\nbob initial slant, which leads to different behaviors. Their mathematical\nmodels require a wide range of fundamental topics in experimental data\nanalysis: arithmetic and weighted mean, standard deviation, central limit\ntheorem application, data distribution, and the significant difference between\ntheory and practice. Setting the mass-spring experiment immediately after the\npendulum highlights the question of resonance, revises the gap between theory\nand practice in another context, and provides another occasion to practice\nfurther techniques in data analysis.\n",

At each university, post-instruction\nBEMA test averages were significantly higher for the M&I curriculum than for\nthe traditional curriculum.

The results suggest that the\nM&I curriculum is more effective than the traditional curriculum at teaching\nE&M concepts to students, possibly because the learning progression in M&I\nreorganizes and augments the traditional sequence of topics, for example, by\nincreasing early emphasis on the vector field concept and by emphasizing the\neffects of fields on matter at the microscopic level.\n",

We find correlations of roughly 0.35 to\n0.5 between SAT scores and upper division, in-major GPA (henceforth, GPA).\nInterestingly, low SAT scores do not preclude high performance in most majors.\nThat is, the distribution of SAT scores after conditioning on high GPA (e.g.,\n3.5 or even 4.0) typically extends below 1000 (the average among test takers).\nWe hypothesize that \"overachievers\" overcome cognitive deficits through hard\nwork, and discuss to what extent they can be identified from high school\nrecords. Only a few majors seem to exhibit a \"cognitive threshold\" -- such that\nhigh GPA (mastery of the subject matter) is very unlikely below a certain SAT\nthreshold (i.e., no matter how dedicated or hard working the student). Our\nresults suggest that almost any student admitted to university can achieve\nacademic success, if they work hard enough. In addition to our primary result,\nwe find that the best predictor of GPA is a roughly equally weighted sum of SAT\nand high school GPA, measured in standard deviation units. Using a\nsub-population of honors college students, we can estimate how students at\nelite universities would fare at a typical state university, allowing us to\ncomment on issues such as grade inflation. Finally, we observe that 1) SAT\nscores fluctuate little on retest (very high reliability), 2) SAT and GRE\nscores (where available) correlate at roughly 0.75 (consistent with the notion\nthat both tests measure a stable general cognitive ability) and 3) the SAT\ndistribution of students that obtained a degree does not differ substantially\nfrom that of the entering class.\n",

The validity of Hooke's law for\nthe system and the relationship between the spring constant of the segments\nwith the spring constant of the entire spring is verified experimentally.

It incorporates role playing in\nthe inspiring environment of an astronomical observatory. In this activity\nstellar constellations with their myths and history pose an ideal opportunity\nto explore global citizenship. Students not only place themselves in someone\nelse's situation, but also compare their different reactions when faced with a\ncommon situation. This idea is extended to analyse the change in constellation\nculture throughout time and the affect politics has had on constellations. In\nthis article we outline the details of this activity and how it deals with\ncommon astronomical misconceptions. We also demonstrate its implementation into\nastronomy taught at schools.

We make the case that problem-solving expertise\nshould include opportunistically blending conceptual and formal mathematical\nreasoning even while manipulating equations. We present analysis of interviews\nwith two students, Alex and Pat. Interviewed students were asked to explain a\nparticular equation and solve a problem using that equation.

His shortcut blended mathematical operations\nwith conceptual reasoning about physical processes, reflecting a view -\nexpressed earlier in his explanation of the equation - that equations can\nexpress an overarching conceptual meaning. Using case studies of Alex and Pat,\nwe argue that this opportunistic blending of conceptual and formal mathematical\nreasoning (i) is a part of problem-solving expertise, (ii) can be described in\nterms of cognitive elements called symbolic forms (Sherin, 2001), and (iii) is\na feasible instructional target.\n",

Given that student expectations influence the ways in whichthey\nparticipate in course activities, this paper (the first in a series that looks\nat student expectations in biology) argues that curriculum reform initiatives\nshould consider student expectations in order to increase the chance for\neffective implementation.\n",

The topic is divided into\nsuitably chosen concept categories. A large number of True/False questions are\nprepared for each concept category, which can be answered using the concepts in\nthat category. The module presents seven randomly chosen questions from each of\nthe concept categories. Only when each of the questions from a concept category\nis answered correctly, will it be inferred that the concept category has been\nunderstood properly. A diagnostic module based on this approach can reliably\nand efficiently identify the conceptual deficiencies. After taking remedial\nmeasures, the student can take the diagnostic test again till all conceptual\ndeficiencies are removed\n",

Fluid mechanics at EBI\nwas considered by students as difficult who seemed somewhat unmotivated. In\norder to motivate them, we applied a new play-based pedagogy. Students were\nasked to draw inspiration from everyday life situations to find applications of\nfluid mechanics and to do experiments to verify and validate some theoretical\nresults obtained in course. In this paper, we present an innovative\nteaching/learning pedagogy which includes the concept of learning through play\nand its implications in fluid mechanics for engineering. Examples of atypical\nexperiments in fluid mechanics made by students are presented. Based on\nteaching evaluation by students, it is possible to know how students feel the\ncourse. The effectiveness of this approach to motivate students is presented\nthrough an analysis of students' teaching assessment. Learning through play\nproved a great success in fluid mechanics where course evaluations increased\nsubstantially. Fluid mechanics has been progressively perceived as interesting,\nuseful, pleasant and easy to assimilate. It is shown that this pedagogy which\nincludes educational gaming presents benefits for students. These experiments\nseem therefore to be a very effective tool for improving teaching/learning\nactivities in higher education.\n",

The majority of non-STEM\nstudents can be classified as either concrete operational or transitional\nreasoners in Piaget's theory of cognitive development, whereas in the STEM\npopulation formal operational reasoners are far more prevalent. In particular,\nnon-STEM students demonstrate significant difficulty with proportional and\nhypothetico-deductive reasoning. Pre-scores on the LCTSR are correlated with\nnormalized learning gains on various concept inventories. The correlation is\nstrongest for content that can be categorized as mostly theoretical, meaning a\nlack of directly observable exemplars, and weakest for content categorized as\nmostly descriptive, where directly observable exemplars are abundant. Although\nthe implementation of research-verified, interactive engagement pedagogy can\nlead to gains in content knowledge, significant gains in theoretical content\n(such as force and energy) are more difficult with non-STEM students. We also\nobserve no significant gains on the LCTSR without explicit instruction in\nscientific reasoning patterns.

The model calculation implies the\ndivision of the whole system into two subsystems of variable mass, allowing to\nexplore the role of tensional contact forces at the boundary of the subsystems.\nThis justifies, for instance, that the folded U-chain falls faster than the\nacceleration due to the gravitational force. This result, which matches quite\nwell with the experimental data independently of the type of chain, implies\nthat the falling chain is well described by energy conservation. We verify that\nthese conclusions are not observed for the pile-chain motion.\n",

        "summary": "  In classical physics, the familiar sine and cosine functions appear in two\nforms: (1) geometrical, in the treatment of vectors such as forces and\nvelocities, and (2) differential, as solutions of oscillation and wave\nequations. These two forms correspond to two different definitions of\ntrigonometric functions, one geometrical using right triangles and unit\ncircles, and the other employing differential equations. Although the two\ndefinitions must be equivalent, this equivalence is not demonstrated in\ntextbooks. In this manuscript, the equivalence between the geometrical and the\ndifferential definition is presented assuming no a priori knowledge of the\nproperties of sine and cosine functions. We start with the usual length\nprojections on the unit circle and use elementary geometry and elementary\ncalculus to arrive to harmonic differential equations. This more general and\nabstract treatment not only reveals the equivalence of the two definitions but\nalso provides an instructive perspective on circular and harmonic motion as\nstudied in kinematics. This exercise can help develop an appreciation of\nabstract thinking in physics.\n",

The AO Summer\nSchool (AOSS), sponsored by the Center for Adaptive Optics, is a week-long\ncourse for training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the\nunderlying theory, design, and use of AO systems. AOSS participants include\nastronomers who expect to utilize AO data, vision scientists who will use AO\ninstruments to conduct research, opticians and engineers who design AO systems,\nand users of high-bandwidth laser communication systems.\n  In this article we describe new AOSS laboratory sessions implemented in\n2006-2009 for nearly 250 students. The activity goals include boosting\nfamiliarity with AO technologies, reinforcing knowledge of optical alignment\ntechniques and the design of optical systems, and encouraging inquiry into\ncritical scientific questions in vision science using AO systems as a research\ntool. The activities are divided into three stations: Vision Science, Fourier\nOptics, and the AO Demonstrator. We briefly overview these activities, which\nare described fully in other articles in these conference proceedings (Putnam\net al., Do et al., and Harrington et al., respectively).\n  We devote attention to the unique challenges encountered in the design of\nthese activities, including the marriage of inquiry-like investigation\ntechniques with complex content and the need to tune depth to a graduate- and\nPhD-level audience. According to before-after surveys conducted in 2008, the\nvast majority of participants found that all activities were valuable to their\ncareers, although direct experience with integrated, functional AO systems was\nparticularly beneficial.\n",

Introductory physics courses are generally the\nfirst courses in which students learn to create models to solve complex\nproblems. However, many students taking introductory physics courses fail to\nacquire a command of the concepts, methods and tools presented in these\ncourses. The reforms proposed by this thesis focus on altering the content of\nintroductory courses rather than content delivery methods as most reforms do.\n  This thesis explores how the performance on a widely used test of conceptual\nunderstanding in mechanics compares between students taking a course with\nupdated and modified content and students taking a traditional course. Better\nperformance by traditional students was found to stem from their additional\npractice on the types of items which appeared on the test. The results of this\nwork brought into question the role of the introductory physics course for\nnon-majors.\n  One aspect of this new role is the teaching of new methods such as\ncomputation (the use of a computer to solve numerically, simulate and visualize\nphysical problems). This thesis explores the potential benefits for students\nwho learn computation as part of physics course. After students worked through\na suite of computational homework problems, many were able to model a new\nphysical situation with which they had no experience.\n  The failure of some students to model this new situation might have stemmed\nfrom their unfavorable attitudes towards learning computation. In this thesis,\nwe present the development of a new tool for characterizing students'\nattitudes. Preliminary measurements indicated significant differences between\nsuccessful and unsuccessful students.\n",

We apply these methods to\nan introductory physics (mechanics) problem categorization experiment, and find\nthat most of the variation in sorting outcome is not due to the sorter being an\nexpert versus a novice, but rather due to an independent characteristic that we\nnamed \"stacker\" versus \"spreader.\" The fact that the expert-novice distinction\nonly accounts for a smaller amount of the variation may explain the frequent\nnull-results when conducting these experiments.\n",

The central\nfeature of this course is a focus on sense-making by the students during the\nfive hours per week discussion/labs in which the students take part in\nactivities emphasizing peer-peer discussions, argumentation, and presentations\nof ideas. The course differs in many fundamental ways from traditionally taught\nintroductory physics courses. After discussing the unique features of CLASP and\nits implementation at UC Davis, various student outcome measures are presented\nshowing increased performance by students who took the CLASP course compared to\nstudents who took a traditionally taught introductory physics course. Measures\nwe use include upper-division GPAs, MCAT scores, FCI gains, and MPEX-II scores.\n",

We aim to engage high school educators to professionally develop\nthemselves by creating and customizing simulations possible through Easy Java\nSimulation (Ejs) and its learning community. Ejs allows educators to be\ndesigners of learning environments through modifying source codes of the\nsimulation. Educators can conduct lessons with students' using these\ninteractive digital simulations and rapidly enhance the simulation through\nchanging the source codes personally. Ejs toolkit, its library of simulations\nand growing community contributed simulation codes, in a Web 2.0 environment,\npotentially allows for rapid proliferation of mass customized virtual\nlaboratories simulation with educators as designers of learning environment.\nOur journey of remixing this simulation created an educator customized\ninteractive digital media virtual laboratory for advancing learning physics by\ninquiry. The process of creating a simulation also has desirable pedagogical\nvalue that will be challenging to bring to high school students to learn by\nmodeling.The impediments to using this method are discussed.\n",

In the Spring quarter of 2012, UC Davis offered\n4 sections (about 180 students each) of the first quarter of introductory\nphysics, Physics 9A, covering Newtonian mechanics. One of these sections is a\n\"treatment\" group and had the entire 10-week quarter's set of ideas introduced,\nlargely qualitatively, in the first 6 weeks followed by the 4 weeks where\nstudents learn to use those ideas to solve the algebraically complicated\nproblems that physicists prize. The other three sections were organized as\nusual. The treatment group and one of the other sections were taught by the\nauthor and were identical (same homework, discussion, lecture, and lab) except\nfor the organization of the content. After controlling for GPA as well as Force\nConcept Inventory pretest scores, the treatment group was found, with better\nthan 99% confidence, to score higher on the final exam. Some curricular details\nof the treatment class are discussed in this paper.\n",

In a \"Student Assessment of their Learning Gains\" (SALG) survey,\nstudents identified this approach as producing \"great gains\" in their\nunderstanding of real world problems and scientific research. Using the marble\ngame, students build a conceptual framework that applies directly to random\nmolecular-level processes in biology such as diffusion and interfacial\ntransport. It is also isomorphic with a reversible first-order chemical\nreaction providing conceptual preparation for chemical kinetics. The\ncomputational and mathematical framework can also be applied to investigate the\npredictions of quantitative physics models ranging from Newtonian mechanics\nthrough RLC circuits. To test this approach, students were asked to derive a\nnovel theory of osmosis. The test results confirm that they were able to\nsuccessfully apply the conceptual framework to a new situation under final exam\nconditions. The marble game thus provides a pathway to the STEM disciplines\nthat includes quantitative biology concepts in the undergraduate curriculum -\nfrom the very first class.\n",

In each case, we see differences in how the two disciplines frame and\nsee value in the tasks.

The main\nconsequences are limited achievements in school, decrease of students'\ninterests in learning physics and decrease of enrolments in physics in many\ncountries. In recent years, the decline in enrolments was faced up with the\nlaunch of a wide national project addressed to secondary school students and\nteachers.

We describe some advanced courses in\nPhysics and Mathematics Education realized few years ago and courses designed\nfor a Master in Physics Educational Innovation and Orienting performed jointly\nby many Italian universities. Other activities are less formal but equally\nrelevant, such as the active involvement of expert, young and in training\nteachers in designing and implementation of laboratory activities for a summer\nschool of physics. Recently, we developed a workshop for teachers of physics\nand mathematics on modelling. which continued in an updating course for\nteachers in which selected topics, named in the same way in both disciplines,\nwere discussed in order to design interdisciplinary learning paths.

The teachers build a sophisticated explanation for why objects of\ndifferent masses have the same acceleration due to gravity, starting from\nsubstance-based metaphors for gravity.

In our analysis, we plot exam\nscores versus homework completion scores and calculate the slopes of the line\nfits and the Pearson correlations. On average, completing many homework\nproblems correlated to better exam scores only for students with high physics\naptitude. Low aptitude physics students had a negative correlation between exam\nperformance and completing homework; the more homework problems they did, the\nworse their performance was on exams. One explanation for this effect is that\nthe assigned homework problems placed an excessive cognitive load on low\naptitude students. As a result, no learning or even negative learning might\nhave taken place when low aptitude students attempted to do assigned homework.\nAnother explanation is based on the fact that the negative benefit effects\nfirst appeared when magnetism concepts were introduced. According to this\nexplanation, low aptitude students had difficulty consolidating knowledge of\nmagnetic fields with previously-learned knowledge of electric fields. A third\npossibility, that a high homework copying rate by low aptitude students impeded\nlearning, is rejected because two different analyses revealed no evidence of\nhomework copying.\n",

Students completed nearly 20% more\nhomework when their average perception of homework increased by 0.5 points on a\n4-point Likert scale.

        "summary": "  We review the literature on the gender gap on concept inventories in physics.\nAcross studies of the most commonly used mechanics concept inventories, the\nForce Concept Inventory (FCI) and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation\n(FMCE), mens average pretest scores are always higher than womens, and in most\ncases mens posttest scores are higher as well. The weighted average gender\ndifference on these tests is 13% for pretest scores, 12% for posttest scores,\nand 6% for normalized gain. This difference is much smaller than the average\ndifference in normalized gain between traditional lecture and interactive\nengagement (25%), but it is large enough that it could impact the results of\nstudies comparing the effectiveness of different teaching methods. There is\nsometimes a gender gap on commonly used electromagnetism concept inventories,\nbut it is usually much smaller and sometimes is zero or favors women. The\nweighted average gender difference on these tests is 3.7% for pretest scores,\n8.5% for posttest scores, and 6% for normalized gain. Based on our analysis of\n26 published articles, no single factor is sufficient to explain the gap.\nSeveral high-profile studies that have claimed to account for or reduce the\ngender gap have failed to be replicated in subsequent studies, suggesting that\nisolated claims of explanations of the gender gap should be interpreted with\ncaution. Other factors, such as gender differences in background preparation,\nscores on different kinds of assessment, and splits between how students\nrespond to test questions when answering for themselves or for a scientist do\ncontribute to a difference between male and female responses, but the size of\nthese differences is smaller than the size of the overall gender gap,\nsuggesting that the gender gap is most likely due to the combination of many\nsmall factors rather than any one factor that can easily be modified.\n",

However, we claim that our interdisciplinary setting (a\nphysics class that builds deep connections to biology and chemistry) leads to a\ndifferent set of considerations and conclusions. In a course designed to draw\ninterdisciplinary connections, the centrality of chemical bond energy in\nbiology necessitates foregrounding negative energy from the beginning.

More than three-quarters of questions fall into categories\nbeyond simple recall, in contrast to similar studies of student-authored\ncontent in different subject domains. Similarly, the quality of\nstudent-authored explanations for questions was also high, with approximately\n60% of all explanations classified as being of high or outstanding quality.\nOverall, 75% of questions met combined quality criteria, which we hypothesize\nis due in part to the in-class scaffolding activities that we provided for\nstudents ahead of requiring them to author questions.\n",

        "summary": "  There is general agreement that creativity and innovation are desirable\ntraits in the toolbox of 21\\textsuperscript{st} century engineers, as well as\nin the future workforce in general. However, there is a dearth of exemplars,\npedagogical models, or best practices to be implemented in undergraduate\nengineering education to develop and nurture those talents. In this paper, we\nuse a specific example of a classroom activity from a course designed to help\nbridge the transition from learning the fundamental principles of engineering\nphysics in introductory courses to being able to creatively and innovatively\napply them in more advanced settings, such as senior capstone projects and\non-the-job challenges in the future workplace. Application of techniques for\ngenerating and evaluating ideas are described. To enhance the benefits of group\ncreativity and facilitate real-time electronic brainstorming in the classroom,\nwe use InkSurvey with pen-enabled mobile computing devices (iPads, tablet PCs,\nAndroid devices, etc.). Using this free, web-based software in this setting\neffectively mitigates many of the social issues that typically plague\nbrainstorming in a group setting. The focus, instead, is on paying attention to\nthe ideas of others while encouraging fluency, originality, and honing positive\ncritical thinking skills. This emphasis is reflected as the group creates a\nmetric to evaluate their potential solutions. A specific case from\nundergraduate and graduate level engineering physics courses is described to\nillustrate how the extensive work done in this arena in psychology, marketing,\nand business environments can be applied to STEM education. The classroom\nprocess is outlined and actual student results are presented to illustrate the\nmethod for other instructors who might be interested in employing similar\nactivities in a non-threatening, low-stakes learning environment.\n",

These efforts are complicated by\nthe many apparent differences between these fields, including the types of\nsystems that each studies, the behavior of those systems, the kinds of\nmeasurements that each makes, and the role of mathematics in each field.\nNonetheless, physics and biology are both sciences that rely on observations\nand measurements to construct models of the natural world. In the present\ntheoretical article, we propose that efforts to bridge the teaching of these\ntwo disciplines must emphasize shared scientific practices, particularly\nscientific modeling. We define modeling using language common to both\ndisciplines and highlight how an understanding of the modeling process can help\nreconcile apparent differences between the teaching of physics and biology. We\nelaborate how models can be used for explanatory, predictive, and functional\npurposes and present common models from each discipline demonstrating key\nmodeling principles.

Thus, there is a need to explore ways in\nwhich MC questions can be utilized pedagogically more like CR questions while\nmaintaining their attendant procedural advantages. we describe how an\nanswer-until-correct MC response format allows for the construction of\nmultiple-choice examinations designed to operate much as a hybrid between\nstandard MC and CR testing. With this tool - the immediate feedback assessment\ntechnique (IF-AT) - students gain complete knowledge of the correct answer for\neach question during the examination, and can use such information for solving\nsubsequent test items. This feature allows for the creation of a new type of\ncontext-dependent item sets; the \"integrated testlet\". In an integrated testlet\ncertain items are purposefully inter-dependent and are thus presented in a\nparticular order. Such integrated testlets represent a proxy of typical CR\nquestions, but with a straightforward and uniform marking scheme that also\nallows for granting partial credit for proximal knowledge. We present a case\nstudy of an IF-AT-scored midterm and final examination for an introductory\nphysics course, and discuss specific testlets with varying degrees of\nintegration. In total, the items are found to allow for excellent\ndiscrimination, with a mean item-total correlation measure for the combined 45\nitems of the two examinations of $\\bar{r}'=0.41\\pm 0.13$ (mean $\\pm$ standard\ndeviation) and a final examination test reliability of $\\alpha=0.82$ ($n=25$\nitems).

A model to represent and to analyse the dynamics of river lock\noperation is presented and we derive the dynamical equations for the rising of\nthe water column as an example to understand the Euler equation. Furthermore,\nwith this activity, we enable the integration of content initially introduced\nin the classroom with practical applications, thereby allowing the association\nof physical themes to content relevant in disciplines such as history and\ngeography. In addition, experiences of this kind enable teachers to talk about\nthe environmental and social impacts caused by the construction of a dam and,\nconsequently, a crossover of concepts has been made possible, leading to more\nmeaningful learning for the students.\n",

Built on public-private cloud\ncomputing infrastructure, PR served nearly 1000 students during Fall 2012 term,\ndelivering more than 60,000 problem pages. The service complements that of\ncommercial publishing houses by offering problems authored by local professors.\nWe describe the service architecture, including reporting and analytical\ncapabilities, and present an initial evaluation of the impact of its use. Among\nroughly 500 students studying electromagnetism, we find that the 229 students\nwho worked fifty or more problems over the term outperformed their complement\nby 0.40 grade points (on a 4.0 scale). This improvement partly reflects a\nselection bias that better students used the service more frequently. Adjusting\nfor this selection bias by using overall grade point average (GPA) as a\nclassifier, we find a grade point improvement of 0.22 for regular PR users,\nsignificantly above the random noise level of 0.04. Simply put, students who\nworked one or more additional problem per weekday earned nearly a\nquarter-letter average grade improvement irrespective of GPA. Student comments\nemphasize the importance of randomness in helping them synthesize concepts. The\nPR source code is publicly available on the bitbucket repository.\n",

In an effort to develop learning goals\nthat support teachers in building robust understandings of energy from their\nexisting knowledge, we studied teachers' impromptu conversations about these\ntopics during professional development courses about energy. Many of these\nteachers' ideas appear to align with statements from the NGSS, including the\nintuition that energy can be present but inaccessible, that energy can change\nin its usefulness as it transforms within a system, and that energy can lose\nits usefulness as it disperses, often ending up as thermal energy. Some\nteachers' ideas about energy degradation go beyond what is articulated in the\nNGSS, including the idea that thermal energy can be useful in some situations\nand the idea that energy's usefulness depends on the objects included in a\nscenario. Based on these observations, we introduce learning goals for energy\ndegradation and the second law of thermodynamics that (1) represent a\nsophisticated physics understanding of these concepts, (2) originate in ideas\nthat teachers already use, and (3) align with the NGSS.\n",

In our analysis, we argue that Multiple Linear Regression\nmodeling is superior to other common analysis tools, including normalized gain.\nOur results show that ILS are effective at improving student learning by all\nmeasures used: research-validated concept inventories and final exam scores, on\nboth conceptual and traditional problem-solving questions. Multiple Linear\nRegression analysis reveals that interactivity in the classroom is a\nsignificant predictor of student learning, showing a similar or stronger\nrelationship with student learning than such ascribed characteristics as\nparents' education, and achieved characteristics such as GPA and hours studied\nper week.

To measure learning in physics by high school students,\neither qualitatively or quantitatively, is a process in which it should be\npossible to identify not only the concepts and contents students failed to\nachieve but also the reasons of the failure. We propose that students' video\nproduction offers a very effective formative assessment to teachers: as a\nformative assessment, it produces information that allows the understanding of\nwhere and when the learning process succeeded or failed, of identifying, as a\nsubject or as a group, the defficiencies or misunderstandings related to the\ntheme under analysis and their interpretation by students, and it provides also\na different kind of assessment, related to some other life skills, like the\nability to carry a project to its conclusion and to work cooperatively. In this\npaper, we describe the use of videos produced by high school students as an\nassessment resource. The students were asked to prepare a short video, which\nwas then presented to the whole group and discussed. The videos reveal aspects\nof students' difficulties that usually do not appear in formal assessments such\nas tests and questionnaires. After the use of the videos as an component of\nclassroom assessments and the use of the discussions to rethink learning\nactivities in the group, the videos were analysed and classified in various\ncategories. This analysis showed a strong correlation between the technical\nquality of the video and the content quality of the students argumentation.\nAlso, it was shown that the students don't prepare their video based on quick\nand easy production, they usually choose forms of video production that require\ncareful planning and implementation, and this reflects directly on the overall\nquality of the video and of the learning process.\n",

It has been noted that strategies adopted for the assessment of what\nstudents learn and develop through a laboratory course are often inconsistent\nwith the objectives of the laboratory courses. The author has developed a\ncomprehensive assessment strategy which can be used at the school, college and\nuniversity level. The strategy is based on four tools of assessment, namely,\ntest on conceptual understanding, test on procedural understanding, an\nexperimental test, and the continuous assessment. The relative weightage for\neach of the four tools depends on the level and emphasis of the laboratory\ncourse. The four tools of assessment, with respect to the type of questions,\ndesign, grading schemes, administration of each tool have been described with a\nfew sample questions for each tool of assessment. This assessment strategy is\nbeing practiced and its effectiveness studied during a series of special\ncourses in experimental physics in India. Furthermore, a survey was carried out\nwith university teachers from across India to check the acceptability and\nfeasibility of using this strategy for larger number of students in\nuniversities and most of the participating teachers supported the use of this\nstrategy.\n",

In most of the Indian colleges and\nuniversities (and probably at many other places all over the world) the usual\npractice of performing a set of experiments, in a cook-book mode, seldom helps\nstudents achieve the objectives of the physics laboratory courses and develop\nthe abilities and skills required to become a successful experimental\nphysicist. This paper describes the details of an instructional approach\ndesigned and being followed by the author for a past few years, to encourage\nstudents independent thinking in the physics laboratory. This instructional\napproach encourages students active participation, independent thinking and\noffers an opportunity to learn how to think scientifically during traditional\nphysics laboratory courses without major curriculum and content changes. Here,\nguided problem solving approach is adopted by combining problem-solving and\nguided design modes of instruction. In this approach an experiment is presented\nas an experimental problem with well thought procedural instructions. During a\ntypical laboratory session, first an introductory demonstration is presented to\neach group of a few students separately for the first twenty minutes by the\nmentors as a prelude to the problem and the remaining laboratory time is made\navailable for students to independently solve the experimental problem. The\npaper also illustrates the approach by describing a familiar experimental\nproblem and the demonstration on Electromagnetic damping with some details of\nthe experimental arrangement, which is being used by the author for training of\nstudents and teachers at the introductory university level.\n",

While recent work\non ontological metaphors for energy has emphasized the affordances of the\nsubstance ontology, this ontology is problematic in the context of negative\nenergy. Instead, we apply a dynamic ontologies perspective to argue that\nblending the substance and location ontologies for energy can be effective in\nreasoning about negative energy in the context of reasoning about chemical\nbonds. We present data from an introductory physics for the life sciences\n(IPLS) course in which both experts and students successfully use this blended\nontology.

A simple experiment using six\ntypes of granules consistently confirmed the theoretical predictions. We showed\nthat the critical angle is independent of the size distribution of the\ngranules. We observed that the sliding angle of granules inside the cylinder is\nconstant and, surprisingly, similar to the avalanche angle of the granules. Our\ntheoretical prediction can be used to determine the critical angle without\nconsidering the shape, surface roughness and size distribution of the granules.\nAdditionally, we derived the oscillation frequency of the system when it is\nslightly deviated from equilibrium, showing the frequency initially increases\nand then decreases with increasing granular volume. The oscillation is absent\nwhen the cylinder is empty or fully filled with granules. Furthermore, the\ndissipation of energy as a function of the fractional volume and fractional\nmass of the cylinder system were determined.

In the first part of this paper, we\ndescribe a laboratory experiment aimed at beginner students which also gives\nthose with a more advanced background an opportunity to explore more complex\naspects of the motions involved. If students are not given predefined apparatus\nbut are allowed instead to design their own set-up for the experiment, they may\nalso learn something about the thought processes and experimental procedures\nused in physics. In the second part of this paper, we present a systematic\nstudy of the parametric behavior of the system because teachers have to master\nits dynamics. The non-linear interaction between the vertical and the pendular\noscillations in a vertical spring-mass system depends on the ratio between the\nfrequencies of the two motions and on the motion's excitation. Systematic\nexperimental investigations, coupled with relevant simulations, highlight the\nmany aspects of physics involved in the partition of energy transfer between\nthe two modes. The different motion waveforms obtained by sweeping through the\nresonance curve and by applying small and strong excitations are presented and\nanalyzed. The influence of the unavoidable spurious motions is investigated. An\nanalogy between the parametric interaction in a spring--mass system and that\nfound during frequency conversion in non-linear optical crystals is discussed.\n",

Nor do\nthey recognize the implications of the millions of years of history of life on\nearth in which humans are the latest edition of learning organisms. The\ncontemporary educational paradigm of \"education for all\" is based on a 17th\ncentury model of \"printing minds\" for passing on static knowledge. This\ncharacterizes most of K-12 education. In contrast, 21st Century education\ndemands a new paradigm, which we call Ergonomic Education. This is an education\nsystem that is designed to fit the students of any age instead of forcing the\nstudents to fit the education system. It takes into account in a fundamental\nway what students want to learn -- the concept \"wanting to learn\" refers to the\ninnate ability and desire to learn that is characteristic of humans.

Therefore, instructors need to be informed of the impacts\nof introducing cognitive conflicts during teaching. To get this information,\nteachers need a practical instrument that can help them identify the existence\nand features of cognitive conflict introduced by the instruction and the\nresulting anxiety. Based on the literature on studies of cognitive conflict and\nstudent anxiety, a quantitative instrument, the In-class Conflict and Anxiety\nRecognition Evaluation (iCARE), was developed and used to monitor the status of\nstudents' cognitive conflict and anxiety in the Physics by Inquiry (PBI)\nclasses.

(2) When do physics majors\ndevelop expert-like beliefs? and (3) How do students' beliefs impact their\nlearning of physics? We report that in typical physics classes, students'\nbeliefs deteriorate or at best stay the same. There are a few types of\ninterventions, including an explicit focus on model-building and/or developing\nexpert- like beliefs that lead to significant improvements in beliefs. Further,\nsmall courses and those for elementary education and non-science majors also\nresult in improved beliefs. However, because the available data oversamples\ncertain types of classes, it is unclear whether these improvements are actually\ndue to the interventions, or due to the small class size, or student population\ntypical of the kinds of classes in which these interventions are most often\nused. Physics majors tend to enter their undergraduate education with more\nexpert-like beliefs than non-majors and these beliefs remain relatively stable\nthroughout their undergraduate careers. Thus, typical physics courses appear to\nbe selecting students who already have strong beliefs, rather than supporting\nstudents in developing strong beliefs. There is a small correlation between\nstudents' incoming beliefs about physics and their gains on conceptual\nmechanics surveys. This suggests that students with more expert-like incoming\nbeliefs may learn more in their physics courses, but this finding should be\nfurther explored and replicated. Some unanswered questions remain. To answer\nthese questions, we advocate several specific types of future studies.\n",

User-modifiable simulations in Ruby and Ruby\non Rails are presented, along with simulation results for various combinations\nof conductors. Results are interpreted in terms of the Principle of Least Time,\nillustrating a powerful unification in physics between disparate areas such as\noptics and thermodynamics.\n",

However, because of time, cost, and scoring reliability\nconstraints associated with this format, CR questions are being increasingly\nreplaced by multiple-choice (MC) questions in formal exams. The integrated\ntestlet (IT) is a recently-developed question structure designed to provide a\nproxy of the pedagogical advantages of CR questions while procedurally\nfunctioning as set of MC questions. ITs utilize an answer-until-correct\nresponse format that provides immediate confirmatory or corrective feedback,\nand they thus allow not only for the granting of partial credit in cases of\ninitially incorrect reasoning, but furthermore the ability to build cumulative\nquestion structures. Here, we report on a study that directly compares the\nfunctionality of ITs and CR questions in introductory physics exams. To do\nthis, CR questions were converted to concept-equivalent ITs, and both sets of\nquestions were deployed in midterm and final exams. We find that both question\ntypes provide adequate discrimination between stronger and weaker students,\nwith CR questions discriminating slightly better than the ITs. Meanwhile, an\nanalysis of inter-rater scoring of the CR questions raises serious concerns\nabout the reliability of the granting of partial credit when this traditional\nassessment technique is used in a realistic (but non optimized) setting.\nFurthermore, we show evidence that partial credit is granted in a valid manner\nin the ITs. Thus, together with consideration of the vastly reduced costs of\nadministering IT-based examinations compared to CR-based examinations, our\nfindings indicate that ITs are viable replacements for CR questions in formal\nexaminations where it is desirable to both assess concept integration and to\nreward partial knowledge, while efficiently scoring examinations.\n",

The animation is based on the\noblique motion model and we have described the movement qualitatively, showing\nchanges in the trajectory of an object as we modify the control parameters,\nsuch as speed and launch angle. Exploring the software graphical tools, the\nconsistency between the results obtained by the animation and the literature is\nmaintained, for example the maximum height and the rise time of the disc. This\ntool can be applied to students from different education levels, and also to\nundergraduate and high school students.\n",

In this proposal, we explain the three-tier structure; we comment\non it's application to undergraduate students from two semestral courses, and\nwe analyze the category spectrum that a three-tier test produces, discussing\nit's differences with a traditional multiple choice question, it's limitations,\nand possible new applications.\n",

Despite much research on the learning of both physics and math, the\nproblem of how to effectively include math in physics in a way that reaches\nmost students remains unsolved. In this paper, we suggest that a fundamental\nissue has received insufficient exploration: the fact that in science, we don't\njust use math, we make meaning with it in a different way than mathematicians\ndo. In this reflective essay, we explore math as a language and consider the\nlanguage of math in physics through the lens of cognitive linguistics. We begin\nby offering a number of examples that show how the use of math in physics\ndiffers from the use of math as typically found in math classes. We then\nexplore basic concepts in cognitive semantics to show how humans make meaning\nwith language in general. The critical elements are the roles of embodied\ncognition and interpretation in context. Then we show how a theoretical\nframework commonly used in physics education research, resources, is coherent\nwith and extends the ideas of cognitive semantics by connecting embodiment to\nphenomenological primitives and contextual interpretation to the dynamics of\nmeaning making with conceptual resources, epistemological resources, and\naffect. We present these ideas with illustrative case studies of students\nworking on physics problems with math and demonstrate the dynamical nature of\nstudent reasoning with math in physics.

Some of the research at the upper-division focuses on how students\nuse mathematics in these problems, and what challenges students encounter along\nthe way. There are a number of different and diverse research studies on\nstudents' use of mathematics in the upper-division. These typically utilize one\nof two broad approaches, with some researchers primarily seeking out and\naddressing challenges students face, and others working chiefly to unpack\nstudents' in-the-moment reasoning. In this paper, we present and discuss both\napproaches, and then review research efforts that strive to connect these two\napproaches in order to make sense of students' use of mathematics as well as to\nuncover particular challenges that students encounter. These recent efforts\nrepresent a small step towards synthesizing the two approaches, which we argue\nis necessary to more meaningfully impact student learning at the\nupper-division.

In contrast, the mathematicians repeatedly\nreturned to speculation as to the functional form, and although they were\ncomfortable drawing qualitative conclusions about the system from measurements,\nwere reluctant to approximate the derivative through measurement.

In this synthesis and extension of prior\nwork, we demonstrate: (1) instructors vary in their approaches to teaching\ninterpretive themes; (2) different instructional approaches have differential\nimpacts on student thinking; and (3) when student interpretations go\nunattended, they often develop their own (sometimes scientifically undesirable)\nviews. We introduce here a new modern physics curriculum that explicitly\nattends to student interpretations, and provide evidence-based arguments that\ndoing so helps them to develop more consistent interpretations of quantum\nphenomena, more sophisticated views of uncertainty, and greater interest in\nquantum physics.\n",

In observing elementary and secondary teachers engaged in\nlearning activities that require tracking and conserving energy, we find that\nchallenges to energy conservation often arise in dissipative scenarios in which\nkinetic energy transforms into thermal energy (e.g., a ball rolls to a stop).\nWe find that teachers expect that when they can see the motion associated with\nkinetic energy, they should be able to perceive the warmth associated with\nthermal energy. Their expectations are violated when the warmth produced is\nimperceptible. In these cases, teachers reject the idea that the kinetic energy\ntransforms to thermal energy. Our observations suggest that apparent\ndifficulties with energy conservation may have their roots in a strong and\nproductive association between forms of energy and their perceptible\nindicators. We see teachers resolve these challenges by relating the original\nscenario to an exaggerated version in which the dissipated thermal energy is\nassociated with perceptible warmth. Using these exaggerations, teachers infer\nthat thermal energy is present to a lesser degree in the original scenario.\nThey use this exaggeration strategy to productively track and conserve energy\nin dissipative scenarios.\n",

The QuVis Quantum Mechanics\nVisualization Project develops research-based interactive simulations for the\nlearning and teaching of quantum mechanics. We describe efforts to refine the\nvisual representation of a single-photon superposition state in the QuVis\nsimulations. We developed various depictions of a photon incident on a beam\nsplitter, and investigated their influence on student thinking through\nindividual interviews. Outcomes from this study led to the incorporation of a\nrevised visualization in all QuVis single-photon simulations. In-class trials\nin 2013 and 2014 using the Interferometer Experiments simulation in an\nintroductory quantum physics course were used for a comparative study of the\ninitial and revised visualizations. The class that used the revised\nvisualization showed a lower frequency of incorrect ideas about quantum\nsuperposition, such as the photon splitting into two half-energy components.\n",

Although modeling is a\nbroadly applicable process, within physics education, it has been\npreferentially applied to the iterative development of broadly applicable\nprinciples (e.g., Newton's laws of motion in introductory mechanics). A\nsignificant feature of the new framework is that measurement tools (in addition\nto the physical system being studied) are subjected to the process of modeling.\nThink-aloud interviews were used to refine the framework and demonstrate its\nutility by documenting examples of model-based reasoning in the laboratory.\nWhen applied to the think-aloud interviews, the framework captures and\ndifferentiates students' model-based reasoning and helps identify areas of\nfuture research. The interviews showed how students productively applied\nsimilar facets of modeling to the physical system and measurement tools:\nconstruction, prediction, interpretation of data, identification of model\nlimitations, and revision. Finally, we document students' challenges in\nexplicitly articulating assumptions when constructing models of experimental\nsystems and further challenges in model construction due to students'\ninsufficient prior conceptual understanding. A modeling perspective reframes\nmany of the seemingly arbitrary technical details of measurement tools and\napparatus as an opportunity for authentic and engaging scientific sense-making.\n",

We use a parabolic support rotating around it\naxis to study the static equilibrium positions of a single sphere. Due to the\nparticular choice of the shape of support, some easy analytical calculations\nallow theoretical predictions. (i) In the frictionless case, there is an eigen\nfrequency of rotation where the gravity balances the centrifugal force. All\npositions on the parabola are therefore in static equilibrium. At others rates\nof rotation, the sphere can go to the center or escape to infinity. It depends\nonly on the sign of the detuning with the eigenfrequency. (ii) In contrast, we\nshow that the static friction imposes a range of equilibrium positions at all\nrotating rates. These predictions can be compared to the maximum equilibrium\nradius measured on the experimental device. A reasonable estimate of the static\nfriction between the support and spheres made of different materials can be\nextracted from this maximum equilibrium radius. To go further in understanding\nof the experimental results, we perform a stability analysis also in the case\nwith friction. This analysis involves the rolling friction. We show that this\nrolling friction can be estimated in the same device just by the check the\ndissipation during the motion of the sphere.\n",

First, our astronomy instructors learned to use\nresearch-based curricular materials by attending workshops before and after\nfirst implementation. Second, the astronomy instructors collaborated with\nstudent Peer Instructors as a team to document and reflect on the\nimplementation progress. Third, the instructional team of faculty and Peer\nInstructors worked with science education researchers to collect information on\ncommon student conceptual difficulties, and develop strategies to address these\ndifficulties using resources in the research and teaching literature.

To date, change efforts have\ngenerally focused on one of three areas: developing reflective teachers,\ndisseminating curricula and pedagogy, or enacting institutional policy. These\nefforts illustrate many of the challenges of departmental change; in\nparticular, they highlight the need for a holistic approach that integrates\nacross all three of these levels: individual faculty, whole departments, and\nuniversity policymakers. To address these challenges, as part of our\ncampus-wide AAU-sponsored effort in STEM education transformation, we import\nand integrate models of change from multiple perspectives.

The physics education\nresearch literature has reported students conceptions of electric fields\npost-instruction as indicated by students performance on textbook-style\nquestions. It has, however, inadequately captured student ideas expressed in\nother situations yet informative to educational research. In this study, we\nexplore students ideas of electric fields pre-instruction as shown by students\nrepresentations produced in open-ended activities. 92 participant students\ncompleted a worksheet that involved drawing comic strips about electric charges\nas characters of a cartoon series. Three students who had spontaneously\nproduced arrow diagrams were interviewed individually after class. We\nidentified nine ideas related to electric fields that these three students\nspontaneously leveraged in the comic strip activity. In this paper, we describe\nin detail each idea and its situated context. As most research in the\nliterature has understood students as having relatively fixed conceptions and\nmostly identified divergences in those conceptions from canonical targets, this\nstudy shows students reasoning to be more variable in particular moments, and\nthat variability includes common sense resources that can be productive for\nlearning about electric fields.\n",

Here we relate a lesser-known cognitive bias, the \"outcome\norientation\", to medical questions and describe the harm that the outcome\norientation can do to medical research and practice. People who reason\naccording to an outcome orientation interpret probability as a subjective\ndegree of belief that is constrained to consider events one at a time, in a way\nthat is incompatible with Bayesian reasoning. Instead of accepting that\nuncertainty is inevitable, and generalizing from the frequency of similar\nevents, the outcome orientation prefers one-off causal narratives. In medicine,\nthe outcome orientation therefore erodes support for randomized controlled\ntrials in favor of reductionist approaches. The rhetoric of personalized\nmedicine resonates with, and can promote, the outcome orientation, by\nemphasizing how the measurable attributes of individual patients, rather than\nchance or unknowable factors, causally produce each particular patient's\noutcome.\n",

Second, at\nthe same time, many faculty think that RBAs are limited and don't measure many\nof the things they care about, or aren't applicable in their classes.

The simulation shows (N=100) identical spring-mass systems being\nsubjected to (1) periodic driving force of equal amplitude but different\ndriving frequencies and (2) different amount of damping. The simulation aims to\ncreate a visually intuitive way of understanding how the series of amplitude\nversus driving frequency graphs are obtained by showing how the displacement of\nthe system changes over time as it transits from the transient to the steady\nstate.\n  A suggested how to use the model is added to help educators and students in\ntheir teaching and learning, where we explained the theoretical steady state\nequation, time conditions when the model starts allowing data recording of\nmaximum amplitudes to closely match the theoretical equation and steps to\ncollect different runs of degree of damping. We also discuss two design\nfeatures in our computer model: A) displaying the instantaneous oscillation\ntogether with the achieved steady state amplitudes and B) explicit world view\noverlay with scientific representation with different degrees of damping runs.\n  Three advantages of using EJS include 1) Open Source Codes and Creative\nCommons Attribution Licenses for scaling up of interactively engaging\neducational practices 2) models made can run on almost any device including\nAndroid and iOS and 3) allows for redefining physics educational practices\nthrough computer modeling. 2015 resource:\nhttp://iwant2study.org/ospsg/index.php/interactive-resources/physics/02-newtonian-mechanics/09-oscillations/88-shm24\n",

This dissertation research was founded on the desire of a teacher to\nmake physics class exciting and motivating to his students. This work explores\nhow various aspects of learning environments interact with student motivation.\nThis work uses qualitative and quantitative methods to explore how students are\nmotivated to engage in physics and how they feel about themselves while\nengaging in physics. The collection of four studies in this dissertation\nculminates in a sociocultural perspective on motivation and identity. This\nperspective uses two extremes of how students experience physics as a lens for\nunderstanding motivation: fear and self-preservation versus integrity and\nself-expression. Rather than viewing motivation as a property of the student,\nor viewing students as inherently interested or disinterested in physics, the\ntheoretical perspective on motivation and identity helps examine features of\nthe learning environments that determine how students experience themselves\nthrough physics class. This perspective highlights the importance of feeling a\nsense of belonging in the context of physics and the power that teachers have\nin shaping student motivations through the construction of their classroom\nlearning environments. Findings demonstrate how different ways that students\nexperience themselves in physics class impact their performance and interest in\nphysics. This dissertation concludes with a set of design principles that can\nfoster integration and integrity among students in physics learning\nenvironments.\n",

We propose that\ncharacterizations of progress in responsive teaching should also consider the\ndisciplinary centrality of the practices teachers notice and respond to within\nstudent thinking. To illustrate what this kind of progress can look like, we\npresent a case study of a middle school science teacher who implemented the\n\"same\" lesson on the motion of freely falling objects in two subsequent years.\nWe argue that his primary shift in responsiveness stemmed from a shift in which\ndisciplinary practices he preferentially noticed and foregrounded. He moved\nfrom a focus on causal factors or variables to a more scientifically productive\nfocus on causal stories or explanations. We explore how participation in a\nprofessional development community, institutional constraints, and a shift in\npersonal epistemology may have contributed to the nature and stability of this\nshift in responsiveness.\n",

Through analysis of\ninterviews and classroom interactions, we show how Estevan's love of science\ncan be partially explained by an alignment between his identity as a lover of\nchallenges and his epistemology of science as involving the challenge of\nfiguring things out for yourself. This alignment was possible in part because\nit was supported by his caring teacher, who attended to his ideas and\nconstantly challenged him and the rest of her students to figure things out for\nthemselves instead of just \"giving them the answers.\"\n",

Both of these traits mask the true ability of\nthe learner, which is the only trait considered in most mainstream\nunidimensional IRT models. We find that indeed the introduction of these traits\nallows to better assess the true ability of the learners, as well as to better\ngauge the quality of assessment items. Correspondence of the model traits to\nself-reported behavior is investigated and confirmed.

The difference persisted at a reduced level\nafter subsequent direct instruction.

This virtual learning\nresource was implemented in the Web ARCO platform and allows training, by\nfacing test models comparable in both time and difficulty to those that they\nwill have to solve during the course. It also provides a feedback mechanism for\nboth: 1) The students, since they can verify the level of their knowledge. Once\nthey have finished the simulations, they can access a complete problem-solving\nheuristic report of each problem; 2) The teachers, since they can obtain\ninformation about the habits of the students in their strategies of\npreparation; and they also can diagnose the weaknesses of the students prior to\nthe exam.\n  This study indicates how this kind of preparation generates substantial\nimprovements on the approval rates by allowing the students: 1) A more\nstructured and oriented systematic study, and 2) To learn, from the feedback\nreport of each problem that the information described in their exams should\nhave, at each stage, a proper logical connection. Likewise, this study allows\ndifferentiating how the repetition in the use of the platform and the formality\nin the time invested indicate clear differences on the obtained performance.\n",

Extant\nliterature on teacher preparation suggests that pre-service teachers learn best\nwhen they are immersed in a community that allows them to develop dispositions,\nknowledge, and practical skills and share with the community a strong vision of\nwhat good teaching entails. However, despite having developed the requisite\ndispositions, knowledge, and skills in pursuing the shared vision of good\nteaching, the professional demands on a teacher's time are so great out of and\nso complex during class time that if every decision requires multiple\nconsiderations and deliberations with oneself, the productive decisions might\nnot materialize. We therefore argue that the missing link between intentional\ndecision-making and actual teaching practice are the teacher's habits\n(spontaneous responses to situational cues). Teachers unavoidably develop\nhabits with practical experience and under the influence of knowledge and\nbelief structures that in many ways condition the responses of teachers in\ntheir practical work. To steer new teachers away from developing unproductive\nhabits directed towards \"survival\" instead of student learning, we argue that\nany teacher preparation program (e.g., physics) should strive to develop in\npre-service teachers strong habits of mind and practice that will serve as an\nunderlying support structure for beginning teachers. These habits form the core\nof the conceptual model described in the paper. We provide examples of habits,\nwhich physics teachers need to develop before starting teaching and propose\nmechanisms for the development of such habits.\n",

This study reviews\nliterature in several disciplines, including spatial cognition, to identify ten\ncontextual and representational problem features that are most likely to\ninfluence performance on problems requiring a right-hand rule. Two quantitative\nmeasures of performance (correctness and response time) and two qualitative\nmeasures (methods used and type of errors made) were used to explore the impact\nof these problem features on student performance. Quantitative results are\nconsistent with expectations from the literature, but reveal that some features\n(such as the type of reasoning required and the physical awkwardness of using a\nright-hand rule) have a greater impact than others (such as whether the vectors\nare placed together or separate). Additional insight is gained by the\nqualitative analysis, including identifying sources of difficulty not\npreviously discussed in the literature and revealing that the use of\nsupplemental methods, such as physically rotating the paper, can mitigate\nerrors associated with certain features.\n",

        "summary": "  Separation of variables can be a powerful technique for solving many of the\npartial differential equations that arise in physics contexts. Upper-division\nphysics students encounter this technique in multiple topical areas including\nelectrostatics and quantum mechanics. To better understand the difficulties\nstudents encounter when utilizing the separation of variables technique, we\nexamined students' responses to midterm exam questions and a standardized\nconceptual assessment, and conducted think-aloud, problem-solving interviews.\nOur analysis was guided by an analytical framework that focuses on how students\nactivate, construct, execute, and reflect on the separation of variables\ntechnique when solving physics problems. Here we focus on student difficulties\nwith separation of variables as a technique to solve Laplace's equation in both\nCartesian and spherical coordinates in the context of junior-level\nelectrostatics. Challenges include: recognizing when separation of variables is\nthe appropriate tool; recalling/justifying the separated form of the potential\nand the need for the infinite sum; identifying implicit boundary conditions;\nand spontaneously reflecting on their solutions. Moreover, the type and\nfrequency of errors was often different for SoV problems in Cartesian and\nspherical geometries. We also briefly discuss implication of these our findings\nfor instruction.\n",

A growing body of PER examines gender differences in\nparticipation, performance, and attitudes toward physics. We have three\ncritiques of this work: (1) it does not question whether the achievements of\nmen are the most appropriate standard, (2) individual experiences and student\nidentities are undervalued, and (3) the binary model of gender is not\nquestioned. Driven by these critiques, we propose a conception of gender that\nis more up-to-date with other fields and discuss gender-as-performance as an\nextended example. We also discuss work on the intersection of identities [e.g.,\ngender with race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, lesbian, gay, bisexual,\nand transgender (LGBT) status], much of which has been conducted outside of\nphysics. Within PER, some studies examine the intersection of gender and race,\nand identify the lack of a single identity as a key challenge of \"belonging\" in\nphysics. Acknowledging this complexity enables us to further critique what we\nterm a binary gender deficit model. This framework, which is implicit in much\nof the gender-based PER, casts gender as a fixed binary trait and suggests that\nwomen are deficient in characteristics necessary to succeed. Alternative models\nof gender allow a greater range and fluidity of gender identities, and\nhighlight deficiencies in data that exclude women's experiences. We suggest new\ninvestigations that diverge from this expanded gender framework in PER.\n",

        "summary": "  We present results of our investigation into student understanding of the\nphysical significance and utility of the Boltzmann factor in several simple\nmodels. We identify various justifications, both correct and incorrect, that\nstudents use when answering written questions that require application of the\nBoltzmann factor. Results from written data as well as teaching interviews\nsuggest that many students can neither recognize situations in which the\nBoltzmann factor is applicable, nor articulate the physical significance of the\nBoltzmann factor as an expression for multiplicity, a fundamental quantity of\nstatistical mechanics. The specific student difficulties seen in the written\ndata led us to develop a guided-inquiry tutorial activity, centered around the\nderivation of the Boltzmann factor, for use in undergraduate statistical\nmechanics courses. We report on the development process of our tutorial,\nincluding data from teaching interviews and classroom observations on student\ndiscussions about the Boltzmann factor and its derivation during the tutorial\ndevelopment process. This additional information informed modifications that\nimproved students' abilities to complete the tutorial during the allowed class\ntime without sacrificing the effectiveness as we have measured it. These data\nalso show an increase in students' appreciation of the origin and significance\nof the Boltzmann factor during the student discussions. Our findings provide\nevidence that working in groups to better understand the physical origins of\nthe canonical probability distribution helps students gain a better\nunderstanding of when the Boltzmann factor is applicable and how to use it\nappropriately in answering relevant questions.\n",

The need for\nsuch quantitative critical thinking occurs in many different contexts, and\nwhile it is an important goal of education, that goal is seldom being achieved.\nWe argue that the key element for developing this ability is repeated practice\nin making decisions based on data, with feedback on those decisions. We\ndemonstrate a structure for providing suitable practice that can be applied in\nany instructional setting that involves the acquisition of data and relating\nthat data to scientific models. This study reports the results of applying that\nstructure in an introductory physics lab course. Students in an experimental\ncondition were repeatedly instructed to make and act on quantitative\ncomparisons between datasets, and between data and models, an approach that is\ncommon to all science disciplines. These instructions were slowly faded across\nthe course. After the instructions had been removed, students in the\nexperimental condition were 12 times more likely to spontaneously propose or\nmake changes to improve their experimental methods than a control group, who\nperformed traditional experimental activities. They were also four times more\nlikely to identify and explain a limitation of a physical model using their\ndata. Students in the experimental condition also showed much more\nsophisticated reasoning about their data. These differences between the groups\nwere seen to persist into a subsequent course taken the following year.\n",

It is common to look at\nstudents' changes in their answers between a pre-test and a post-test to\nquantify a transition in student's conceptions. This is often done by looking\nat the proportion of incorrect answers in the pre-test that changes to correct\nanswers in the post-test -- the gain -- and the proportion of correct answers\nthat changes to incorrect answers -- the loss. By comparing theoretical\npredictions to experimental data on the Force Concept Inventory, we shown that\nItem Response Theory (IRT) is able to fairly well predict the observed gains\nand losses. We then use IRT to quantify the student's changes in a test-retest\nsituation when no learning occurs and show that $i)$ up to 25\\% of total\nanswers can change due to the non-deterministic nature of student's answer and\nthat $ii)$ gains and losses can go from 0\\% to 100\\%. Still using IRT, we\nhighlight the conditions that must satisfy a test in order to minimize gains\nand losses when no learning occurs. Finally, recommandations on the\ninterpretation of such pre/post-test progression with respect to the initial\nlevel of students are proposed.\n",

The primary aim of developing a game-based platform for\nstudent-research collaboration is to investigate if and how this type of game\nconcept can strengthen authentic experimental practice and the creation of new\nknowledge in science education. Researchers and game developers tested the game\nin three separate high school classes. The tests were documented using video\nobservations of students playing the game, qualitative interviews, and\nqualitative and quantitative questionnaires. The focus of the tests has been to\nstudy players motivation and their experience of learning through participation\nin authentic scientific inquiry. In questionnaires conducted in the two first\ntest classes students found that the aspects of doing real scientific research\nand solving physics problems were the more interesting aspects of playing the\ngame. However, designing a game that facilitates professional research\ncollaboration while simultaneously introducing quantum physics to high school\nstudents proved to be a challenge. A collaborative learning design was\nimplemented in Class 3, where students were given expert roles such as\nexperimental and theoretical physicists. This significantly improved the\nstudents feeling of learning physics compared to Class 1 and 2. Overall the\nresults presented in this paper indicate that the possibility of participating\nin authentic scientific experiments, which this class of games opens, is highly\nmotivating for students. The findings also show that the learning design in the\nclass setting must be considered in order to improve the students' experience\nof learning and that various design challenges remain to be addressed further.\n",

When I say 'good mental health,' I\nmean one has to develop a set of healthy coping strategies, be in a positive\nlearning environment, and have a social support system. Traditionally,\nuniversities have been the venue of such higher learning. If these institutions\nwant to remain as thriving grounds for higher education and engines of\nresearch, post-secondary institutions need to be aware of these factors and\nactively contribute to the well-being of its students and faulty.\nUnfortunately, students do not always receive the support necessary to be\nmentally healthy. The purpose of this paper is to examine how social awareness\nand sensitivity of mental health in a university setting is a key component for\nindividuals to flourish academically and grow personally. Several voluntary\nsurveys completed by my first and second year math students at the University\nof Waterloo will be presented. The surveys investigated the students'\nexperiences at the university, particularly in the Mathematics Department. In\naddition, this paper explores an alternative way to structure math classes,\nspecifically assignment scheduling, in order to help students develop healthy\nstudy habits. The scores for the alternative-scheduled assignments are\nstatistically analyzed and compared to scores of the typical-scheduled\nassignments currently implemented at the University of Waterloo. Finally, this\npaper briefly discusses the importance of socialization, specifically for young\nmathematicians and scientists, and potential consequences of reduced social\nexposure in the Digital Age.\n",

We started the 'Science is fun' outreach\nprogramme to address these problems.

We were also pleasantly surprised to see students engaging with new\nconcepts and not hesitating to participate in the discussions. We tried to\nensure teachers were central to the activities, and also designed the\nexperiments to be easily repeatable so that teachers could incorporate them\ninto their own lessons once the workshops were over.

In Democracy and Education, Dewey links \"democracy\" with a\ndistinctive understanding of \"experience\". For Dewey, the value of educational\nexperiences lies in \"the unity or integrity of experience\" (DE, 248). In Art as\nExperience, Dewey presents aesthetic experience as the fundamental form of\nhuman experience that undergirds all other forms of experiences, and can also\nbring together multiple forms of experiences, locating this form of experience\nin the work of artists. Particularly relevant to our current concern\n(computational literacy), Dewey calls the process through which a person\ntransforms a material into an expressive medium an aesthetic experience (AE,\n68-69). We argue here that the kind of experience that is appropriate for a\ndemocratic education in the context of children's computational science is\nessentially aesthetic in nature. Given that aesthetics has received relatively\nlittle attention in STEM education research, our purpose here is to highlight\nthe power of Deweyan aesthetic experience in making computational thinking\navailable to and attractive to all children, including those who are\ndisinterested in computing, and especially those who are likely to be\ndiscounted by virtue of location, gender or race.\n",

Physics instructors note that their\nstudents experience difficulty with basic algebraic reasoning, a foundation on\nwhich more advanced mathematical thinking rests. However, little systematic\nresearch has been done to measure and categorize such difficulties in this\npopulation. This paper describes an investigation of trends in student\nreasoning with proportions, quantification, and symbolizing in introductory\ncalculus-based physics. Although the assessment items used to probe student\nthinking require mathematical reasoning typically taught at the middle school\nlevel in mathematics courses, we find success rates of about 50% among\ncalculus-based physics students. For many of these students, numerical\ncomplexity and the level of abstraction of the quantities interfere with basic\narithmetic reasoning. We argue that the algebraic thinking of physicists stems\nfrom an idiosyncratic cognitive blend, which is not addressed in prerequisite\nalgebra courses. We suggest that for more students to understand and adopt the\nmathematical thinking characteristic of physics, instructors and education\nresearchers must explore how to make mathematization a more explicit part of\nthe curriculum.\n",

Ultimately, we argue that\ncentralized administration and data collection for standardized assessments is\na viable and potentially advantageous alternative to the default model\ncharacterized by decentralized administration and analysis. Moreover, with the\nhelp of online administration and automation, this model can support the\nlong-term sustainability of centralized assessment systems.\n",

        "summary": "  Differentiation is a mathematical skill applied throughout science in order\nto describe the change of a function with respect to a dependent variable.\nThus, an intuitive understanding of differentiation is necessary to work with\nthe mathematical frameworks used to describe physical systems in the higher\nlevels of education. In order to obtain this intuition repeated practice is\nrequired. This paper presents the development of DiffGame, which consists of a\nseries of exercises that introduce the basic principles of differentiation for\nhigh-school students through game-like elements. DiffGame have been tested with\n117 first-year students from a single Danish high school, who did not have any\nprior training in differentiation. The students' learning was assessed by the\ndata obtained directly from DiffGame. The test demonstrated the efficacy of\nDiffGame, since students at all levels demonstrate a learning gain. In contrast\nto previous studies demonstrating most learning in the lower tier of students,\nthe middle tier of students (based on overall performance) exhibits the largest\nlearning gains.\n",

Understanding TAs'\nperceptions of grading is instrumental for curriculum developers as well as\nprofessional development leaders interested in improving grading practices. In\norder to identify TAs' perceptions of grading, we used a data collection tool\ndesigned to elicit TAs' considerations when making grading decisions as well as\nelicit possible conflicts between their stated goals and actual grading\npractices. The tool was designed to explicate TAs' attitudes towards\nresearch-based grading practices that promote effective problem solving\napproaches. TAs were first asked to state their goals for grading in general.\nThen, TAs graded student solutions in a simulated setting while explicating and\ndiscussing their underlying considerations. The data collection tool was\nadministered at the beginning of TAs' first postgraduate teaching appointment\nand again after one semester of teaching experience. We found that almost all\nof the TAs stated that the purpose of grading was formative, i.e., grading\nshould encourage students to learn from their mistakes as well as inform the\ninstructor of common student difficulties. However, when making grading\ndecisions in a simulated setting, the majority of TAs' grading considerations\nfocused on correctness and they did not assign grades in a way that encourages\nuse of effective problem solving approaches. TAs' perceptions of grading did\nnot change significantly during one semester of teaching experience.\n",

On the final exam with only\nmultiple-choice questions, the PR group drew diagrams on more problems than the\ntraditional group, even when there was no external reward for doing so. Since\nthere was no partial credit for drawing the diagrams on the scratch books,\nstudents did not draw diagrams simply to get credit for the effort shown and\nmust value the use of diagrams for solving problems if they drew them.

PAR involves students using peer feedback to\nimprove their work on open-ended homework problems. Collaborating with peers\nand revising one's work based on the feedback of others are important aspects\nof doing and learning physics. While notable exceptions exist, homework and\nexams are generally individual activities that do not support collaboration and\nrefinement, which misses important opportunities to use assessment for\nlearning. In contrast, PAR provides students with a structure to iteratively\nengage with challenging, open-ended problems and solicit the input of their\npeers to improve their work.\n",

Furthermore, a large\nmajority of those interviewed explained that they did not receive any formal\ntraining in maintaining a lab notebook during their graduate school experience\nand received little to no feedback from their advisors on these records.

Prior research in the US using a validated Attitude and\nApproaches to Problem Solving (AAPS) survey suggests that there are major\ndifferences between students in introductory physics and astronomy courses and\nphysics experts in terms of their attitudes and approaches to physics problem\nsolving. Here we discuss the validation, administration and analysis of data\nfor the Turkish version of the AAPS survey for high school and university\nstudents in Turkey. After the validation and administration of the Turkish\nversion of the survey, the analysis of the data was conducted by grouping the\ndata by grade level, school type, and gender. While there are no statistically\nsignificant differences between the averages of various groups on the survey,\noverall, the university students in Turkey were more expert-like than\nvocational high school students. On an item by item basis, there are\nstatistically differences between the averages of the groups on many items. For\nexample, on average, the university students demonstrated less expert-like\nattitudes about the role of equations and formulas in problem solving, in\nsolving difficult problems, and in knowing when the solution is not correct,\nwhereas they displayed more expert-like attitudes and approaches on items\nrelated to meta-cognition in physics problem solving. A principal component\nanalysis on the data yields item clusters into which the student responses on\nvarious survey items can be grouped. A comparison of the responses of the\nTurkish and American university students enrolled in algebra-based introductory\nphysics courses shows that on more than half of the items, the responses of\nthese two groups were statistically significantly different with the US\nstudents on average responding to the items in more expert-like manner.\n",

It takes place when the driven and\nnatural frequencies of the system are slightly different and interfere\nconstructively and destructively, forming the so called beats. The frequency of\nthe beats is just the difference of the interfering waves frequencies. Beats\nare very noticeable in acoustic systems. We all have probably perceived them in\nthe form of periodic ups and downs in the sound intensity volume. There are\nseveral works in this journal on visualizing the beats in acoustic systems. For\ninstance, the microphone and the speaker of two mobile devices were used in\nprevious work to analyze the acoustic beat produced by two signals of close\nfrequencies. The formation of beats can also be visualized in mechanical\nsystems, such as a mass-spring system5 or a double driven string. Hereafter,\nthe mechanical beats in a smartphone-spring system are directly visualized in a\nsimple way. The frequency of the beats is measured by means of the acceleration\nsensor of a smartphone which hangs from a spring attached to a motor driver.\n",

The barometric pressure obtained with the smartphone is related to the\naltitude of the device via the hydrostatic approximation. From the altitude\nvalues, vertical velocities are derived. The approximation considered is valid\nin the first hundred meters of the inner layers of the atmosphere. In addition\nto pressure, acceleration values were also recorded using the built-in\naccelerometer. Numerical integration was performed, obtaining both vertical\nvelocity and altitude. We show that data obtained using the pressure sensor is\nsignificantly less noisy than that obtained using the accelerometer. Error\naccumulation is also evident in the numerical integration of the acceleration\nvalues. In the proposed experiments, the pressure sensor also outperforms GPS,\nbecause this sensor does not receive satellite signals indoors and, in general,\nthe operating frequency is considerably lower than that of the pressure sensor.\nIn the cases in which it is possible, comparison with reference values taken\nfrom the architectural plans of buildings validates the results obtained using\nthe pressure sensor. This proposal is ideally performed as an external or\noutreach activity with students to gain insight about fundamental questions in\nmechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics.\n",

Students enrolled in courses where ACE-M was used as the foundation\nfor problem-solving instruction reported improved problem-solving\nself-efficacy, more monitoring while solving problems, and in many cases\nimproved course grades.

        "summary": "  Over the past 10 years, we have developed at University Paris Sud a first\nyear course on geometrical optics centered on experimentation. In contrast with\nthe traditional top-down learning structure usually applied at university, in\nwhich practical sessions are often a mere verification of the laws taught\nduring preceding lectures, this course promotes \"active learning\" and focuses\non experiments made by the students. Interaction among students and self\nquestioning are strongly encouraged and practicing comes first, before any\ntheoretical knowledge. Through a series of concrete examples, the present paper\ndescribes the philosophy underlying the teaching in this course. We demonstrate\nthat not only geometrical optics can be taught through experiments, but also\nthat it can serve as a useful introduction to experimental physics. Feedback\nover the last ten years shows that our approach succeeds in helping students to\nlearn better and acquire motivation and autonomy. This approach can easily be\napplied to other fields of physics.\n",

We collected audio data from interviews with 20\nelectronics instructors from 18 institutions that varied by size, selectivity,\nand other factors. In addition to describing participants' instructional\npractices, we characterize their perceptions about the role of troubleshooting\nin electronics, the importance of the ability to troubleshoot more generally,\nand what it means for students to be competent troubleshooters. One major\nfinding of this work is that, while almost all instructors in our study said\nthat troubleshooting is an important learning outcome for students in\nelectronics lab courses, only half of instructors said they directly assessed\nstudents' ability to troubleshoot. Based on our findings, we argue that there\nis a need for research-based instructional materials that attend to both\ncognitive and non-cognitive aspects of troubleshooting proficiency.

At the end of the semester, the students reported\nincreased knowledge of the TA as a person and as an instructor, and vice versa.\nSixty-five percent of students reported no interest in changing circumstances\nto make it easier to talk about personal concerns with the TA.

While students'\nacademic and social integration into an institution seems to be vital for\nstudent retention, research into the effect of interpersonal interactions is\nrare. We use network analysis as an approach to investigate academic and social\nexperiences of students in the classroom. In particular, centrality measures\nidentify patterns of interaction that contribute to integration into the\nuniversity. Using these measures, we analyze how position within a social\nnetwork in a Modeling Instruction (MI) course -- an introductory physics course\nthat strongly emphasizes interactive learning -- predicts their persistence in\ntaking a subsequent physics course. Students with higher centrality at the end\nof the first semester of MI are more likely to enroll in a second semester of\nMI. Moreover, we found that chances of successfully predicting individual\nstudent's persistence based on centrality measures are fairly high -- up to\n$75\\%$, making the centrality a good predictor of persistence. These findings\nsuggest that increasing student social integration may help in improving\npersistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.\n",

However, there is\nlittle consensus among instructors and researchers interested in the laboratory\nlearning environment as to relative importance of these various learning goals.\nHere, we contribute data to this debate through the analysis of students'\nresponses to the laboratory-focused assessment known as the Colorado Learning\nAttitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). Using a\nlarge, national data set of students' responses, we compare students' E-CLASS\nperformance in classes in which the instructor self-reported focusing on\ndeveloping skills, reinforcing concepts, or both. As the classification of\ncourses was based on instructor self-report, we also provide additional\ndescription of these course with respect to how often students engage in\nparticular activities in the lab. We find that courses that focus specifically\non developing lab skills have more expert-like postinstruction E-CLASS\nresponses than courses that focus either on reinforcing physics concepts or on\nboth goals. Within first-year courses, this effect is larger for women.\nMoreover, these findings hold when controlling for the variance in\npostinstruction scores that is associated with preinstruction E-CLASS score,\nstudent major, and student gender.\n",

Instead, we address holistic considerations\nfor the purpose of scientific documentation that can guide students to develop\ntheir own documentation style. Taking into consideration all the aspects that\ncan help improve students' documentation, it is also important to consider the\ndesign of the lab activities themselves. Students should have experience with\nimplementing these authentic features of documentation during lab activities in\norder for them to find practice with documentation beneficial.\n",

Kankor is very important\nand requires further research as it is used as the only means to identify the\nparticipant's competence and skills which leads to a qualified higher education\nand manpower, employment opportunities, allocation of human capital in\nappropriate fields of study, and leading to a more specialized labor force in\nthe long run.\n  Having a better picture of Kankor in Afghanistan is essential before\nemploying educational data mining techniques and other social and pedagogical\napproaches to support the students and the educational institutions. Hence, the\nauthor carried out a research on Kankor, in which he assessed and analyzed\nKankor from different angles. This research paper provides positive\ncontribution to the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), particularly, the\nKankor committee, and other educational institutions - introducing the\nimportance of data as an asset and a proper structure of recording and\nproducing data effective for research studies, paving the way for in-depth\ndescriptive and predictive analytics which improves the situation within the\ncontext of the existing structural models in Afghanistan.\n  The author's research target is to study Kankor using descriptive analytics\nsupported by Kankor Results Data (KRD) of 1.5 million records from 2003-2015,\nDetailed Kankor Results Data which is a subset of KRD from 2004-2006 of 120,000\nrecords, High school performance and grades data from 2011-2013 of 6,000\nrecords, data collected through conducting more than 2500 questionnaires among\nacademicians as well as the author's personal observations, findings, and\nanalyses as a student and faculty member at the University in the field of\ncomputer science.\n",

This harm is problematic because\nself-efficacy supports student learning and persistence. Nissen and Shemwell\n(PhysRevPER, 12, 2016) investigated this harm using an in-the-moment measure of\nstudent's self-efficacy states, which are dynamic judgments of one's ability to\nsucceed in the activity at hand. Their results indicated that female students\nexperienced much lower self-efficacy states in physics than male students did,\nand that this gender difference did not occur in other STEM courses. A\nlimitation of their study was that it only investigated a single college\nphysics course. In order to further inform the generalizability of this\nphenomenon I analyzed a large data set of 35,464 experiences from 4,816\nstudents at 33 secondary schools collected between 1993 and 1997 that was\ndesigned to be representative of high school students' experiences. Results\nconfirmed that there was a large gender difference in self-efficacy states in\nhigh school physics courses and not in any other courses. The identification of\nthis phenomenon in two very different settings indicates that physics\ninstruction systemically harms female students' belief in their ability to\nlearn and do physics.\n",

The use of models is a ubiquitous practice in undergraduate physics\neducation, but the process of constructing, testing, and refining these models\nis much less common. We focus our attention on a lab course that has been\ntransformed to engage students in this modeling process during lab activities.\nThe design of the lab activities was guided by a framework that captures the\ndifferent components of model-based reasoning, called the Modeling Framework\nfor Experimental Physics. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to\nassess students' written work and to identify how students' model-based\nreasoning differed from activity to activity. Broadly speaking, we were able to\nidentify the different steps of students' model-based reasoning and assess the\ncompleteness of their reasoning. Varying degrees of scaffolding present across\nthe activities had an impact on how thoroughly students would engage in the\nfull modeling process, with more scaffolded activities resulting in more\nthorough engagement with the process. Finally, we identified that the step in\nthe process with which students had the most difficulty was the comparison\nbetween their interpreted data and their model prediction. Students did not use\nsufficiently sophisticated criteria in evaluating such comparisons, which had\nthe effect of halting the modeling process. This may indicate that in order to\nengage students further in using model-based reasoning during lab activities,\nthe instructor needs to provide further scaffolding for how students make these\ntypes of experimental comparisons. This is an important design consideration\nfor other such courses attempting to incorporate modeling as a learning goal.\n",

The current work\nexamines the relationship between gender and undergraduate physics study, using\ncourse records from over nine thousand students who enrolled in physics at the\nUniversity of Auckland, spanning a six year period.\n  Physics students' demographic and course records were analyzed to find out\nwhether there were gender differences in subject selection, course performance,\nand confidence. Subsequent to taking a first year physics course, female\nstudents were more likely to take further courses in life science subjects,\nwhile male students were more likely to take physical science subjects. In\nfirst year courses, gender differences were not present among highly\nacademically prepared students, for whom school type (single-sex or\ncoeducational) was a better predictor of course outcome. However, of those\nstudents who were less academically prepared in their first year, male students\ntended to outperform female students. Female students were also more likely to\ntake an introductory physics course before an advancing course, compared to\nmale students, after controlling for academic preparation. Science capital, a\nconcept related to Pierre Bourdieu's notions of capital and habitus, was\nemployed as an interpretive research framework. Habitus, the system of\ndispositions one uses to interpret the world, is largely influenced by the\nsocio-cultural context in which an individual builds their identity. The\nfollowing study explains how an interaction between science capital and an\nindividual's habitus may lead to gender disparities in student outcomes in the\nfield of physics.\n",

We find that, while\npseudo-longitudinal averages showed increases in students' E-CLASS scores in\neach consecutive course, analysis of longitudinal data indicates that this\nincrease was not driven by a cumulative impact of laboratory instruction.\nRather, the increase was driven by a selection effect in which students who\npersisted into higher-level lab courses already had more expert-like beliefs,\nattitudes, and expectations than their peers when they started the lower-level\ncourses.\n",

Collaborative learning\nenvironments, such as those employed in the Modeling Instruction introductory\nphysics course, provide structure for student engagement by encouraging\npeer-to-peer interactions. Because of the inherently social nature of\ncollaborative learning, we examine student interactions in the classroom using\nnetwork analysis. We use centrality---a family of measures that quantify how\nconnected or \"central\" a particular student is within the classroom\nnetwork---to study student engagement longitudinally. Bootstrapped linear\nregression modeling shows that students' centrality predicts future academic\nperformance over and above prior GPA for three out of four centrality measures\ntested. In particular, we find that closeness centrality explains 28 % more of\nthe variance than prior GPA alone. These results confirm that student\nengagement in the classroom is critical to supporting academic performance.\nFurthermore, we find that this relationship for social interactions does not\nemerge until the second half of the semester, suggesting that classroom\ncommunity develops over time in a meaningful way.\n",

In this paper, through\ncareful analysis of classroom videos, I present a case study about the group\nmentioned above. The results show that high school students encountered and\ndealt with multiple types of tensions in the activity and explored the\nelectrostatic phenomena simulated by the Electric Field Hockey. Students\nprioritized exploring different types of phenomena when they encountered\ndifferent types of tensions. Based on the findings I propose: When carrying out\nan activity with a novel educational tool, a teacher can attend to, and jump in\nat appropriate points, when tensions arises thus to orient students to explore\nthe simulated physical phenomena in more productive ways.\n",

The ability to retain\nstudents seems to be intimately tied with understanding their immersion into\nthe academic and social system of an institution. For instance, it has been\nnoted that insufficient interactions with peers can lead to a low commitment to\nthe university and, ultimately, affect one's decision about whether to drop\nout. Since nearly half of first-time students who leave a university by the end\nof the freshman year never come back to college, the importance of\nunderstanding experiences in introductory courses as a means for improving\nstudents' persistence is particularly pronounced. We investigate students'\nexperiences in an introductory physics courses, focusing on their self-reported\nperception of the values of out-of-class collaborations.

Once in a STEM field,\nacademic and social integration has been long thought to be important for\nstudents' persistence. Yet, it is rarely investigated. In particular, the\nrelative impact of in-class and out-of-class interactions remains an open\nissue. Here, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, for students whose grades fall\nin the \"middle of the pack,\" the out-of-class network is the most significant\npredictor of persistence. To do so, we use logistic regression combined with\nAkaike's information criterion to assess in- and out-of-class networks, grades,\nand other factors. For students with grades at the very top (and bottom), final\ngrade, unsurprisingly, is the best predictor of persistence---these students\nare likely already committed (or simply restricted from continuing) so they\npersist (or drop out). For intermediate grades, though, only out-of-class\ncloseness---a measure of one's immersion in the network---helps predict\npersistence. This does not negate the need for in-class ties. However, it\nsuggests that, in this cohort, only students that get past the convenient\nin-class interactions and start forming strong bonds outside of class are or\nbecome committed to their studies. Since many students are lost through\nattrition, our results suggest practical routes for increasing students'\npersistence in STEM majors.\n",

To address this gap, we present the\nfirst large-scale, national study ($N_{institutions}=75$ and\n$N_{students}=7167$) of undergraduate physics lab courses through analysis of\nstudents' responses to a research-validated assessment designed to investigate\nstudents' beliefs about the nature of experimental physics.

Within the lecture, various modern methods for atomistic materials\nmodeling are presented. Originally, the course was conceived as a traditional\nlecture. That didactic-methodical conception, however, does not seem to be\nideal to support the students in reaching the educational objectives and to\nfoster the students' interest in the covered topics. A new didactic concept\nbased on interactive engagement is designed to allow for a more individual and\nresearch-oriented learning experience of the students. To this end, team-work\nunits involving worksheets and computer exercises are established replacing\ntraditional lectures. Additionally, the students get the possibility to sketch\nresearch proposals in small teams during their individual study time. The\nstudents are supposed to apply, discuss, and immerse themselves in selected\ntopics of the lecture via those new elements. The effects of these innovations\non the students' ability to reach the educational objectives and on their level\nof interest in related research activities are investigated in this work using\nseveral questionnaires, observations by the lectures, and the results of the\nfinal exams as data sources. The analysis shows that the students are highly in\nfavor of the new, interactive elements. Those elements support the students in\nreaching important educational objectives of the lecture. Moreover, the\ninterest in research is increased. The questionnaires and exams, however,\nindicate some room for improvement. For example, the assessment of the\nlimitations of different methods is difficult for the students. Consequently,\nan updated version of the presented concept including the findings of this work\nis supposed to be implemented in the future.\n",

These\nrarely-crossed streams of research leave open the possibility that the FCI may\nnot be structurally valid across genders, particularly since many reported\nresults come from calculus-based courses where 75% or more of the students are\nmen. We examine the FCI considering both psychometrics and gender\ndisaggregation (while acknowledging this as a binary simplification), and find\nseveral problematic questions whose removal decreases the apparent gender gap.\nWe analyze three samples (total $N_{pre}=5,391$, $N_{post}=5,769$) looking for\ngender asymmetries using Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and\nDifferential Item Functioning. The combination of these methods highlights six\nitems that appear substantially unfair to women and two items biased in favor\nof women. No single physical concept or prior experience unifies these\nquestions, but they are broadly consistent with problematic items identified in\nprevious research. Removing all significantly gender-unfair items halves the\ngender gap in the main sample in this study. We recommend that instructors\nusing the FCI report the reduced-instrument score as well as the 30-item score,\nand that credit or other benefits to students not be assigned using the biased\nitems.\n",

In the program, students focus on improving\ntheir metacognitive skills and cultural preparation for college life within a\ncontext of model building. We use three methods to measure equity. First, we\nlook at speaking time: who talks, when, and to whom. Second, we look to segment\nstudent discourse by analyzing consistency of group speaking time. Third, we\nanalyze group equality over time changes. We analyze these methods to see how\neffective they are at capturing equity in group discourse.\n",

However, the\nuse of these assessments to evaluate student learning is only productive if\nthey continue to align with our learning goals. Recently, there have been calls\nto elevate the process of science (\"scientific practices\") to the same level of\nimportance and emphasis as the concepts of physics (\"core ideas\" and\n\"crosscutting concepts\"). We use the recently developed 3D-LAP to investigate\nhow well the most commonly used standardized assessments in introductory\nphysics (i.e. concept inventories) align with this modern understanding of\nphysics education's learning goals. We find that many of the questions on\nconcept inventories do elicit evidence of student understanding of core ideas,\nbut do not have the potential to elicit evidence of scientific practices or\ncrosscutting concepts. Furthermore, we find that the individual scientific\npractices and crosscutting concepts that are assessed using these tools are\nlimited to a select few. We discuss the implications that these findings have\non designing and testing curricula and instruction both in the past and for the\nfuture.\n",

However, these\nquantities are not covered by human (visual) perception and thus, an intuitive\nunderstanding often is lacking. Today immersive technologies like head-mounted\ndisplays of the newest generation, especially HoloLens, allow for high quality\naugmented reality learning experiences, which can overcome this perception gap\nand simultaneously avoid a split attention effect. In a mixed reality (MR)\nscenario as presented in this paper---which we call a holo.lab---human\nperception can be extended to the thermal regime by presenting false-color\nrepresentations of the temperature of objects as a virtual augmentation\ndirectly on the real object itself in real-time. Direct feedback to\nexperimental actions of the users in form of different representations allows\nfor immediate comparison to theoretical principles and predictions and\ntherefore is supposed to intensify the theory-experiment interactions and to\nincrease the conceptual understanding. We tested this technology for an\nexperiment on thermal conduction of metals in the framework of undergraduate\nlaboratories. A pilot study with treatment and control groups (N = 59) showed a\nsmall positive effect of MR on students' performance measured with a\nstandardized concept test for thermodynamics, indicating an improvement of the\nunderstanding of the underlying physical concepts.\n",

        "summary": "  One of the most important debates is currently focusing on specifying the\ntraining that university teachers must receive for their professional practice.\nImproving it in higher education is extremely important not only for the\nscientific production generated by university but also for the adequacy of the\ntraining that future graduates will be offered; professionals facing an\nincreasingly demanding labour market with new needs. University teachers\ntraining, thus, should be a priority in academic policies due to their\ninfluence and the role played in the evolution of society, as well as being the\nbasis of the quality of Higher Education. This research, a case study in the\nState of Goias (Brazil), is focused on a sample of practicing university\nteachers from different fields of knowledge, and has as main objective to know\nthe characteristics of the training received for their professional practice,\nboth in the field of scientific education and their educational role and\nability to transfer knowledge. The methodology used has been mixed, not\nexperimental and descriptive, with the help of instruments for data collection\nand analysis of quantitative and qualitative nature (questionnaires,\ninterviews, monitoring, checklists, documentary analysis, etc.). The results\nconfirmed the initial hypothesis, which stated that university teachers current\ntraining is primarily scientific and technical, and has gaps in the teacher\ntraining required today for a more effective work in the classroom. In this\narea teachers often use teaching methodologies supported by previous\nexperiences with traditional features. Finally, to optimize this situation,\ndifferent strategies for university teachers training are proposed seeking to\nimprove both their reflection and teaching practice.\n",

As such, forums can build classroom community as\nwell as aid learning, but students do not always take up these tools. We use\nnetwork analysis to compare three semesters of forum logs from an introductory\ncalculus-based physics course. The networks show dense structures of\ncollaboration that differ significantly between semesters, even though\naggregate participation statistics remain steady. After characterizing network\nstructure for each semester, we correlate centrality with final course grade.\nFinally, we use a backbone extraction procedure to clean up \"noise\" in the\nnetwork and clarify centrality/grade correlations. We find that network\ncentrality is positively linked with course success in the two semesters with\ndenser forum networks, and is a more reliable indicator than non-network\nmeasures such as post count. Backbone extraction destroys these correlations,\nsuggesting that the \"noise\" is in fact signal and further analysis of the\ndiscussion transcripts is required.\n",

Multi-Dimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) provides an\nalternative to traditional Exploratory Factor Analysis which allows statistical\ntesting to identify the optimal number of factors. Application of MIRT to a\nsample of $N=4,716$ FCI post-tests identified a 9-factor solution as optimal.\nAdditional analysis showed that a substantial part of the identified factor\nstructure resulted from the practice of using problem blocks and from pairs of\nsimilar questions. Applying MIRT to a reduced set of FCI items removing blocked\nitems and repeated items produced a 6-factor solution; however, the factors had\nlittle relation the general structure of Newtonian mechanics. A theoretical\nmodel of the FCI was constructed from expert solutions and fit to the FCI by\nconstraining the MIRT parameter matrix to the theoretical model. Variations on\nthe theoretical model were then explored to identify an optimal model. The\noptimal model supported the differentiation of Newton's 1st and 2nd law; of\none-dimensional and three-dimensional kinematics; and of the principle of the\naddition of forces from Newton's 2nd law. The model suggested by the authors of\nthe FCI was also fit; the optimal MIRT model was statistically superior.\n",

The conceptual systems\nphysicists use to think about nature are made from many different resources,\nformal and not, working together and inextricably linked. By blending\nmathematical forms and physical intuition, physicists breathe meaning into the\nequations they use. In contrast, in physics class, novice students often treat\nmathematics as only a calculational tool, isolating it from their rich\nknowledge of the physical world. We are interested in cases where students\nbreak that pattern by reading, manipulating, and building equations\nmeaningfully rather than purely formally. To find examples of this and explore\nthe diversity of ways students combine formal and intuitive resources, we\nconducted problem-solving interviews with students in an introductory physics\nfor life sciences class. During the interviews, we scaffolded student use of\nstrategies which call for both formal and intuitive reasoning, such as \"examine\nthe extreme cases\". We use the analytic framework of epistemic games to model\nhow students used the strategies and how they accessed problem-solving\nresources, and we present evidence that novice students using these strategies\naccessed more expert-like conceptual systems than those typically described in\nproblem-solving literature. They blended physical intuition with mathematical\nsymbolic templates, reconceptualized the nature of equations, and distinguished\nsimilar functional forms. Once introduced to a strategy, students applied it to\nnew scenarios and found new types of uses for it, acknowledging it as a useful,\ngeneral purpose problem-solving technique. Our data suggests that these\nstrategies can potentially help novice students learn to develop and apply\ntheir physical intuition more effectively.\n",

        "summary": "  One of the objectives of the undergraduate physics curriculum is for students\nto become aware of the connections between the fundamental principles of\nclassical physics and their personal experience. Nonetheless, numerous studies\nhave shown that students' awareness of such connections tends to deteriorate,\nsometimes substantially, following instruction. In this work, which constitutes\nthe first analysis of the effects of contemplative practices on the learning\nexperience in undergraduate physics courses, we present two practices aimed at\nintegrating formal theory with students' personal, embodied experience: a\nsensory meditation and a contemplative videography. In written reflections on\ntheir experiences with the practices, the students expressed suddenly becoming\naware of countless manifestations of formal physics principles in their\nsurroundings, in an important step toward establishing firm connections between\nthe abstract and the experiential. Furthermore, the students reported\nexperiencing a sense of physical embodiment, heightened sensory awareness,\nsomatic relaxation, and mental stillness, in significant contrast to their\ntypical experience. Students also described experiencing insight about the\nessential role of observation in the scientific endeavor, a reawakened sense of\ncuriosity, an intrinsic motivation to understand the observed physical\nphenomena, and a deepened awareness of their cognitive and emotional processes.\n",

This paper presents a summary of how NITARP works\nand the lessons learned over the last 13 years. The program lasts a calendar\nyear, January to January, and involves three ~week-long trips: to the American\nAstronomical Society (AAS) winter meeting, to Caltech in the summer (with\nstudents), and back to a winter AAS meeting (with students) to present their\nresults. Because NITARP has been running since 2009, and its predecessor ran\nfrom 2005-2008, there have been many lessons learned over the last 13 years\nthat have informed the development of the program. The most critical is that\nscientists must see their work with the educators on their team as a\npartnership of equals who have specialized in different professions. NITARP\nteams appear to function most efficiently with approximately 5 people: a mentor\nastronomer, a mentor teacher (who has been through the program before), and 3\nnew educators. Educators are asked to step into the role of learner and develop\ntheir question-asking skills as they work to develop an understanding of a\nsubject in which they will not have command of all the information and\nprocesses needed. Critical to the success of each team is the development of\ncommunication skills and fluid plan of action to keep the lines of\ncommunication open. This program has allowed more than 100 educators to present\nmore than 60 total science posters at the AAS.\n",

We\ninvestigate a sample population of 218 students in a first-semester\nintroductory algebra-based physics course, drawn from 14 laboratory sections\nwithin six semesters of course sections, to determine the influence of\nachievement goals on life science majors' attitudes towards physics. Learning\norientations that, respectively, pertain to mastery goals and performance\ngoals, in addition to a learning orientation that does not report a performance\ngoal, were recorded from students in the specific context of learning a\nproblem-solving framework during an in-class exercise. Students' learning\norientations, defined within the context of students' self-reported statements\nin the specific context of a problem-solving-related research-based course\nimplementation, are compared to pre-post results on physics problem-solving\nitems in a well-established attitudinal survey instrument, in order to\nestablish the categories' validity. In addition, mastery-related and\nperformance-related orientations appear to extend to overall pre-post\nattitudinal shifts, but not to force and motion concepts or to overall course\ngrade, within the scope of an introductory physics course. There also appears\nto be differentiation regarding overall course performance within health\nscience majors, but not within biology majors, in terms of learning\norientations; however, health science majors generally appear to fare less well\non all measurements in the study than do biology majors, regardless of learning\norientations.\n",

To provide transparency and create a nuanced\npicture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two\ncompeting operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality\nof Learning. These two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used\nhierarchical linear models to examine student's conceptual learning as measured\nby gains in scores on research-based assessments administered as pretests and\nposttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO)\nnational database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first-semester\ncollege physics courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across\ngender and race. Large gender differences existed for White and Hispanic\nstudents but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students. The models\npredicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in\nlecture-based courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated\nthat collaborative instruction improved equity because all groups learned more\nwith collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning operationalization\nindicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because\ndifferences between groups were unaffected.

Many existing frameworks describe modeling in science education\nat introductory levels. However, most have limited applicability to the context\nof upper-division physics lab courses or experimental physics. Here, we discuss\nthe Modeling Framework for Experimental Physics, a theoretical framework\ntailored to labs and experimentation. A key feature of the Framework is\nrecursive interaction between models and apparatus. Models are revised to\naccount for new evidence produced by apparatus, and apparatus are revised to\nbetter align with the simplifying assumptions of models. Another key feature is\nthe distinction between the physical phenomenon being investigated and the\nmeasurement equipment used to conduct the investigation. Models of physical\nsystems facilitate explanation or prediction of phenomena, whereas models of\nmeasurement systems facilitate interpretation of data. We describe the\nFramework, provide a chronological history of its development, and summarize\nits applications to research and curricular design. Ultimately, we argue that\nthe Modeling Framework is a theoretically sound and well-tested tool that is\napplicable to multiple physics domains and research purposes. In particular, it\nis useful for characterizing students' approaches to experimentation, designing\nor evaluating curricula for lab courses, and developing instruments to assess\nstudents' experimental modeling skills.\n",

Sure,\nwhen we couple things together, everything turns disgusting, and we need to\nturn to really powerful computers or simulators to get a lot accomplished. But\nthe basic rules are not that bad. My hope is to provide enough of a conceptual\nframework for you to learn to $read$ math as I saw a lot of other physicists do\nwhen I started my undergraduate career. I plan to cover some of the topics that\ntend to trip up a lot of physics students, although I could not cover these\nexhaustively. When I found that I should have covered more, but could not due\nto finite time constraints, I left a reference to other work that I think you\nmay find helpful. However, unlike a lot of works, my focus is to help modify\nyour thinking of how math is used, rather than just pummel you with algorithms\nfor you to memorize without giving you the proper context for such algorithms.\nWhenever you find my explanations long-winded, feel free to proceed through\nfaster.

As part of a larger effort to create assessments of\nstudents' modeling abilities in the context of upper-division electronics\ncourses, we used the Modeling Framework to develop and code think-aloud\nproblem-solving activities centered on troubleshooting an inverting amplifier\ncircuit. We observed that some participants iteratively and continuously made\nmeasurements and revisions if they could not immediately propose a cause for an\nobserved discrepancy.

In our experiment we have used two\nmodes of a single oscillator to demonstrate normal modes, as opposed to two\nsingle oscillators used in standard setups of two-dimensional pendulums.\nBreaking of the cylindrical symmetry of the pendulum is achieved by attaching a\nspring in the suspension. This leads to interesting visual patterns in the\nmotion, wherein the plane of the oscillator shifts with time, the motion then\nbecomes elliptical, shifts back again to planar, before finally returning to\nplanar motion in the original plane. The symmetry breaking leads to\nnon-degenerate normal modes of oscillation, whose interplay gives rise to the\nobserved motion patterns. This also explains why for a real pendulum, the plane\nof motion always shifts, unlike the ideal two-dimensional pendulum where the\nplane of oscillation is supposed to remain fixed. This curious fact also\ncontributes to the difficulties involved in building a Foucault's pendulum,\nwhere the plane of rotation due to Coriolis force needs to be accurately\nmeasured. The strength of the symmetry breaking in our system can be quantified\nby a parameter the \"return time\", which is defined as the time over which the\npendulum returns to its original motion pattern. We propose this setup as a\npedagogical tool to introduce the concepts of normal modes and symmetry\nbreaking in a physics laboratory. The motion patterns that emerge have a high\nvisual impact and we have also described in detail the quantitative\nobservations can be made with this setup.\n",

To this end, we\nconducted an exploratory quantitative investigation to look for connections\nbetween students' pre-project views about experimental physics and their\npost-project sense of project ownership. We administered the Colorado Learning\nAttitudes About Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) and the\nProject Ownership Survey (POS) to 96 students enrolled in 6 lab courses at 5\nuniversities. E-CLASS and POS scores were positively correlated, suggesting\nthat students' views about experimentation may be linked to their ownership of\nprojects. This finding motivates future studies that could explore whether\nthese constructs are causally related.\n",

The rise of problem based\nlearning approaches are testimonial to the importance of such skills at all\nlevels of education from early childhood to graduate school level.

We compare understanding and attitudes\nthrough pre and post testing on four age groups (school years 7, 8, 9 and 10),\nand compare results with those of longer interventions with Year 9.

We then present analysis of a dataset from 112\nintroductory physics courses using both multiple linear regression and\nhierarchical linear modeling to illustrate the potential impact of using an\ninappropriate analytical method on PER findings and implications. Research can\nleverage multi-institutional datasets to improve the field's understanding of\nhow to support student success in physics. There is no post hoc fix, however,\nif researchers use inappropriate single-level models to analyze multi-level\ndatasets. To continue developing reliable and generalizable knowledge, PER\nshould use hierarchical models when analyzing hierarchical datasets. The\nsupplemental materials include a sample dataset, R code to model the building\nand analysis presented in the paper, and an HTML output from the R code.\n",

The courses\nincluded in the study are intermediate Classical Mechanics, introductory\nQuantum Mechanics, and intermediate Electromagnetism. By correlating these\nnodal centrality measures with students' scores on homework and exams, we find\nfour centrality measures that correlate significantly with students' homework\nscores in all three courses: in-strength, out-strength, closeness centrality,\nand harmonic centrality. These correlations suggest that students who not only\ncollaborate often, but also collaborate significantly with many different\npeople tend to achieve higher grades. Centrality measures between simultaneous\ncollaboration networks (analytical vs. numerical homework collaboration)\ncomposed of the same students also correlate with each other, suggesting that\nstudents' collaboration strategies remain relatively stable when presented with\nhomework assignments targeting different skills. Additionally, we correlate\ncentrality measures between collaboration networks from different courses and\nfind that the four centrality measures with the strongest relationship to\nstudents' homework scores are also the most stable measures across networks\ninvolving different courses. Correlations of centrality measures with exam\nscores were generally smaller than the correlations with homework scores,\nthough this finding varied across courses.\n",

Findings showed that entrepreneurs need\ndifferent mentoring support and skills when they go through each phase of their\nentrepreneurial career.

To test this possibility, we compared the\naccuracy of complete-case analysis and multiple imputation (MI) using simulated\ndata. We simulated the data based on prior studies such that students who\nearned higher grades participated at higher rates, which made the data missing\nat random (MAR). PER studies seldom use MI, but MI uses all available data, has\nless stringent assumptions, and is more accurate and more statistically\npowerful than complete-case analysis. Results indicated that complete-case\nanalysis introduced more bias than MI and this bias was large enough to obscure\ndifferences between student populations or between courses.

We collected social network data\nby periodically asking students to list the names of peers with whom they had\nmeaningful interactions.

Moseley's law --- an\nempirical relation first described by Moseley in 1913 which supported\npredictions of the then-new Bohr model of atomic energy levels while\nsimultaneously identifying the integer atomic number $Z$ as the measure of\nnuclear charge --- predicts that the energy of these characteristic x rays\nscales as $Z^2$. The foundational nature of Moseley's experiment has led to the\npopularity of Moseley's law measurements in undergraduate advanced laboratory\nphysics courses. We report here observations of deviations from Moseley's law\nin the characteristic $K_{\\alpha}$ x-ray emission of 13 elements ranging from\n$Z=29$ to $Z=92$. %: Cu, Rb, Mo, Ag, In, Ba, Tb, Ta, W, Pb, Au, Pt, and U.\nWhile following the square-law predictions of the Bohr model fairly well at low\n$Z$, the deviations become larger with increasing $Z$ (negligible probability\nof the Bohr model fitting data by a $\\chi^2$ test). We find that relativistic\nmodels of atomic structure are necessary to fit the full range of atomic\nnumbers observed (probability value of $0.20$ for the relativistic\nBohr-Sommerfeld model). As has been argued by previous authors, measurements of\nthe relativistic deviations from Moseley's law are both pedagogically valuable\nat the advanced laboratory level and accessible with modern but modest\napparatus. Here, we show that this pedagogical value can be be extended even\nfurther --- to higher $Z$ elements, where the effects are more dramatically\nobservable --- using apparatus which is enhanced relative to more modest\nversions, but nevertheless still accessible for many teaching laboratories.\n",

One end of each\npasta was fixed while the other end was submitted to forces perpendicular to\nthe line determined by the pasta when undeflected. Elastic curves were studied,\nresulting in values of $E=2.60$ GPa and $E=2.26$ GPa for the Young's modulus of\nbucatini and noodles respectively. The relation coming from small slopes\napproximation between the free end's displacement and the load was analyzed,\nresulting in values of $E=2.33$ GPa and $E=2.44$ GPa for the Young's modulus of\nbucatini and noodles respectively. Mechanical hysteresis was found in the\npasta, resulting in a small deformation. This experiment can be done with low\ncost materials and it is a good first introduction to some basic concepts of\nelasticity for mechanics courses.\n",

Physics departments and their faculty are\nincreasingly recognizing the importance of teaching computation to their\nstudents. We recently completed a national survey of faculty in physics\ndepartments to understand the state of computational instruction and the\nfactors that underlie that instruction. The data collected from the faculty\nresponding to the survey included a variety of scales, binary questions, and\nnumerical responses. We then used Random Forest, a supervised learning\ntechnique, to explore the factors that are most predictive of whether a faculty\nmember decides to include computation in their physics courses. We find that\nexperience using computation with students in their research, or lack thereof\nand various personal beliefs to be most predictive of a faculty member having\nexperience teaching computation. Interestingly, we find demographic and\ndepartmental factors to be less useful factors in our model. The results of\nthis study inform future efforts to promote greater integration of computation\ninto the physics curriculum as well as comment on the current state of\ncomputational instruction across the United States.\n",

Instead if we consider two\ndimensional spatial signals, the convolution and correlation operations can be\nvery clearly explained. In this paper, we propose a lecture demonstration of\nconvolution and correlation between two spatial signals using the Fourier\ntransform tool. Both simulation and optical experiments are possible using a\nvariety of object transparencies. The demonstration experiments help to clearly\nexplain the similarity and the difference between convolution and correlation\noperations. This method of teaching using simulation and hands-on experiments\ncan stimulate the curiosity of the students. The feedback of the students, in\nmy class teaching, has been quite encouraging.\n",

To this end,\nresearchers often conduct studies to measure the effect of classroom\ninterventions on student learning outcomes. Many of these intervention studies\nhave provided an empirical foundation of reformed teaching techniques, such as\nactive engagement. However, many times there is not sufficient evidence to\nconclude that the intervention had the intended effect, and these null results\noften end up in the file drawer. In this paper, we argue that null results can\ncontribute significantly to physics education research, even if the results are\nnot statistically significant. First, we review social sciences and biomedical\nresearch that has found widespread publication bias against null results,\nexploring why it occurs and how it can hurt the field. We then present three\ncases from physics education research to highlight how studies that yield null\nresults can contribute to our understanding of teaching and learning. Finally,\nwe distill from these studies some general principles for learning from null\nresults, proposing that we should evaluate them not on whether they reject the\nnull hypothesis, but according to their potential for generating new\nunderstanding.\n",

The following experiment serves to clearly demonstrate the\ntransition from rolling with slipping to rolling without slipping. In the\nexperiment, a rotating bicycle wheel was placed in contact with a horizontal\nsurface and the wheel in motion was tracked using Tracker video analysis\nsoftware [8]. The software created linear velocity plots for the centre of mass\nand a point on the circumference as well as a plot of the angular velocity of\nthe rotating wheel. The time evolution plots created by Tracker clearly\nillustrate the transition between the two types of motion.\n",

In this paper we explore how students understand and apply\nconcepts of rotating frames of reference in the context of an exemplary lecture\ndemonstration experiment. We found in a $Predict-Observe-Explain$-setting, that\nafter predicting the outcome prior to the demonstration, only one out of five\nphysics students correctly reported the observation of the trajectory of a\nsphere rolling over a rotating disc. Despite this low score, a detailed\nanalysis of distractors revealed significant conceptual learning during the\nobservation of the experiment. In this context, we identified three main\nmisconceptions and learning difficulties. First, the centrifugal force is only\nrequired to describe the trajectory if the object is coupled to the rotating\nsystem. Second, inertial forces cause a reaction of an object on which they\nact. And third, students systematically mix-up the trajectories in the\nstationary and the rotating frame of reference. Furthermore, we captured\nstudents' eye movements during the $Predict$ task and found that physics\nstudents with low confidence ratings focused longer on relevant task areas than\nconfident students despite having a comparable score. Consequently, this metric\nis a helpful tool for the identification of misconceptions using eye tracking.\nOverall, the results help to understand the complexity of concept learning from\ndemonstration experiments and provide important implications for instructional\ndesign of introductions to rotating frames of reference.\n",

Some interviewing techniques use co-creation of\nan artifact, such as a personal timeline, as a unique way to elicit a detailed\nnarrative from a respondent. The purpose of this commentary is to describe an\ninterview artifact called a life grid. First used and validated in medical\nsociology to conduct life course research, we adapted the life grid for use in\nresearch on undergraduate STEM education. We applied the life grid interview\ntechnique to two contexts: 1) students in an advance degree program reflecting\non their entire undergraduate career as a biology major, and 2) students in an\nundergraduate physics program reflecting on a multi-week lab project.\n  Results: We found that the life grid supported four important attributes of\nan interview: facilitation of the respondents' agency, establishment of rapport\nbetween interviewers and respondents, enhanced depth of the respondents'\nnarratives, and the construction of more accurate accounts of events. We\nsituate our experiences with respect to those attributes and compare them with\nthe experiences detailed in literature.\n  Conclusions: We conclude with recommendations for future use of the life grid\ntechnique in undergraduate STEM education research.

We propose that mathematical sensemaking, the practice of seeking\ncoherence between formal mathematics and conceptual understanding, is a key\ntarget of successful physics problem-solving instruction. However, typical\nassessments tend to measure understanding in more disjoint ways. To capture\ncoherence-seeking practices in student problem solving, we introduce an\nassessment framework that highlights opportunities to use these problem-solving\napproaches more flexibly. Three assessment items embodying this\ncalculation-concept crossover framework illustrate how coherence can drive\nflexible problem-solving approaches that may be more efficient, insightful, and\naccurate. These three assessment items were used to evaluate the efficacy of an\ninstructional approach focused on developing mathematical-sensemaking skills.\nIn a quasi-experimental study, three parallel lecture sections of\nfirst-semester, introductory physics were compared: two mathematical\nsensemaking sections, with one having an experienced instructor (MS) and one a\nnovice instructor (MS-nov), and a traditionally-taught section acted as a\ncontrol group (CTRL). On the three crossover assessment items, mathematical\nsensemaking students used calculation-concept crossover approaches more and\ngenerated more correct solutions than CTRL students. Student surveyed\nepistemological views toward problem-solving coherence at the end of the course\npredicted their crossover approach use but did not fully account for the\ndifferences in crossover approach use between the MS and CTRL groups. These\nresults illustrate new instructional and assessment frameworks for research on\nmathematical sensemaking and adaptive problem-solving expertise.\n",

Two\nrelatively common numerical scales used to specify individual grades are the\n4-point scale (where each whole number 0-4 corresponds to a letter grade) and\nthe percent scale (where letter grades A through D are uniformly distributed in\nthe top 40% of the scale). This paper uses grading data from a single series of\ncourses offered over a period of 10 years to show that the grade distributions\nemerging from these two grade scales differed in many ways from each other.\nEvidence suggests that the differences are due more to the grade scale than to\neither the students or the instructors. One major difference is that the\nfraction of students given grades less than C- was over 5 times larger when\ninstructors used the percent scale. The fact that each instructor who used both\ngrade scales gave more than 4 times as many of these low grades under percent\nscale grading suggests that the effect is due to the grade scale rather than\nthe instructor. When the percent scale was first introduced in these courses in\n2006, one of the authors of this paper, who is also one of the instructors in\nthis data set, had confidently predicted that any changes in course grading\nwould be negligible. They were not negligible, even for this instructor.\n",

To understand\nthese trends, it is important to consider the context in which students make\ndecisions about which university courses to enrol in. The current study seeks\nto investigate gender differences in STEM through a unique approach that\ncombines network analysis of student enrolment data with an interpretive lens\nbased on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of\ncourses taken by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014)\nto quantify Bourdieu's concept of field. We explore the properties of this\nnetwork to investigate gender differences in transverse movements (between\ndifferent academic fields) and vertical movements (changes in students'\nachievement rankings within a field). Our findings indicate that female\nstudents are more likely to make transverse movements into life science fields.\nWe also find that university physics does a poor job in attracting high\nachieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the\nstudents who do choose to study physics, low achieving female students are less\nlikely to continue than their male counterparts. The results and implications\nare discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory, and previous research. We\nargue that in order to remove constraints on female student's study choices,\nthe field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like\nthey belong.\n",

In the present paper we demonstrate how this pedagogical\nprerogative can inform the design of an experiment involving an\naccelerometer-equipped smartphone rotating uniformly in a horizontal plane.\nSpecifically, the location of the sensor itself within the body of the\nsmartphone will be determined using a technique that is purely geometrical in\nnature, relying on nothing more than the notion that centripetal accelerations\nare centrally-pointing. The complete absence of algebraic manipulations obliges\nstudents to focus exclusively on the development of their geometrical reasoning\nabilities. In particular, it provides a healthy challenge for those\nalgebraically-accomplished students for whom equations, calculations and data\ntables represent a means of avoiding a direct confrontation with the imposing\nspectre of material that is otherwise purely conceptual in nature.\n",

We have found that the results are\nsurprisingly consistent across the institutions, with the only two variables\nthat have predictive power being math SAT/ACT scores and concept inventory\npre-scores. The importance of both variables is comparable and fairly similar\nacross the institutions. They explain 20 - 30 percent of the variation in\nstudents' performance on the final exam. Most notably, the demographic\nvariables (gender, under-represented minority, first generation to attend\ncollege) are not significant. In all cases, although there appear to be gaps in\nexam performance if one considers only the demographic variable, once these two\nproxies of incoming preparation are included in the model, there is no longer a\ndemographic gap. There is only a preparation gap that applies equally across\nthe entire student population. This work shows that to properly understand\ndifferences in student performance across a diverse population, and hence to\ndesign more effective instruction, it is important to do statistical analyses\nthat take multiple variables into account. It also illustrates the importance\nof having measures that are sensitive to both subject specific and more general\npreparation. The results suggest that better matching of the course design and\nteaching to the incoming student preparation will likely be the most effective\nway to eliminate observed performance gaps across demographic groups while also\nimproving the success of all students.\n",

The case for novelty is argued through an\nempirical, comparative analysis on three sets of data: conjecture data, data\nfrom an exam for screening talented students for a competitive event (two\nexamples), and data from an international competitive academic event. The\nscheme is developed to handle the data gathered from different question formats\nsuch as MCQs, Long answer questions (LAQs) and a combination of these two\nquestion formats. A code has been developed for carrying out computational\nanalysis on large data sets. A comparison with the conventional approach to\ndata analysis establishes the worthiness of ideas proposed for making\nmeaningful inferences and simultaneously renders it possible to attend to\nnuances that are greatly compromised while analyzing huge data-sets. The paper\nbrings a critical value-addition to the body of analytical knowledge building.\n",

With these photographs we are able to calculate the distance between\nSun and Earth at different dates in a period of time of about three months.\nThese distances allow us to obtain the correct elliptical orbit of Earth,\nproving the Kepler's first law.\n  The analysis of the data extracted from photographs is performed by using an\nanalytical optimization approach that allow us to find the parameters of the\nelliptical orbit. Also, it is shown that the five data points fit an ellipse\nusing an geometrical scheme. The obtained parameters are in very good agreement\nwith the ones for Earth's orbit, allowing us to foresee the future positions of\nEarth along its trajectory. The parameters for the orbit are used to calculate\nthe Sun's mass by applying the Kepler's third law and Newton's law for\ngravitation. This method gives a result wich is in excellent agreement with the\ncorrect value for the Sun's mass. Thus, in a span of time of about three\nmonths, any student is capable to calculate the mass of the sun with only five\nphotographs, a telescope and a camera.\n",

In this\ninvestigation, we examined the views of physics graduate teaching assistants\n(TAs) about the instructional benefits of different types of introductory\nproblems based upon the same problem scenario. Here we report on TAs' views\nabout two of these problem types that were regarded by TAs as the least\ninstructionally beneficial of all problem types--the context rich and\nmultiple-choice formats. Many TAs listed no pros at all for these problem\ntypes, despite being explicitly asked for at least one pro. They viewed\nmultiple-choice questions nearly exclusively as tools for high-stakes summative\nassessment rather than their possible use as formative assessment tools, e.g.,\nas clicker questions even in large classes. Similarly, TAs viewed context-rich\nproblems as overly challenging, unnecessarily wordy, and too time-consuming to\nbe instructionally beneficial to their students. While TAs' concerns have\nobvious validity and value, the benefits of well-designed multiple-choice\nquestions as a formative assessment tool was not readily identified by them,\nnor did the TAs recognize the learning benefits associated with solving\ncontext-rich problems. Given the powerful ways multiple-choice and context-rich\nproblems can be used for active engagement and formative assessment in\ndifferent instructional contexts to meet diverse instructional goals, the lack\nof enthusiasm for these types of problems has implications for future TA\nprofessional development programs.\n",

Until recently, RBAs were given to\nstudents exclusively on paper and in-class; however, this approach has\nimportant drawbacks including decentralized data collection and the need to\nsacrifice class time. Recently, some RBAs have been moved to online platforms\nto address these limitations. Yet, online RBAs present new concerns such as\nstudent participation rates, test security, and students' use of outside\nresources. Here, we report on a study addressing these concerns in both\nupper-division and lower-division undergraduate physics courses. We gave RBAs\nto courses at five institutions; the RBAs were hosted online and featured\nembedded JavaScript code which collected information on students' behaviors\n(e.g., copying text, printing). With these data, we examine the prevalence of\nthese behaviors, and their correlation with students' scores, to determine if\nonline and paper-based RBAs are comparable. We find that browser loss of focus\nis the most common online behavior while copying and printing events were\nrarer. We found that correlations between these behaviors and student\nperformance varied significantly between introductory and upper-division\nstudent populations, particularly with respect to the impact of students\ncopying text in order to utilize internet resources. However, while the\nmajority of students engaged in one or more of the targeted online behaviors,\nwe found that, for our sample, none of these behaviors resulted in a\nsignificant change in the population's average performance that would threaten\nour ability to interpret this performance or compare it to paper-based\nimplementations of the RBA.\n",

However, it is important to ensure that all students are\nbenefiting from the labs equally and have a positive growth trajectory. Through\ninterviews and reflexive ethnographic observations, we identify and analyze two\ncommon modes of work that may disadvantage female students in introductory\nphysics labs. Students who adopt the Secretary archetype are relegated to\nrecording and analyzing data, and thus miss out on much of the opportunity to\ngrow their physics and science identities by engaging fully in the experimental\nwork. Meanwhile, students in the Hermione mode shoulder a disproportionate\namount of managerial work, and also do not get adequate opportunity to engage\nwith different aspects of the experimental work that are essential for helping\nthem develop their physics and science identities. Using a physics identity\nframework, we analyze interviews and observational data to investigate how\nstudents under these modes of work may experience stunted growth in their\nphysics and science identity trajectories in their physics lab course. This\nstunted growth then perpetuates and reinforces societal stereotypes and biases\nabout who does physics. This categorization not only gives a vocabulary to\ndiscussions about equity in the lab, but can also serve as a useful touchstone\nfor those who seek to center equity in efforts to transform physics\ninstruction.\n",

A total of N =\n115 upper-secondary-level students from Germany and Switzerland took the\n26-item multiple-choice instrument after learning about kinematics graphs in\nthe regular classroom. Besides choosing the correct alternative among\nresearch-based distractors, the students were required to judge their response\nconfidence for each question. The items were presented sequentially on a\ncomputer screen equipped with a remote eye tracker, resulting in a set of\napprox. 3000 paired responses (accuracy and confidence) and about 40 hours of\neye movementdata (approx. 500.000 fixations). The analysis of students' visual\nattention related to the item stems (questions) and the item options reveal\nthat high response confidence is correlated with shorter visit duration on both\nelements of the items. While the students' response accuracy and their response\nconfidence are highly correlated on the score level, r(115) = 0.63, p < 0.001,\nthe eye-tracking measures do not sufficiently discriminate between correct and\nincorrect responses. However, a more fine-grained analysis of visual attention\nbased on different answer options reveals a significant discrimination between\ncorrect and incorrect answers in terms of an interaction effect: Incorrect\nresponses are associated with longer visit durations on strong distractors and\nless time spent on correct options while correct responses show the opposite\ntrend.

At the University of\nOslo we have begun development of a new class of assignment called\ncomputational essays to help facilitate creative, open-ended computational\nphysics projects. Computational essays are a type of essay or narrative that\ncombine text and code to express an idea or make an argument, usually written\nin computational notebooks. During a pilot implementation of computational\nessays in an introductory electricity and magnetism course, students reported\nthat computational essays facilitated creative investigation at a variety of\nlevels within their physics course. They also reported finding this creativity\nas being both challenging and motivating. Based on these reflections, we argue\nthat computational essays are a useful tool for leveraging the creative\naffordances of programming in physics education.\n",

Based on an exploratory study of undergraduate physics computational\nliteracy, using a newly-developed teaching tool known as a computational essay,\nwe have identified a variety of student practices, knowledge, and beliefs\nacross these three aspects of computational literacy. We illustrate these\ncategories with data collected from students who engaged in an initial\nimplementation of computational essays in an introductory electricity and\nmagnetism class.

Here, graduate students are considered\nexperts for the introductory level material, as they often take the role of\ninstructor at large research universities. Drawing on work from Research in\nUndergraduate Mathematics Education (RUME), we replicated a study of\nmathematics experts' covariational reasoning done by Hobson and Moore with\nphysics experts [N. L. F. Hobson and K. C. Moore, in RUME Conference\nProceedings, pp. 664-672 (2017)]. We conducted think-aloud interviews with 10\nphysics graduate students using tasks minimally adapted from the mathematics\nstudy. Adaptations were made solely for the purpose of participant\nunderstanding of the question, and validated by preliminary interviews.\nPreliminary findings suggest physics experts approach covariational reasoning\nproblems significantly differently than mathematics experts. In particular, two\nbehaviors are identified in the reasoning of expert physicists that were not\nseen in the mathematics study. We introduce these two behaviors, which we call\nUsing Compiled Relationships and Neighborhood Analysis, and articulate their\ndifferences from the behaviors articulated by Hobson and Moore.

We\npresent results from the survey, which highlight key similarities and\ndifferences in thermal physics content coverage across institutions.

The\nFaraday Effect explains a rotation of a polarized electric field as it\npropagates through a magnetic field. The FRA uses a polarized laser source that\nis coupled into fiber optic cable, then placed in the desired environment to\nmeasure the change of polarization angle caused by the magnetic field. The\nchange in the angle of polarization can be used to then find the strength of\nthe magnetic field and ultimately the level of current that created it. The\nFaraday Effect is amplified by the Verdet Constant, a material property that\ndescribes the number of degrees the angle of polarization rotates for a given\nmedium. The device is intended to measure the current density seen in the\nAurora. Estimated current values are expected to be around the lower micro-amps\nrange (10-100mA/m^2) for that application. The main goals of the project were\nto simulate the Faraday Effect on the propagation of the linear polarized light\nwave, measure the Verdet Constant, re-build the previous design and determine\nwhat components of the design if improved or replaced with newer technology\ncould provide the FRA the required sensitivity.\n",

Recently, researchers have applied network\nanalytic techniques to explore the structure of the incorrect responses to the\nFCI identifying communities of incorrect responses which could be mapped on to\ncommon misconceptions. In this study, the method used to analyze the FCI,\nModified Module Analysis (MMA), was applied to a large sample of FMCE pretest\nand post-test responses ($N_{pre}=3956$, $N_{post}=3719$). The communities of\nincorrect responses identified were consistent with the item groups described\nin previous works. As in the work with the FCI, the network was simplified by\nonly retaining nodes selected by a substantial number of students. Retaining\nnodes selected by 20\\% of the students produced communities associated with\nonly four misconceptions. The incorrect response communities identified for men\nand women were substantially different, as was the change in these communities\nfrom pretest to post-test. The 20% threshold was far more restrictive than the\n4% threshold applied to the FCI in the prior work which generated similar\nstructures. Retaining nodes selected by 5% or 10% of students generated a large\nnumber of complex communities. The communities identified at the 10\\% threshold\nwere generally associated with common misconceptions producing a far richer set\nof incorrect communities than the FCI; this may indicate that the FMCE is a\nsuperior instrument for characterizing the breadth of student misconceptions\nabout Newtonian mechanics.\n",

The\nprediction by the Gartner consulting company that it will take more than ten\nyears from July 2014 onwards for Classroom 3D Printing to reach its Plateau of\nProductivity in one of their hallmark Visibility versus Time (Hype Cycle)\ngraphs is critically assessed. The bibliography of this book chapter sums up\nthe state-of-the art in 3D printing for STEM (including nano-science and\nnano-engineering) education at the college level approximately four years after\nGartner's prediction. Current methodologies and best practices of college-level\nClassroom 3D printing are described in the main section of this review.\nDetailed information is given mainly for those papers in which the authors of\nthis book chapter are authors and co-authors. A straightforward route from\ncrystallographic information framework files (CIFs) at a very large open-access\ndatabase to 3D print files for atomic-level crystal and molecule structure\nmodels is described here in some detail. Because the development of\nmethodologies and best practices are typical activities of the penultimate\nstage of a Hype Cycle, we conclude that (i) Gartner's prediction underestimates\nthe creativity, resourcefulness, and commitment of college educators to their\nstudents and that (ii) Classroom 3D Printing will be a widespread reality\nsignificantly earlier than the middle of the next decade (at least in the USA\nas more than one half of the relevant/quoted papers originated there).

The laboratory and final grades\nof these subjects were compared in four consecutive years. The characteristics\nof all four years were quite similar, except that the traditional teaching\nmethod (TM) was used in two, while FT was applied in the other two. The\nstatistical analysis shows that the academic results of the students were\nbetter in both subjects under FT than those obtained using TM, and that the\ndifference was statistically significant.\n",

For this reason, the teaching of the phenomenon is\nconsidered a key ingredient in the path towards developing critical-thinking\nskills in many secondary science education curricula. Despite being one of the\nbasic concepts in general physics courses, the scientific teaching literature\nof the last 40 years reports a great deal of misconceptions and conceptual\nerrors related to radioactivity that seemingly appear regardless of the\ncontext. This study explores, for the first time, the knowledge status on the\ntopic on a sample of N=191 secondary school students and Y=29\nPhysics-and-Chemistry trainee teachers in the Spanish region of Valencia. To\nthis aim, a revised version of a diagnostic tool developed by Martins\n\\cite{Mar92} has been employed. In general, the results reveal an evolution\nfrom a widespread dissenting notion on the phenomenon, which is staunchly\nrelated to danger, hazard and destruction in the lowest educational levels,\ntowards a more rational, relative and multidimensional perspective in the\nhighest ones. Furthermore, the great overlap of the ideas, emotions and\nattitudes of the inquired individuals with the main misconceptions and\nconceptual mistakes reported in the literature for different educational\ncontexts unveils the urgent need to develop new teaching strategies leading to\na meaningful learning of the associated nuclear science concepts.\n",

On the topic of electrostatics,\nfor example, a large, controlled, randomized study performed by Smith et al.\n2017\\cite{smith17}, found that VR-based instruction had an overall negligible\nimpact on student learning compared to videos or images. However, they did find\na strong trend for students who reported frequent video game play to learn\nbetter from VR than other media. One possible interpretation of this result is\nthat extended videogame play provides a kind of \"training\" that enables a\nstudent to learn more comfortably in the virtual environment. In the present\nwork we consider if a VR training activity that is unrelated to electrostatics\ncan help prepare students to learn electrostatics from subsequent VR\ninstruction. We find that preliminary VR training leads to a small but\nstatistically significant improvement in student performance on our\nelectrostatics assessment.

        "summary": "  One of the objectives of the undergraduate physics curriculum is for students\nto become aware of the connections between formal physical principles and\npersonal experience. However, research has shown that awareness of connections\nbetween the abstract and the experiential tends to deteriorate, sometimes\nsignificantly, following instruction in undergraduate physics courses. Although\nthis phenomenon has been discussed extensively in the literature, few\npedagogical interventions have been designed or implemented to address this\nparticular weakness in undergraduate physics instruction. In this work, we show\nthat a contemplative practice consisting of a somatic meditation and a\ncontemplation deepens students' awareness of the connections between formal\nphysical principles and personal experience by deliberately drawing their\nattention to electromagnetic phenomena in their surroundings. In this process,\nstudents also note interdisciplinary connections between electrodynamic\nprinciples and chemical and biological systems. We also find that the\ncontemplative practice awakens an intrinsic motivation to understand\nelectromagnetic theory, as well as an appreciation for the somatic, affective,\nand cognitive benefits of a contemplative practice.\n",

But given the context of science education, with low\nrecruitment numbers in higher education and poor attitudes towards science, it\nremains a question whether students find the learning of quantum physics\nrelevant. In this study, we explore how students perceive the importance of\nquantum physics and technology and whether their perception changes after an\nintervention, namely the \"Quantum Rules!\" visit. We also aim to understand if\nthey overall feel that learning quantum is relevant or not. In order to answer\nthese questions, we followed a mixed-methods approach, combining both\nquestionnaires and interviews. The quantitative analysis showed that the\n\"Quantum Rules!\" intervention has a positive effect on students' perception of\nthe relevance of quantum physics and technology, especially regarding how\nimportant they feel quantum science is for society. Nevertheless, the\nqualitative information revealed that although students may find quantum\nphysics and technology important for society, that does not necessarily mean\nthat they find learning quantum physics relevant. We found that students\nbelieve the latter is relevant to them only if they find it interesting. We\ntherefore rediscover the common expression \"important, but not for me,\" and we\nfurther propose that this perception derives from students not seeing the\nsocietal relevance of learning quantum physics.\n",

However, there is\nevidence to suggest that people often do not retain all, or even most, of what\nthey learned previously. How much information is retained appears to be\ndependent both on the individuals' approach to learning as well as the style of\ninstruction. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that active engagement\ntechniques in the classroom can improve students' retention of the material\nover time. Here, we report the findings of a longitudinal investigation of\nstudents' retention of conceptual understanding as measured by the Force and\nMotion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) following a first-semester, calculus-based\nintroductory physics course, which features significant active engagement in\nboth lecture and recitation. By administering the FMCE at the end of a\nfirst-semester physics course and again at the beginning of the subsequent\nsecond-semester physics course, we examine students' knowledge retention over\ntime periods ranging from 1-15 months. We find that the shift in students' FMCE\nscores between these two courses is positive but corresponds to a small effect\nsize, indicating that students retained effectively all of their conceptual\nlearning (as measured by the FMCE). This finding largely persists even as the\nlength of the gap between the two courses increases. We also find that, when\nbreaking out students' performance on individual questions, the majority of\nstudents maintain their score on individual questions.

In fact, in both traditionally taught and active learning\nclassroom environments, students often become more novicelike in their\nattitudes and beliefs following a semester of instruction. Further, prior to\ninstruction, men typically score higher than women on conceptual inventories,\nsuch as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), and more expertlike on attitudinal\nsurveys, such as the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS),\nand those gender gaps generally persist following instruction. In this paper,\nwe analyze three years of pre-post matched data for physics majors at Virginia\nTech on the FCI and the CLASS. The courses were taught using a blended\npedagogical model of peer instruction, group problem solving, and direct\ninstruction, along with an explicit focus on the importance of conceptual\nunderstanding and a growth mindset. We found that the FCI gender gap decreased,\nand both men and women showed positive, expertlike shifts on the CLASS. Perhaps\nmost surprisingly, we found a meaningful correlation between a student's post-\nCLASS score and normalized FCI gain for women, but not for men.\n",

        "summary": "  There is a significant underrepresentation of women in many Science,\nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors and careers. Prior\nresearch has shown that self-efficacy can be a critical factor in student\nlearning, and that there is a tendency for women to have lower self-efficacy\nthan men in STEM disciplines. This study investigates gender differences in the\nrelationship between engineering students' self-efficacy and course grades in\nfoundational courses. By focusing on engineering students, we examined these\ngender differences simultaneously in four STEM disciplines (mathematics,\nengineering, physics, and chemistry) among the same population. Using survey\ndata collected longitudinally at three time points and course grade data from\nfive cohorts of engineering students at a large US-based research university,\neffect sizes of gender differences are calculated using Cohen's d on two\nmeasures: responses to survey items on discipline-specific self-efficacy and\ncourse grades in all first-year foundational courses and second-year\nmathematics courses. In engineering, physics, and mathematics courses, we find\nsizeable discrepancies between self-efficacy and performance, with men\nappearing significantly more confident than women despite small or reverse\ndirection differences in grades. In chemistry, women earn higher grades and\nhave higher self-efficacy. The patterns are consistent across courses within\neach discipline. All self-efficacy gender differences close by the fourth year\nexcept physics self-efficacy. The disconnect between self-efficacy and course\ngrades across subjects provides useful clues for targeted interventions to\npromote equitable learning environments. The most extreme disconnect occurs in\nphysics and may help explain the severe underrepresentation of women in\n\"physics-heavy\" engineering disciplines, highlighting the importance of such\ninterventions.\n",

The aims of these interventions are\noften to positively affect students' aspirations towards continuing STEM\neducation and ultimately into STEM-related careers. Most schools engagement\nactivities take the form of short one-off interventions that, while able to\nachieve positive outcomes, are limited in the extent to which they can have\nlasting impacts on aspirations. In this paper we discuss various different\nemerging programmes of repeated interventions with young people, assessing what\nimpacts can realistically be expected. Short series of interventions appear\nalso to suffer some limitations in the types of impacts achievable. However,\ndeeper programmes that interact with both young people and those that influence\nthem over significant periods of time (months to years) seem to be more\neffective in influencing aspirations. We discuss how developing a Theory of\nChange and considering young people's wider learning ecologies are required in\nenabling lasting impacts in a range of areas.

We created four linear regression models correlating students'\npass-fail events in a sequence of online learning modules with their normalized\ntotal course score. Each model takes into account an additional level of\ncontextual information than the previous one, such as student learning strategy\nand duration of assessment attempts. Each of the latter three models is also\naccompanied by a visual representation of students' interaction states on each\nlearning module. We found that the best performing model is the one that\nincludes the most contextual information, including instruction condition,\ninternal condition, and learning strategy. The model shows that while most\nstudents failed on the most challenging learning module, those with normal\nlearning behavior are more likely to obtain higher total course scores, whereas\nstudents who resorted to guessing on the assessments of subsequent modules\ntended to receive lower total scores. Our results suggest that considering more\ncontextual information related to each event can be an effective method to\nimprove the quality of learning analytics, leading to more accurate and\nactionable recommendations for instructors.\n",

However,\none-on-one mentoring is limited by the number of available faculty, and in\ncertain cases also by the availability of funding for stipend. One-on-one\nmentoring is further limited by the selection and self-selection of students.\nSince research positions are often competitive, they are often taken by the\nbest-performing students. More importantly, many students who do not see\nthemselves as the top students of their class, or do not identify themselves as\nresearchers might not apply, and that self selection can have the highest\nimpact on non-traditional students. To address the obstacles of scalability,\nselection, and self-selection, we designed a data science research experience\nfor undergraduates as part of an introductory computer science course.

Results suggest that generating problems is an opportunity for\nstudents to propose ideas and make decisions regarding the goals of the\nproblem, concepts and procedures, contextual details and magnitudes and units\nto introduce in their generated problems. In addition, we found evidence that\ngroups tested the validity of their creations by engaging in strategies often\nobserved with algebra-based physics problems, such as mathematical procedures\nand qualitative descriptions of the physics embedded in the problem, yet groups\ninvested more time with algebra-based strategies compared to more qualitative\ndescriptions.

Through a case study analysis of a collaborative problem solving session\namong four physics students, we investigate how epistemic stances toward group\nwork interact with social dynamics.

The peculiarities of this model\ninclude its use on the basis of child-centric, systemic, activity,\ndifferentiated approaches with the purpose of forming natural and mathematical\nsubject students' competences. An important result of the study is the\njustification of CMODS selection criteria (variability, accessibility, tooling,\ninteractivity, intuition, complexity, data visuality, scientific ground of\nmodels, independence, realism); forms and methods of applying CMODS in the\neducational process, allocating the aspect of cognitive tasks application\n(research, creative, applied) for the students competences formation; the\njustification of such forms of evaluation as reflection, formative evaluation,\nfinal evaluation. Computer modeling systems become an alternative to\nconventional drawings in paper course books and posters. Imitation processes,\ninteractive exercises of various types, animation support as well as formative\nassessment give each student the opportunity of developing competence and\nexploring the world with enthusiasm. The use of CMODS diversifies the process\nof obtaining knowledge, allows transfer from passive to active teaching\nmethods, activates educational and cognitive activity of students, as well as\nthe creation of an individual trajectory for development for each student in\nthe process of studying natural and mathematical subjects.\n",

The majority of the studies on transfer of learning in physics have\nfocused on introductory students. However, compared to advanced students,\nintroductory students have significantly less prior relevant knowledge and\nskills which may be crucial for promoting effective transfer. Here, we examine\nupper-level undergraduate and graduate students' ability to transfer their\nlearning about the concept of \"which-path\" information and its relation to\nwhether or not interference is observed from the context of the Mach Zehnder\nInterferometer (MZI) to a new context of the double-slit experiment (DSE).\nStudents worked through a tutorial on the MZI in which they learned to use the\nconcept of \"which-path\" information to reason about interference of single\nphotons when polarizers with various orientations are placed in one or both\npaths of the MZI. After working on the MZI tutorial, students were asked\nsimilar questions in the isomorphic context of the DSE before any instruction\nabout the DSE and we examined the extent to which transfer of learning about\n\"which-path\" information occurred from the MZI to the DSE context. We find\nevidence suggesting that positive transfer of learning from the MZI to the DSE\noccurred despite the lack of an instructional intervention designed to help\nstudents recognize the similarity between the two contexts. The effectiveness\nof the MZI tutorial in promoting positive transfer of learning from one context\nto another in quantum mechanics sheds light on the expertise of the advanced\nphysics students. Instructors of advanced physics courses can take advantage of\nthe findings presented here which shows the difference between introductory and\nadvanced students' ability to transfer from one context to another.\n",

We explored how these changes\nimpact men's and women's participation in group work associated with labs\nthrough clustering methods on the quantified behavior of students. We compared\nthe group roles students take on in two different types of instructional\nsettings; (1) highly structured traditional labs, and (2) less structured\ninquiry-based labs. Students working in groups in the inquiry-based (less\nstructured) labs assumed different roles within their groups, however men and\nwomen systematically took on different roles and men behaved differently when\nin single- versus mixed-gender groups. We found no such systematic differences\nin role division among male and female students in the traditional\n(highly-structured) labs. Students in the inquiry-based labs were not overtly\nassigned these roles, indicating that the inequitable division of roles was not\na result of explicit assignment. Our results highlight the importance of\nstructuring equitable group dynamics in educational settings, as a gendered\ndivision of roles can emerge without active intervention. As the culture in\nphysics evolves to remove systematic gender biases in the field, instructors in\neducational settings must not only remove explicitly biased aspects of\ncurricula but also take active steps to ensure that potentially discriminatory\naspects are not inadvertently reinforced.\n",

Surprisingly, we found that across\nall experts and fields, the solution process was framed around making a set of\njust twenty-nine specific decisions. We also found that the process of making\nthose discipline-general decisions (selecting between alternative actions)\nrelied heavily on domain-specific predictive models that embodied the relevant\ndisciplinary knowledge. This set of decisions provides a guide for the detailed\nmeasurement and teaching of S & E problem-solving.

Here, based on data recorded with\nthe sensors present in many mobile devices a set of laboratory experiments to\nteach error and uncertainties is proposed. The main aspects addressed are the\nphysical meaning of the mean value and standard deviation, and the\ninterpretation of histograms and distributions. Other activities focus on the\nintensity of the fluctuations in different situations, such as placing the\ndevice on a table or held in the hand in different ways and the number of\nmeasurements in an interval centered on the mean value as a function of the\nwidth expressed in terms of the standard deviation.

In this study, we investigate informal physics programs as\nspaces for physics identity exploration. These programs provide unique\nconditions under which to study physics identity development along with other\nidentities. Informal physics spaces allow for voluntary engagement, as well as\nelements of agency and autonomy within the exploration of physics. Thus these\nspaces allow an identity to form outside of the constraints traditionally found\nin academic settings. In this work, we operationalized the Community of\nPractice (CoP) framework to study the development of physics identities within\nuniversity students who facilitate informal physics programs. We present the\nstories from two physics graduate students out of our sample to provide a\ncontext for testing the feasibility of the extended framework and to identify\nhow experiences within an informal physics program can shape physics identity\ndevelopment. This paper presents the operationalized constructs within the\nCommunity of Practice framework, how these constructs are applied to the\nnarrated experiences of our participants, and highlights how we can use this\nframework to understand the nuances of physics identity development as well as\nthe factors that can influence that development.\n",

One major focus while helping introductory physics students learn effective\nproblem solving is to help them understand that drawing diagrams can facilitate\nproblem solution. We conducted an investigation in which two different\ninterventions were implemented during recitation quizzes in a large enrollment\nalgebra-based introductory physics course. Students were either (i) asked to\nsolve problems in which the diagrams were drawn for them or (ii) explicitly\ntold to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any instruction\nregarding diagrams. We developed rubrics to score the problem solving\nperformance of students in different intervention groups and investigated ten\nproblems. We found that students who were provided diagrams never performed\nbetter and actually performed worse than the other students on three problems,\none involving standing sound waves in a tube (discussed elsewhere) and two\nproblems in electricity which we focus on here. These two problems were the\nonly problems in electricity that involved considerations of initial and final\nconditions, which may partly account for why students provided with diagrams\nperformed significantly worse than students who were not provided with\ndiagrams. In order to explore potential reasons for this finding, we conducted\ninterviews with students and found that some students provided with diagrams\nmay have spent less time on the conceptual analysis and planning stage of the\nproblem solving process. In particular, those provided with the diagram were\nmore likely to jump into the implementation stage of problem solving early\nwithout fully analyzing and understanding the problem, which can increase the\nlikelihood of mistakes in solutions.\n",

Research-validated interactive tutorials that build on\nstudents' prior knowledge can be useful tools to enhance student learning. We\nhave been investigating student difficulties with quantum mechanics pertaining\nto the double-slit experiment in various situations that appear to be\ncounterintuitive and contradict classical notions of particles and waves. For\nexample, if we send single electrons through the slits, they may behave as a\n\"wave\" in part of the experiment and as a \"particle\" in another part of the\nsame experiment. Here we discuss the development and evaluation of a\nresearch-validated Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) which makes\nuse of an interactive simulation to improve student understanding of the\ndouble-slit experiment and strives to help students develop a good grasp of\nfoundational issues in quantum mechanics. We discuss common student\ndifficulties identified during the development and evaluation of the QuILT and\nanalyze the data from the pretest and post test administered to the upper-level\nundergraduate and first-year physics graduate students before and after they\nworked on the QuILT to assess its effectiveness. These data suggest that on\naverage, the QuILT was effective in helping students develop a more robust\nunderstanding of foundational concepts in quantum mechanics that defy classical\nintuition using the context of the double-slit experiment. Moreover, the\nupper-level undergraduates outperformed physics graduate students on the post\ntest. One possible reason for this difference in performance may be the level\nof student engagement with the QuILT due to the grade incentive.

Here, we discuss an investigation of\nstudent difficulties in translating between mathematical and graphical\nrepresentations for a problem in electrostatics and the effect of increasing\nlevels of scaffolding on students' representational consistency. Students in\ncalculus-based introductory physics were given a typical problem that can be\nsolved using Gauss's law involving a spherically symmetric charge distribution\nin which they were asked to write a mathematical expression for the electric\nfield in various regions and then plot the electric field. In study 1, we found\nthat students had great difficulty in plotting the electric field as a function\nof the distance from the center of the sphere consistent with the mathematical\nexpressions in various regions, and interviews with students suggested possible\nreasons which may account for this difficulty. Therefore, in study 2, we\ndesigned two scaffolding interventions with levels of support which built on\neach other (i.e., the second scaffolding level built on the first) in order to\nhelp students plot their expressions consistently and compared the performance\nof students provided with scaffolding with a comparison group which was not\ngiven any scaffolding support. Analysis of student performance with different\nlevels of scaffolding reveals that scaffolding from an expert perspective\nbeyond a certain level may sometimes hinder student performance and students\nmay not even discern the relevance of the additional support.

In the first study, we investigated whether asking\nintroductory physics students to indicate their gender immediately before\ntaking the CSEM increased the gender gap compared to students who were not\nasked for this information. We found no difference in performance between male\nand female students in the two conditions. In the second study, conducted with\nseveral thousand introductory physics students, we investigated the prevalence\nof the belief that men generally perform better in physics than women and the\nextent to which this belief is correlated with the performance of both female\nand male students on the FCI and the CSEM in introductory physics courses. We\nfound that at the end of the year-long calculus-based introductory physics\nsequence, in which female students are significantly underrepresented, agreeing\nwith a gender stereotype was correlated negatively with the performance of\nfemale students on the conceptual physics surveys. The fact that female\nstudents who agreed with the gender stereotype performed worse than female\nstudents who disagreed with it at the end of the year-long calculus-based\nphysics course may partly be due to an increased stereotype threat that female\nstudents who agree with the stereotype may experience in this course.\n",

The experience\nnevertheless provides an opportunity to investigate the optimal design of\nremote labs, with similar learning goals as in-person labs.

We use surveys and interviews\nto make two comparisons: remote labs vs. in-person labs; the different types of\nremote labs. Examining these two questions we find that remote labs perform as\nwell as in-person labs and students learn the most from at home physics\nexperiments while also enjoying those the most.\n",

The motivation for working out this problem\nare two fold: (i) to train students in setting up Newton's equations of motion\nby identifying force components and equating to the corresponding mass times\naccelerations and (ii) to make the students familiar with the expressions for\nacceleration in the polar coordinates that we introduce at the beginning of the\ncourse. After guiding them through the solution which predicts an eventual\nradially outward motion for the bead (except for a very special initial\ncondition), a typical question that gets asked is the following: The math is\nall fine sir, but how does the bead that is initially at rest at some point on\nthe rod manage to move radially out if there are no radial forces?

An in-class test about a Stirling engine with a regenerator was taken\nby three classes, and the students were asked to perform one of the most basic\nactivities---calculate the efficiency of the heat engine. Our data suggest that\nquite a few students have not developed a robust conceptual understanding of\nbasic engineering knowledge of the heat engine, including the function of the\nregenerator and the influence of piston movements on the heat and work involved\nin the engine. Most notably, although the science error ratios of the three\nclasses were similar ($\\sim$10\\%), the engineering error ratios of the three\nclasses were high (above 50\\%), and the class that was given a simple tutorial\nof engineering knowledge of heat engine exhibited significantly smaller\nengineering error ratio by about 20\\% than the other two classes.

The Physics Measurement Questionnaire (PMQ), a research-based\nassessment of student understanding around statistical measurement uncertainty,\nwas used to measure the effectiveness of that transformation. Here, we analyze\nstudent responses to the PMQ at the beginning and end of the CU course. We also\ncompare such responses from two semesters: one before and one after the\ntransformation. We present evidence that students in both semesters shifted\ntheir reasoning in ways aligned with the measurement uncertainty learning goal.\nFurthermore, we show that more students in the transformed semester shifted in\nways aligned with the learning goal, and that those students tended to\ncommunicate their reasoning with greater sophistication than students in the\noriginal course. These findings provide evidence that even a traditional lab\ncourse can support valuable learning, and that transforming such a course to\nalign with well-defined learning goals can result in even more effective\nlearning experiences.\n",

In this work, we\nevaluate whether this claim is supported by physics graduate school admissions\ndecisions. We used admissions data from five PhD-granting physics departments\nover a 2-year period (N=2537) to see how the fraction of applicants admitted\nvaried based on their physics GRE scores. We compared applicants with low GPAs\nto applicants with higher GPAs, applicants from large undergraduate\nuniversities to applicants from smaller undergraduate universities, and\napplicants from selective undergraduate institutions to applicants from less\nselective undergraduate institutions. We also performed a mediation and\nmoderation analysis to provide statistical rigor and to better understand the\nprevious relationships. We find that for applicants who might otherwise have\nbeen missed (e.g. have a low GPA or attended a small or less selective school)\nhaving a high physics GRE score did not seem to increase the applicant's\nchances of being admitted to the schools. However, having a low physics GRE\nscore seemed to penalize otherwise competitive applicants. Thus, our work\nsuggests that the physics GRE does not, in fact, help applicants who might\notherwise be missed stand out.\n",

Fabrication-oriented activities were identified as\nconditional features of experimentation based on differences between projects,\nwhich interviewees attributed to variations in project resources. Interpersonal\nactivities were also viewed as conditional features of experimentation,\ndependent upon one's status as novice or expert.

To enhance engineering online\ninstruction during the pandemic era, we conducted an observational study at\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach (a minority-serving institution). 110\nfaculty and 627 students from six engineering departments participated in our\nsurveys and answered quantitative and qualitative questions to highlight the\nchallenges they experienced during the online instruction in Spring 2020.

Various\nphysics courses such as lectures, tutorials, and the laboratories had to be\ntransferred into online formats rapidly, resulting in a variety of\nsimultaneous, asynchronous, and mixed activities. To investigate how physics\nstudents perceived the sudden shift to online learning, we developed a\nquestionnaire and gathered data from N = 578 physics students from five\nuniversities in Germany, Austria, and Croatia. In this article, we report how\nthe problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how\nstudents' judge different formats of the courses and how useful and effective\nthey perceive them. The results are correlated to the students' self-efficacy\nratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated learning skills)\nand demographics. In a related article, we focus on the online physics lectures\nand compare simultaneous vs. asynchronous teaching and learning methods (n.n.).\nWe find that good communication abilities and self-organization skills are\npositively correlated for perceived learning achievement. Furthermore, the\nprevious duration of studies had a significant impact on the students'\nperceived overall learning achievement, on the students' acquisition of\nexperimental skills during the physics laboratories, and on their assessment of\nthe recitations' effectiveness. That is, students in their first academic year\nshow consistently lower scores than more progressed students. For the physics\nlaboratories, it was found that gathering real data was crucial to the\nacquisition of experimental skills and the reinforcement of content. For the\nphysics recitations, handing in own solutions for feedback was correlated with\nperceived effectiveness. We draw conclusions and implications for future online\nclasses.\n",

The data\nsuggest that the balls slip through part of their motion when rotating at an\nangular velocity different than the rolling angular velocity, so angular\nmomentum and frictional torque must be considered. Such experiments require no\nspecialized equipment other than a device to take a video, and the act of\ndigitizing the data provides the student with visual reinforcement of the\nphysics.

Although it may sound trivial, these questions are\namong the most challenging in the FCI. In this work involving 163 students, we\ninvestigate the correlation between student performance on the set of PFI\nquestions and the Cognitive Reflection Test. We find that for both scores in\nthe FCI as a whole and in the PFI questions, the range of values of the Pearson\ncoefficient at 95\\% confidence interval, is suggestive that cognitive\nreflection may be one of the contributing factors in the student performance in\nthe FCI. This is consistent with the idea that high level of cognitive\nreflection may help in eliminating seemingly valid choices (misconceptions) in\nthe FCI that are intuitive from everyday experience or \"common sense\" but\notherwise misleading. The ability to activate System 2 in Dual Process Theory,\nwhether from System 1 or right after reading a physics problem, may contribute\nin narrowing down the set of prospective valid answers in a given physics\nproblem. Complementary to cognitive reflection are other factors associated\nwith deep understanding of physics whose effects are expected to become more\nevident with the level of difficulty of a set of physics problems. Given two\nstudents with the same level of cognitive reflection, the one with deeper\nunderstanding of physics is more likely to get the correct answer. In our\nanalysis, the range of correlation coefficient for the set of PFI questions is\ndownshifted with respect to that for the FCI as a whole. This may be attributed\nto the more challenging nature of the latter compared to a significant fraction\nof the remaining questions in the former.\n",

If the phone is tossed in the air, then, neglecting air\nresistance, it is in free rotation (rotation in the absence of a torque) with\nrespect to its centre of mass, and the phone's gyroscope can be used to record\nthe rotational dynamics. This enables experimental investigation of free\nrotation. In this paper, we use a mobile phone to demonstrate the steady states\nfor rotation of the phone about two of its principal axes, and the instability\nin rotation about the third corresponding to the intermediate moment of\ninertia. We also show the approximate conservation of angular momentum and\nrotational kinetic energy during motion in the air, and compare the data with\nnumerical solution of Euler's equations for free rotation. Our results\ndemonstrate the capability of smartphones for investigating free rotation, and\nshould be of interest to college and university teachers developing \"at home\"\nphysics labs for remote learning.\n",

The first\nproblem is a pendulum composed of a rod and disk. The angular frequency of the\npendulum is calculated in two situations: disk fixed to the rod and disk free\nto spin. A detailed explanation of the change in the angular frequency from one\ncase to another is given. The second problem is a ladder which slides touching\na frictionless surface. We use this problem to highlight the fact that the\ncontact forces applied by the surface perform translational and rotational work\ndespite that the total mechanical energy of the ladder is conserved.\n",

There is currently a growing international interest in\nimplementing SRT in pre-university education as an introduction to modern\nphysics. For this reason, insights into learning opportunities and challenges\nin SRT education are needed. The field of research in SRT education is still at\nan early stage, especially at the level of secondary education, and there is a\nshortage of empirical evaluation of learning outcomes. In order to guide future\nresearch directions, there is a need for an overview and synthesis of the\nresults reported so far. We have selected 40 articles and categorized them\naccording to reported learning difficulties, teaching approaches, and research\ntools. Analysis shows that students at all educational levels experience\nlearning difficulties with the use of frames of reference, the postulates of\nSRT, and relativistic effects. In the reported teaching sequences,\ninstructional materials, and learning activities, these difficulties are\napproached from different angles. Some teaching approaches focus on thought\nexperiments to express conceptual features of SRT, while others use virtual\nenvironments to provide realistic visualization of relativistic effects. From\nthe reported teaching approaches, three learning objectives can be identified:\nto foster conceptual understanding, to foster understanding of the history and\nphilosophy of science, and to gain motivation and confidence toward SRT and\nphysics in general. In order to quantitatively compare learning outcomes of\ndifferent teaching strategies, a more thorough evaluation of assessment tools\nis required.\n",

        "summary": "  Kepler's 2nd law, the law of the areas, is usually taught in passing, between\nthe 1st and the 3rd laws, to be explained \"later on\" as a consequence of\nangular momentum conservation. The 1st and 3rd laws receive the bulk of\nattention; the 1st law because of the paradigm shift significance in\noverhauling the previous circular models with epicycles of both Ptolemy and\nCopernicus, the 3rd because of its convenience to the standard curriculum in\nhaving a simple mathematical statement that allows for quantitative homework\nassignments and exams. In this work I advance a method for teaching the 2nd law\nthat combines the paradigm-shift significance of the 1st and the mathematical\nproclivity of the 3rd. The approach is rooted in the historical method, indeed,\nplaced in its historical context, Kepler's 2nd is as revolutionary as the 1st:\nas the 1st law does away with the epicycle, the 2nd law does away with the\nequant. This way of teaching the 2nd law also formulates the \"time=area\"\nstatement quantitatively, in the way of Kepler's equation, M = E - e sin E\n(relating mean anomaly M, eccentric anomaly E, and eccentricity e), where the\nleft-hand side is time and the right-hand side is area. In doing so, it\nnaturally paves the way to finishing the module with an active learning\ncomputational exercise, for instance, to calculate the timing and location of\nMars' next opposition. This method is partially based on Kepler's original\nthought, and should thus best be applied to research-oriented students, such as\njunior and senior physics/astronomy undergraduates, or graduate students.\n",

Initiatives where students\nengage in independent research linked to cutting-edge physics within their\nschool over several months might help mitigate this, potentially facilitating\nthe uptake of science in higher education. However, how such initiatives are\nbest supported remains unclear and understudied. This paper evaluates a\nprovision framework, `Physics Research in School Environments' (PRiSE), using\nsurvey data from participating 14-18 year-old students and their teachers to\nunderstand their experience of the programme. The results show that PRiSE\nappears to provide much more positive experiences than typical university\noutreach initiatives due to the nature of the opportunities afforded over\nseveral months, which schools would not be able to provide without external\ninput. The intensive support offered is deemed necessary, with all elements\nappearing equally important. Based on additional feedback from independent\nresearchers and engagement professionals, we also suggest the framework could\nbe adopted at other institutions and applied to their own areas of scientific\nresearch, something which has already started to occur.\n",

After having completed\ntheir 6-month-long projects, the 14-18 year-old school students report having\nsubstantially increased in confidence relating to relevant scientific topics\nand methods as well as having developed numerous skills, outcomes which are\ncorroborated by teachers. There is evidence that the projects helped increase\nstudents' aspirations towards physics, whereas science aspirations (generally\nhigh to begin with) were typically maintained or confirmed through their\ninvolvement. Longitudinal evaluation 3 years later has revealed that these\nprojects have been lasting experiences for students which they have benefited\nand drawn upon in their subsequent university education. Data on students'\ndestinations suggests that their involvement in research projects has made them\nmore likely to undertake physics and STEM degrees than would otherwise be\nexpected. Cases of co-created novel physics research resulting from PRiSE also\nhas seemed to have a powerful effect, not only on the student co-authors but\nparticipating students from other schools also. Teachers have also been\npositively affected through participating, with the programme having influenced\ntheir own knowledge, skills, and pedagogy, as well as having advantageous\neffects felt across their wider schools.

We evaluate these concerns\napplied to one such programme, `Physics Research in School Environments'\n(PRiSE), which features projects in space science, astronomy, and particle\nphysics. Comparing the schools involved with PRiSE to those of other similar\nschemes and UK national statistics, we find that PRiSE has engaged a much more\ndiverse set of schools with significantly more disadvantaged groups than is\ntypical. While drop-off occurs within the protracted programme, we find no\nevidence of systematic biases present. The majority of schools that complete\nprojects return for multiple years of the programme, with this repeated buy-in\nfrom schools again being unpatterned by typical societal inequalities.\nTherefore, schools' ability to succeed at independent research projects appears\nindependent of background within the PRiSE framework. Qualitative feedback from\nteachers show that the diversity and equity of the programme, which they\nattribute to the level of support offered through PRiSE's framework, is valued\nand they have highlighted further ways of making the projects potentially even\nmore accessible.

A counterfactual mediation analysis\ndemonstrates that among admission metrics tested only UGPA is a significant\npredictor of overall PhD completion, and that UGPA predicts PhD completion\nindirectly through graduate grades. Thus UGPA measures traits linked to\ngraduate course grades, which in turn predict graduate completion.

        "summary": "  Introductory mechanics (\"physics 1\") is a critical gateway course for\nstudents desiring to pursue a STEM career. A major challenge with this course\nis that there is a large spread in the students' incoming physics preparation,\nand this level of preparation is strongly predictive of a students'\nperformance. The level of incoming preparation is also largely determined by a\nstudent's educational privilege, and so this course can amplify inequities in\nK-12 education and provide a barrier to a STEM career for students from\nmarginalized groups. Here, we present a novel introductory course design to\naddress such equity challenges in physics 1. We designed the course based on\nthe concept of deliberate practice to give students targeted, scaffolded, and\nrepeated opportunities to engage in research-identified practices and decisions\nrequired for effective problem-solving. We used real-world problems, as they\ncarry less resemblance to physics high school problems, and so even the\nstudents with the best high school physics instruction have little experience\nor skill in solving them. The students learned the physics content knowledge\nthey needed in future courses, particularly in engineering, and their\nproblem-solving skills improved substantially. Furthermore, the success in the\ncourse was not correlated with incoming physics preparation, in stark contrast\nto the outcomes from traditional physics 1 courses. These findings suggest that\nwe made physics 1 more equitable by employing a deliberate practice approach in\nthe context of real-world problem-solving.\n",

Even though there exists adequate\ndocumentation regarding programmatic postures and innovations, difficulties\npersist within the physics discipline. In this paper, we present innovative,\nprogrammatic implementations over an eight-year period at an undergraduate,\nliberal arts physics program. Some of these innovations accord with\nnationally-published, `best practices' for undergraduate physics programs,\nwhile others are novel to the program's context. Within this eight-year period,\nalterations are separated into curricular, co-curricular, and experiential\nelements. Innovations are introduced in some detail, and data are presented\nbefore, during, and after their introduction. While it is currently impossible\nto say which elements had the greatest impact, the synergistic combination did\nhave a positive effect on the program. Not only did the number of total majors\nand graduates increase, there was a 200% increase of women degree recipients\ncompared to the previous ten years, which boosted average graduation rates\nabove the national average (30% > 20%). Women were retained within the\nundergraduate physics major at a higher percentage during this time period when\ncompared to men in the program. Lastly, these women physics majors maintained\ncareers in science advancement fields at a rate of ~90% after $\\leq5$ years\npost-graduation. While this paper presents a singular case study, the purpose\nis two-fold: a) to validate quantitatively the work of national physics\norganizations within the context of a liberal arts institution, and b) to\nsuggest that a multi-level approach is most efficacious when considering\nprogrammatic innovations.\n",

The pedagogical design of the platform\nresulted in fewer event types and less variability in student trace data. The\ncurrent analysis scheme overcomes those challenges by conducting three levels\nof clustering analysis. On the event level, mixture-model fitting is employed\nto distinguish between abnormally short and normal assessment attempts and\nstudy events. On the module level, trace level clustering is performed with\nthree different methods for generating distance metrics between traces, with\nthe best performing output used in the next step. On the sequence level, trace\nlevel clustering is performed on top of module-level clusters to reveal\nstudents' change of learning strategy over time. We demonstrated that distance\nmetrics generated based on learning theory produced better clustering results\nthan pure data-driven or hybrid methods. The analysis showed that most students\nstarted the semester with productive learning strategies, but a significant\nfraction shifted to a multitude of less productive strategies in response to\nincreasing content difficulty and stress. The observations could prompt\ninstructors to rethink conventional course structure and implement\ninterventions to improve self-regulation at optimal times.\n",

However, despite the benefits computation has\ndelivered, we still lack a complete understanding of the computationally\nintegrated learning experience from the student perspective. In particular, we\nare interested in investigating how students develop expert-like perceptions of\ncomputation as a practice within the professional physics community. To\ninvestigate this aspect of student development, we employ the Communities of\nPractice framework, which describes how students navigate through a\nprofessional community by appropriating the community's practices and goals as\npersonally important. We introduce the construct of a COP-Model as a student's\ninternal representation of a professional community that they develop as they\nnavigate that community. We used this construct to formulate a set of research\nquestions and semistructured interview protocols to explore how five physics\nstudents represent the use of computation in their mental models of the global\nphysics community. We foreground these representations in the local academic\ncommunity established by their instructors in three concurrent computationally\nintegrated physics courses. We find that these students saw computation as a\nnormal and valuable part of physics practice, identified benefits of using\ncomputation in alignment with the physics community, struggle with confidence\nwith regards to computation, and demonstrate some expectations for\ncomputational proficiency that are misaligned with the physics community. We\nestablish these themes with interview excerpts and discuss implications for\ninstruction and future research.\n",

Yet, no studies have examined whether rubric-based admissions\nmethods represent a fundamental change of the admissions process or simply\nrepresent a new tool that achieves the same outcome. To address that, we\ndeveloped supervised machine learning models of graduate admissions data\ncollected from our department over a seven-year period. During the first four\nyears, our department used a traditional admissions process and switched to a\nrubric-based process for the following three years, allowing us to compare\nwhich parts of the applications were used to drive admissions decisions. We\nfind that faculty focused on applicants' physics GRE scores and grade point\naverages when making admissions decisions before the implementation of the\nrubric. While we were able to develop a sufficiently good model whose results\nwe could trust for the data before the implementation of the rubric, we were\nunable to do so for the data collected after the implementation of the rubric,\ndespite multiple modifications to the algorithms and data such as implementing\nTomek Links. Our inability to model the second data set despite being able to\nmodel the first combined with model comparison analyses suggests that\nrubric-based admissions does change the underlying process. These results\nsuggest that rubric-based holistic review is a method that could make the\ngraduate admissions process in physics more equitable.\n",

In this approach, students answer a related question individually\nafter a concept has been presented. Before they revote on the same question\nindividually, they are asked to convince others their answer is correct during\npeer discussion. The percentage of correct answer typically increased after\npeer discussion. However, Smith et al. highlighted that the improvement may be\ndue to copying, not because students actually learned how to reason correctly.\nTo exclude copying, Smith et al. modified Mazur's PI protocol by adding a\nsecond question Q2 after the students revote on the first question Q1. Q2 is\n'isomorphic' to Q1, meaning that it requires the application of the same\nconcept but the 'cover story' is different. The answer to Q1 is not revealed\nuntil after the individual vote on Q2. Here, we simplify Smith et al.'s PI\nprotocol by removing the revote on Q1. Moreover, our Q1 and Q2 are similar,\ni.e. the same but some information given is different.

An often\nimplicit, but crucial, goal is to develop students` attitudes, views, and\nexpectations about experimental physics to align with practicing experimental\nphysicists. The assessment of laboratory courses upon this one dimension of\nlearning has been intensively studied in US institutions using the Colorado\nLearning Attitudes Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). However,\nthere is no such an instrument available to use in Germany, and the influence\nof laboratory courses on students` views about the nature of experimental\nphysics is still unexplored at German-speaking institutions. Motivated by the\nlack of an assessment tool to investigate this goal in laboratory courses at\nGerman-speaking institutions, we present a translated version of the E-CLASS\nadapted to the context at German-speaking institutions. We call the German\nversion of the E-CLASS, the GE-CLASS. We describe the translation process and\nthe creation of an automated web-based system for instructors to assess their\nlaboratory courses. We also present first results using GE-CLASS obtained at\nthe University of Potsdam. A first comparison between E-CLASS and GE-CLASS\nresults shows clear differences between University of Potsdam and US students'\nviews and beliefs about experimental physics.\n",

He also\nfeels alienated because he views learning in terms of argument and intuition,\nnot algorithm and rote acceptance. Furthermore, for Michael the practice of\nsense-making defines him; it's an integral aspect of his identity [4]. Thus,\nMichael's self-reported sense of alienation resonates strongly with existing\nidentity-based accounts of students leaving the field [5],[6]. We contend the\nfield of engineering suffers if individuals like Michael don't pursue it.\nThrough this case study of Michael, we urge the retention discussion to\nconsider not just the demographic categories of people we hope to keep, but\nalso the approaches to knowledge, learning, and problem-solving we aim to\nsupport.\n",

First, dominant modes of science\nteacher professional development have been inadequate in helping teachers\ncreate learning environments that engage students in the practices of science,\nas called for most recently by the NGSS. Second, there is a lack of teacher\npresence and voice in the national dialogue on education reform and assessment.\nIn this study, teachers led and participated in a professional community\nfocusing on STEM education research. In this community, teachers became\nincreasingly responsible for designing and enacting learning experiences for\nthemselves and their colleagues. We investigated the characteristics of the\nscience teachers learning process. Findings suggest that teachers who\nparticipated in this model generated knowledge and practices about teaching and\nlearning while simultaneously developing identities and practices as education\nreform advocates and agents of educational change.\n",

To help students\nlearn to reason this way, we created a set of supplemental activities called\nPhysics Invention Tasks (PITs)*. PITs engage students in quantification, the\nprocess of mathematically generating quantities central to modeling in physics.\nPITs depict a scenario in which students need to engage in decision-making\nassociated with creating quantities in order to resolve a problem. Students\nmake decisions about the arithmetic construction, the magnitude and associated\nunit, and in some cases spatial direction of a new quantity. The design of PITs\nis informed by Inventing with Contrasting Cases, an instructional approach\nshown to foster generativity, i.e., creativity with mathematical structures. In\nthis paper, we describe the theoretical foundation of PITs, and their structure\nand implementation. We share preliminary observations of the impact of PITs in\none course, averaged over two years, as measured by the FCI and CLASS. We see\nan improvement in the FCI normalized gain corresponding to the introduction of\nPITS and we see CLASS pre- to post-test gains that may be the highest reported\nfrom a large enrollment calculus-based physics course. We discuss future\nresearch into the learning mechanisms and instructor influence associated with\nPITs.\n  *available at http://inventiontasks.physics.rutgers.edu\n",

The course was held at \\'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\\'eal\n(\\'EPM), a world renowned engineering school and a pillar in Canada's\nengineering community. The course was offered twice in the 2014-2015 academic\nyear and more than 30 students from the graduate and undergraduate programs\nparticipated. The course incorporated ten pedagogical strategies, including\nserious games, an observation book, individual and group projects, etc., that\nwere expected to facilitate the development of cognitive abilities related to\ncreativity such as encoding, and associative analytical thinking. The CEDA\n(Creative Engineering Design Assessment) test was used to measure the students'\ncreativity at the beginning and at the end of the course. Field notes were\ntaken after each of the 15 three-hour sessions to qualitatively document the\neducative intervention along the semester and students gave anonymous written\nfeedback after completing the last session. Quantitative and qualitative\nresults suggest that an increase in creativity is possible to obtain with a\ncourse designed to development cognitive abilities related to creativity. Also,\nstudents appreciated the course, found it relevant, and made important,\nmeaningful learnings regarding the creative process, its cognitive mechanism\nand the approaches available to increase it.\n",

The graduate and undergraduate teaching\nassistants (TAs) in the PR group recitations provided guidance and coaching to\nhelp students learn effective problem solving heuristics.

As one measure of the impact\nof this intervention, we investigated how likely students were to draw diagrams\nto help with problem solving. On the final exam with only multiple-choice\nquestions, the PR group drew diagrams on more problems than the traditional\ngroup, even when there was no external reward for doing so.

In order to help students solve\nquantitative problems involving strong alternative conceptions correctly,\nappropriate scaffolding support can be helpful. The goal of this study is to\nexamine how different scaffolding supports involving analogical problem solving\ninfluence introductory physics students' performance on a target quantitative\nproblem in a situation where many students' solution process is derailed due to\nalternative conceptions. Three different scaffolding supports were designed and\nimplemented in calculus-based and algebra-based introductory physics courses to\nevaluate the level of scaffolding needed to help students learn from an\nanalogical problem that is similar in the underlying principles but for which\nthe problem solving process is not derailed by alternative conceptions. We\nfound that for the quantitative problem involving strong alternative\nconceptions, simply guiding students to work through the solution of the\nanalogical problem first was not enough to help most students discern the\nsimilarity between the two problems. However, if additional scaffolding\nsupports that directly helped students examine and repair their knowledge\nelements involving alternative conceptions were provided, students were more\nlikely to discern the underlying similarities between the problems and avoid\ngetting derailed by alternative conceptions when solving the targeted problem.\nWe also found that some scaffolding supports were more effective in the\ncalculus-based course than in the algebra-based course. This finding emphasizes\nthe fact that appropriate scaffolding support must be determined via research\nin order to be effective.\n",

Three\nhundred and eighty two students from a calculus-based and an algebra-based\nintroductory physics course were asked to learn from a solved problem provided\nand take advantage of what they learned from it to solve another isomorphic\nproblem (which we call the quiz problem). The solved problem provided has two\nsub-problems while the quiz problem has three sub-problems, which is known to\nbe challenging for introductory students from previous research. In addition to\nthe solved problem, students also received extra scaffolding supports that were\nintended to help them discern and exploit the underlying similarities of the\nisomorphic solved and quiz problems. The results suggest that students had\ngreat difficulty in transferring what they learned from a 2-step problem to a\n3-step problem. Although most students were able to learn from the solved\nproblem to some extent with the scaffolding provided and invoke the relevant\nprinciples in the quiz problem, they were not necessarily able to apply the\nprinciples correctly. We also conducted think-aloud interviews with 6\nintroductory students in order to understand in-depth the difficulties they had\nand explore strategies to provide better scaffolding. The interviews suggest\nthat students often superficially mapped the principles employed in the solved\nproblem to the quiz problem without necessarily understanding the governing\nconditions underlying each principle and examining the applicability of the\nprinciple in the new situation in an in-depth manner. Findings suggest that\nmore scaffolding is needed to help students in transferring from a two-step\nproblem to a three step problem and applying the physics principles\nappropriately.\n",

TAs,\nhowever, do not notice and do not use many features described in the research\nliterature as supportive of this goal. A possible explanation for this gap\nbetween their belief and practices is that these features conflict with another\npowerful set of values concerned with keeping students engaged, setting\nadequate standards, as well as pragmatic considerations such as time\nrequirements and the assignment of grades.\n",

Using this context, students can learn about\nhow to prepare a specific quantum state starting from an arbitrary state,\nissues related to the time evolution of the wave function, and quantum\nmeasurement. It can also be exploited to teach students about the distinction\nbetween the physical space where one performs the experiment and the Hilbert\nspace where the state of the system lies and how the information about the\nstate of the system in the Hilbert space can be exploited to interpret the\npossible outcomes of the experiment in the physical space.

Here we analyze\nwritten responses to a pair of non-intuitive isomorphic problems given to\nintroductory physics students and discussions with a subset of students about\nthem. Students were asked to explain their reasoning for their written\nresponses. We call the paired problems isomorphic because they require the same\nphysics principle to solve them. However, the initial conditions are different\nand the frictional force is responsible for increasing the linear speed of an\nobject in one of the problems while it is responsible for decreasing the linear\nspeed in the other problem. We categorize student responses and evaluate\nstudent performance within the context of their evolving expertise. We compare\nand contrast the patterns of student categorization for the two isomorphic\nproblems. We discuss why certain incorrect responses were better than others\nand shed light on the evolution of students' expertise. We compare the\nperformance of students who worked on both isomorphic problems with those who\nworked only on one of the problems to understand whether students recognized\ntheir underlying similarity and whether isomorphic pairs gave students\nadditional insight in solving each problem.\n",

A non-intuitive introductory-level\nproblem was identified and posed to twenty physics professors. The problem\nplaced the professors in a situation often encountered by students, and their\nresponse highlights the importance of intuition and experience in problem\nsolving. While professors had difficulty in solving the problem under the time\nconstraint, they initially employed a systematic approach, e.g., visualizing\nthe problem, considering various conservation laws, and examining limiting\ncases. After finding that familiar techniques were not fruitful, they made\nincorrect predictions based on one of two equally important factors. By\ncontrast, other more familiar problems that require the consideration of two\nimportant principles (e.g., conservation of both energy and momentum for a\nballistic pendulum) are quickly solved by the same professors. The responses of\nstudents who were given the same problem reflected no overarching strategies or\nsystematic approaches, and a much wider variety of incorrect responses were\ngiven. This investigation highlights the importance of teaching effective\nproblem solving heuristics, and suggests that instructors assess the difficulty\nof a problem from the perspective of beginning students.\n",

One characteristic distinguishing more\nexperienced physicists from novice students is that they make better use of\nproblem solving as a learning opportunity. Experts were found to spend more\ntime than novices in monitoring their work, reflecting upon their possibly\ndeficient approach to solving a problem, reconsidering their choices as\nnecessary, and extending and refining their knowledge structure. Moreover,\nresearch on worked-out examples suggests that better performing students are\nthose who self-explain, that is, elaborate to themselves what they are learning\nfrom those examples, generate inferences, acknowledge mismatches between their\nown approach and that of the example, and attempt to resolve conflicts\n(self-repair).

We examine potential\nfactors that may help or hinder transfer of problem-solving skills from one\nproblem in a pair to the other. For some paired isomorphic problems, one\ncontext often turned out to be easier for students in that it was more often\ncorrectly solved than the other. When quantitative and conceptual questions\nwere paired and given back to back, students who answered both questions in the\nIPP often performed better on the conceptual questions than those who answered\nthe corresponding conceptual questions only. Although students often took\nadvantage of the quantitative counterpart to answer a conceptual question of an\nIPP correctly, when only given the conceptual question, students seldom tried\nto convert it into a quantitative question, solve it and then reason about the\nsolution conceptually. Misconceptions associated with friction in some problems\nwere so robust that pairing them with isomorphic problems not involving\nfriction did not help students discern their underlying similarities.\nAlternatively, from the knowledge in pieces perspective, the activation of the\nknowledge resource related to friction was so strongly and automatically\ntriggered by the context, which is outside the conscious control of the\nstudent, that students did not look for analogies with paired problems or other\naids that may be present.\n",

Here, we discuss the effectiveness\nof research-based e-learning tutorials as self-paced learning tools in large\nenrollment brick and mortar introductory physics courses. These interactive\ntutorials were developed via research in physics education and were found to be\neffective for a diverse group of introductory physics students in one-on-one\nimplementation. Instructors encouraged the use of these self-paced tools in a\nself-paced learning environment by telling students that they would be helpful\nfor solving the assigned homework problems and that the underlying physics\nprinciples in the tutorial problems would be similar to those in the in-class\nquizzes (which we call paired problems). We find that many students, who\nstruggled in the courses in which these adaptive e-learning tutorials were\nassigned as a self-study tool, performed poorly on the paired problems. In\ncontrast, a majority of student volunteers in one-on-one implementation greatly\nbenefited from the tutorials and performed well on the paired problems. This\nsuggests that many students enrolled in introductory physics courses did not\neffectively engage with the self-paced tutorials outside of class and may have\nonly used them superficially. The findings suggest that many students in need\nof out-of-class remediation via self-paced learning tools may have difficulty\nmotivating themselves and may lack the self-regulation and time-management\nskills to engage effectively with tools specially designed to help them learn\nat their own pace.

Initial evidence suggests that\nworkshop leaders often overlook central tenets of education research that are\nwell-established in classroom contexts, such as the role of interactivity in\nenabling student learning. As such, there is a need to develop more robust,\nevidence-based models of how best to support faculty learning in professional\ndevelopment contexts, and to activity support workshop leaders in relating\ntheir design decisions to familiar ideas form other educational contexts.

We also find evidence of co-construction of knowledge in that\nstudents who did not answer the clicker questions individually were able to\nanswer them correctly after discussion with peers. Finally, we discuss the\ntrends in the percentage of students present in class who responded to the\nclicker questions in the allotted time as the semester progressed.\n",

A conceptual\napproach to quantum mechanics is being implemented in more and more\nintroductory physics courses around the world. Because of the differences\nbetween the conceptual nature of quantum mechanics and classical physics,\nresearch on misconceptions, testing, and teaching strategies for introductory\nquantum mechanics is needed. For this review, 74 articles were selected and\nanalyzed for the misconceptions, research tools, teaching strategies and\nmultimedia applications investigated. Outcomes were categorized according to\ntheir contribution to the various subtopics of quantum mechanics. Analysis\nshows that students have difficulty relating quantum physics to physical\nreality. It also shows that the teaching of complex quantum behavior, such as\ntime dependence, superposition and the measurement problem, has barely been\ninvestigated for the secondary and lower undergraduate level. At the secondary\nschool level, this review shows a need to investigate student difficulties\nconcerning wave functions and potential wells. Investigation of research tools\nshows the necessity for the development of assessment tools for secondary and\nlower undergraduate education, which cover all major topics and are suitable\nfor statistical analysis. Furthermore, this review shows the existence of very\ndiverse ideas concerning teaching strategies for quantum mechanics and a lack\nof research into which strategies promote understanding. This review underlines\nthe need for more empirical research into student difficulties, teaching\nstrategies, activities and research tools intended for a conceptual approach\nfor quantum mechanics.\n",

We\nhave been studying difficulties in understanding magnetism encountered by\nstudents in the calculus-based introductory physics courses. A majority of\nthese students are engineering majors. Student difficulties were assessed by\nadministering written free-response questions and by developing and\nadministering a research-based multiple-choice test to students. We also\nconducted individual interviews with a subset of students. Some of these\ninterviews were lecture-demonstration based interviews in which students were\nasked to predict the outcomes of experiments, perform the experiments and\nreconcile the differences between their predictions and observations. Some of\nthe common misconceptions found in magnetism are analogous to those found in\nelectrostatics. Some additional difficulties are due to the non-intuitive three\ndimensional nature of the relation between magnetic field, magnetic force and\nvelocity of the charged particles or direction of current. Another finding is\nthat students often used their gut feeling and had more difficulty reconciling\nwith the idea that the magnetic force and field are perpendicular to each other\nwhen they were shown actual lecture-demonstration setups and asked to predict\noutcomes of experiments than when they were asked to explain relation between\nmagnetic force and field theoretically solely based upon an equation. We\ndiscuss the implications of this research to teaching and learning.\n",

In\nother work, metacognition has been identified as an important feature of\ntroubleshooting. However, that work has focused primarily on individual\nstudents' metacognitive processes or troubleshooting abilities. In contrast,\nelectronics courses often require students to work in pairs, and hence\nstudents' in-class experiences likely have significant social dimensions that\nare not well understood. In this work, we use an existing framework for\nsocially mediated metacognition to analyze audiovisual data from think-aloud\nactivities in which eight pairs of students from two institutions attempted to\ndiagnose and repair a malfunctioning electric circuit. In doing so, we provide\ninsight into some of the social metacognitive dynamics that arise during\ncollaborative troubleshooting. We find that students engaged in socially\nmediated metacognition at multiple key transitions during the troubleshooting\nprocess. Reciprocated metacognitive dialogue arose when students were\ncollectively strategizing about which measurements to perform, or reaching a\nshared understanding of the circuit's behavior. In addition to elaborating upon\nthese findings, we discuss implications for instruction, and we identify areas\nfor potential future investigation.\n",

In the present work, we report on the\nexperiences and practices of two instructors who used the GRF in an\nintroductory physics lab course. Our analysis draws on two sources of data: (i)\npost-semester interviews with both instructors and (ii) the instructors'\nwritten responses to 134 student reflections. Interviews focused on the\ninstructors' perceptions about the goals and framing of the GRF activity, and\ncharacteristics of good or bad feedback. Their GRF responses were analyzed for\nthe presence of up to six types of statement: encouraging statements,\nnormalizing statements, empathizing statements, strategy suggestions, resource\nsuggestions, and feedback to the student on the structure of their reflection.\nWe find that both instructors used all six response types, in alignment with\ntheir perceptions of what counts as good feedback.

        "summary": "  Education is increasingly being framed by a competence mindset; the value of\nknowledge lies much more in competence performativity and innovation than in\nsimply knowing. Reaching such competency in areas such as astronomy and physics\nhas long been known to be challenging. The movement from everyday conceptions\nof the world around us to a disciplinary interpretation is fraught with\npitfalls and problems. Thus, what underpins the characteristics of the\ndisciplinary trajectory to competence becomes an important educational\nconsideration. In this article we report on a study involving what students and\nlecturers discern from the same disciplinary semiotic resource. We use this to\npropose an Anatomy of Disciplinary Discernment (ADD), a hierarchy of what is\nfocused on and how it is interpreted in an appropriate, disciplinary manner, as\nan overarching fundamental aspect of disciplinary learning. Students and\nlecturers in astronomy and physics were asked to describe what they could\ndiscern from a video simulation of travel through our Galaxy and beyond. 137\npeople from nine countries participated. The descriptions were analysed using a\nhermeneutic interpretive study approach. The analysis resulted in the\nformulation of five qualitatively different categories of discernment; the ADD,\nreflecting a view of participants' competence levels. The ADD reveals four\nincreasing levels of disciplinary discernment: Identification, Explanation,\nAppreciation, and Evaluation. This facilitates the identification of a clear\nrelationship between educational level and the level of disciplinary\ndiscernment. The analytical outcomes of the study suggest how teachers of\nscience, after using the ADD to assess the students disciplinary knowledge, may\nattain new insights into how to create more effective learning environments by\nexplicitly crafting their teaching to support the crossing of boundaries in the\nADD model.\n",

This is particularly\nimportant in fields that accept newcomers with diverse scholastic backgrounds,\ne.g. Systems Biology. With traditional interdisciplinary instruction, the\ninstructor must cover pre-requisite information from multiple disciplines to\nensure all students begin at a common baseline - slowing the learning process.\nWith ALICE, students follow a personalized syllabus based on their previous\nknowledge and work towards individual goals. Implementing an adaptive learning\nsystem in an interdisciplinary course requires careful considerations of the\ninstructional design. Structuring material, formulating assessments, and other\ninstructional design aspects must be carefully considered. These considerations\nare detailed through the exploration of a case study implementing ALICE in a\ngraduate level Systems Biology course.\n",

In many cases, physics topics appear multiple times in different\ncontexts across the undergraduate physics curriculum. As these common topics\nreappear, student difficulties can perpetuate from one context to the next, or\nnew difficulties can emerge as students encounter new physical contexts. One\nexample of such a topic is boundary conditions. It is broadly considered to be\nan important topic that advanced physics undergraduates are expected to\nunderstand and apply in multiple topical areas including classical mechanics,\nquantum mechanics, and throughout electricity and magnetism (EM). We report\nfindings from an investigation of student difficulties using boundary\nconditions focusing on the context of electrodynamics. Our data sources include\nstudent responses to traditional exam questions, conceptual survey questions,\nand think aloud interviews. The analysis was guided by an analytical framework\nthat characterizes how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on\nboundary conditions. Common observed student difficulties include: activating\nboundary conditions in appropriate contexts; constructing a complex expression\nfor the E&M waves; mathematically simplifying and manipulating complex\nexponential and, checking if the reflection and transmission coefficient are\nphysical. We also present potential pedagogical implications based on our\nobservations.\n",

This study aimed to\nidentify barriers to students' self-directed engagement with two anatomy\neducational games, methods to overcome identified barriers, and the impact of\nengagement on learning performance. Employing the within-case and cross-case\napproach and triangulation of data, four educational-game specific barriers\nemerged (from most common to least common): 1) negative perceptions of\neducational games, 2) incompatible audience, 3) incompatible difficulty, and 4)\nprice. Path analysis found that engagement may have insignificant, positive\neffects on performance. These findings indicate that students' self-directed\nengagement with educational games is impeded by unique barriers and engagement\nmay not be vital for performance.

We can treat matter as a\ncontinuum and solve differential equations or we can treat it discretely and\nsolve massive N-body problems. The differential equations produced by\nmeaningful problems can be extremely difficult to formulate and much more\ndifficult to solve, if not impossible. Hence, in most cases, the resultant\ndifferential equation is discretized and approximated numerically. We know that\nmatter is discrete, so why all the circular work of taking a discrete\nphenomenon, putting a continuous model on it, and then discretizing this\ncontinuous model into something that is solvable? We do this because the sheer\nnumber of particles that make up any meaningful amount of matter is daunting\nand impossible to handle even with todays largest supercomputer. One discrete\napproach to deal with this problem is to group large numbers of particles\ntogether and treat them as individual units called quasimolecules. Then pray\nthat the bulk behavior of this model behaves in a similar manner to the matter\nbeing studied. The mathematical skills needed to set up such problems are much\nmore attainable than those needed to set up the differential equation, but the\nN-body problem that ensues usually requires a supercomputer to propagate it\nthrough time. Until recently the cost of such machines made this approach out\nof the financial reach of all except the privileged few. But, thanks to the\ngaming industry and recent advances in the ease to which one can program modern\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), this is no longer true. Supercomputing has\nfinally reached the masses. Here we use a simple example of a vibrating string\nto compare the continuous and discrete approaches to modeling and show how GPUs\ncan enhance an undergraduate modeling experience.\n",

Most\nfrequently, students work on `capacitor-like' geometries with current flowing\nbetween two opposite electrodes. A `topographical' investigation across the\nembedding medium (map of equipotential curves) allows to reassure a number of\nphysical properties.\n  This paper focuses on some less common configurations that bear pedagogical\ninterest. We analyze `open-geometries' with electrodes in the form of long\nstrips with slits. They provide a natural groundwork to bring the student to\ncomplex variable methods. Aided by this, we show that shaping the conducting\npaper board one may analyze finite size effects, as well as some meaningful\ndiscontinuities in the measured potential.\n  The concept of conjugate electric potentials is exploited. Equipotentials and\nelectric field lines acquire interchangeable roles and may be obtained in\ncomplementary `dual' experiments. A feasible theoretical analysis based on\nintroductory complex variables and standardized numerics gives a remarkable\nquantification of the experimental results.\n",

The apparatus consists of a pair of identical resonant coils that\ncan be moved relative to one another. A signal generator circuit is inductively\ncoupled to the transmitting coil using a single loop of wire. Likewise, a\nsingle loop of wire couples the receiving coil to a load impedance. A matching\ncircuit was used to tune the impedance of the system of coupled resonators to\nmatch the 50-$\\ohm$ output impedance of the signal generator. A low-cost vector\nnetwork analyzer was used to characterize the system performance as the\ndistance between the pair of coils was changed. When the distance between the\ntransmitting and receiving coils was small, a double resonance emerged. The\nfrequency difference between the pair resonances was inversely proportional to\nthe distance between the coils. After the system was fully characterized, it\nwas operated with up to 20 W of incident power. Our measurements revealed that,\nat weak coupling, the fraction of the incident power lost to radiation\nincreases linearly with the distance between the coils. Finally, we were able\nto transmit enough power to dimly light a 60-W incandescent light bulb.\n",

However, in general, these techniques\nare usually used independently. Here, we focus on a less-explored feature: the\npossibility of using supplementary video analysis and smartphone (or other\nmobile devices) sensors. First, we review some experiments reported in the\nliterature using both tools. Next, we present an experiment specially suited to\ncompare both resources and discuss in detail some typical results. We found\nthat, as a rule, video analysis provides distances or angular variables, while\nsensors supplies velocity or acceleration (either linear or angular). The\nnumerical differentiation of higher derivatives, i.e. acceleration, usually\nimplies noisier results while the opposite process (the numerical integration\nof a temporal evolution) gives rise to the accumulation of errors. In a\nclassroom situation, the comparison between these two techniques offers an\nopportunity to discuss not only concepts related to the specific experiment but\nalso with the experimental and numerical aspects including their pros and cons.\n",

Physics\ncourses often have high failure rates that may disproportionately harm students\nwho are marginalized by racism, sexism, and classism. We examined the\nassociations between Learning Assistant (LA) supported courses and equity in\nnon-passing grades (i.e., d, drop, fail, or withdrawal; DFW) in introductory\nphysics courses. The data used in the study came from 2312 students in 41\nsections of introductory physics courses at a regional Hispanic serving\ninstitution. We developed hierarchical generalized linear models of student DFW\nrates that accounted for gender, race, first-generation status and LA-supported\ninstruction. We used a quantitative critical race theory (QuantCrit)\nperspective focused on the role of hegemonic power structures in perpetuating\ninequitable student outcomes. Our QuantCrit perspective informed our research\nquestions, methods, and interpretations of findings. The models associated LAs\nwith overall decreases in DFW rates and larger decreases in DFW rates for\nstudents of color than their white peers. While the inequities in DFW rates\nwere lower in LA-supported courses, they were still present.\n",

Recently, some RBAs have been moved to online platforms\nto address these limitations.

We gave\ntwo upper-division RBAs to courses at five institutions; the RBAs were hosted\nonline and featured embedded JavaScript code which collected information on\nstudents' behaviors (e.g., copying text, printing). With these data, we examine\nthe prevalence of these behaviors, and their correlation with students' scores,\nto determine if online and paper-based RBAs are comparable.

Students suffer from difficulties in\nderiving, justifying, or interpreting the identities, misconceptions about\npartial derivatives, and a lack of in-depth understanding of the meanings of\nidentities. We propose a novel diagrammatic method for the calculus of\ndifferentials and partial derivatives called the \"sunray diagram\" that resolves\nthe difficulties above. The sunray diagram technique relates a partial\nderivative with \"arrow sliding,\" which enables an aesthetic and intuitive\nmanipulation of partial derivative expressions in the form of successive arrow\nslidings. Furthermore, the sunray diagram is more than an ad hoc or abstract\nmachinery but is based on the symplectic structure of thermodynamics; the\nsunray diagram admits a direct physical interpretation on the P-V (or T-S)\nplane. We elaborate on such physical semantics of the sunray diagram by taking\nMaxwell's approach to the geometry of thermodynamic structures--reinterpreted\nin terms of differential geometry--as a reference point. We anticipate that our\ndiscussion introduces the geometry of thermodynamics to learners and enriches\nthe graphical pedagogy in physics education.\n",

We use 10 years of institutional data at a large public university\nto investigate trends in the majors that men and women declare, drop after\ndeclaring, and earn degrees in as well as the GPA of the students who drop or\nearn a degree. We find that the majors with the lowest number of students also\nhave the highest rates of attrition. Moreover, we find alarming GPA trends,\ne.g., women who drop majors on average earn higher grades than men who drop\nthose majors, and in some STEM majors, women who drop the majors were earning\ncomparable grades to men who persist in those majors. These quantitative\nfindings call for a better understanding of the reasons students drop a major\nand for making learning environments equitable and inclusive.\n",

In the research discussed here, the performance of students in\nEBAE courses at a particular level is compared with LB courses in two\nsituations: (i) the same instructor taught two courses, one of which was a\nflipped course involving EBAE methods and the other an LB course, while the\nhomework, recitations, and final exams were kept the same; (ii) student\nperforamnce in all of the EBAE courses taught by different instructors was\naveraged and compared with LB courses of the same type also averaged over\ndifferent instructors.

Such tools can be especially helpful for students who lack\nadequate prior preparation. However, one critical issue is ensuring that\nstudents, especially those in need of additional help, engage with the tools as\nintended. Here we first discuss an empirical investigation in which students in\na large algebra-based physics course were given opportunities to work through\nresearch-validated tutorials outside of class as self-study tools. Students\nwere provided these optional tutorials after traditional instruction in\nrelevant topics and were then given quizzes that included problems that were\nidentical to the tutorial problems with regard to the physics principles\ninvolved but had different contexts. We find that students who worked through\nthe tutorials as self-study tools struggled to transfer their learning to solve\nproblems that used the same physics principles. On the other hand, students who\nworked on the tutorials in supervised, one-on-one situations performed\nsignificantly better than them. These empirical findings suggest that many\nintroductory physics students may not engage effectively with self-paced\nlearning tools unless they are provided additional incentives and support,\ne.g., to aid with self-regulation. Inspired by the empirical findings, we\npropose a holistic theoretical framework to help create learning environments\nin which students with diverse backgrounds are provided support to engage\neffectively with self-study tools.\n",

One key framework\nfor analyzing student thinking has found that student thinking is more\npoint-like, putting emphasis on the results of a single experimental trial,\nwhereas set-like thinking relies on the results of many trials. Recent work,\nhowever, has found that students rarely fall into one of these two extremes,\nwhich may be a limitation of how student thinking is evaluated. Measurements of\nstudent thinking have focused on probing students' procedural knowledge by\nasking them, for example, what steps they might take next in an experiment. Two\ncommon refrains are to collect more data, or to improve the experiment and\ncollect better data. In both of these cases, the underlying reasons behind\nstudent responses could be based in point-like or set-like thinking. In this\nstudy we use individual student interviews to investigate how advanced physics\nstudents believe the collection of more and better data will affect the results\nof a classical and a quantum mechanical experiment.

These learning theories place the learner as the sole\nconstructor of knowledge and emphasize the importance of the learner's inquiry\nprocess (Yilmaz, 2008). In constructivist inquiry-based science education, lab\nexperiences frequently play an important role in instruction as they provide\nstudents with opportunities to observe and make sense of the world around them\n(National Research Council, 2000), which raises the question of how\ninquiry-based science instruction can be translated to online environments.\nThere are several models for lab experiences in online science courses,\nincluding hands-on labs where students directly manipulate materials, remote\nlabs where students manipulate materials through a computer, and virtual labs\nand simulations where students work with simulated materials (Powell, et al.,\n2010). Hands-on labs play an important role, especially given constructivist\nviews that students construct meaning by making observations of the world\naround them, but there is evidence that simulated and virtual labs can play an\nimportant role and may even be better suited to some instructional goals than\nhands-on labs. Constructivist instruction also requires students to make their\nprocess visible and teachers to be responsive to student thinking, both of\nwhich are more challenging in online environments (Crippen, et al., 2013).\nHowever, with intentional design, these features can be incorporated into\nonline science courses (Jaber, et al., 2018; Jang, 2009).\n",

In this preliminary study, we explored the activities male\nand female students take on during a lab session at a university in Denmark.\nDifferent from many studies, the class was majority-female, so three of the\nseven groups were all female and the rest were mixed-gender. We found that\nstudents in mixed-gender groups divide tasks in similar ways to mixed-gender\ngroups at North American institutions, with men handling the equipment and\nwomen handling the computer more often. We also found that women in\nsingle-gender groups took on each of the available roles with approximately\nequal frequency, but women in single-gender groups spent more time on the\nequipment than students in mixed-gender groups. We interpret the results\nthrough poststructual gender theory and the notion of `doing physics' and\n`doing gender' in physics labs.\n",

The\ncurrent paper introduces a new data analysis scheme that could improve the\naccuracy of the measurement by accounting for possible differences in students'\ngoal orientation and behavior, as well as revealing the possible mechanism by\nwhich one of the two interventions improves transfer ability. Based on a two by\ntwo framework of self-regulated learning, students with a performance-avoidance\noriented goal are more likely to guess on some of the assessment attempts in\norder to save time, resulting in an underestimation of the student populations'\ntransfer ability. The current analysis shows that about half of the students\nhad frequent brief initial assessment attempts, and significantly lower correct\nrates on certain modules, which we think is likely to have originated at least\nin part from students adopting a performance-avoidance strategy. We then\ndivided the remaining population, for which we can be certain that few students\nadopted a performance-avoidance strategy, based on whether they interacted with\none of the intervention modules designed to develop basic problem solving\nskills, or passed that module on their first attempt without interacting with\nthe instructional material. By comparing to propensity score matched\npopulations from a previous semester, we found that the improvement in\nsubsequent transfer performance observed in a previous study mainly came from\nthe latter population, suggesting that the intervention served as an effective\nreminder for students to activate existing skills, but fell short of developing\nthose skills among those who have yet to master it.\n",

While many countries\nhave opted for suspension of lessons, this cannot continue indefinitely and\nalternative means to continue lessons must be developed. While online and\nblended learning (including MOOCs) have been an active subject of research and\ndiscourse during the pre-pandemic days, onset of the pandemic has suddenly\ncreated an immediacy to such means of course delivery, better than any\nadministrator or teaching committee could have done. This creates both a gap\nand tension in terms of successful and engaging content delivery, where\ntraditional modes of synchronous content delivery is now forced to be brought\nonline. Yet, the situation provides educators with an opportunity to explore\nthe merits and weaknesses of online learning. Thus, this article seeks to\noutline the challenges and paradigm shifts involved in such synchronous online\nlearning as a replacement for traditional classroom learning, following our\nexperience at SUTD of conducting a full 13-week online physics course between\nMay to August 2020. At the same time, we reflect on the merits brought about by\nthe availability of such technologies that can potentially be translated to the\nphysical physics classrooms.\n",

To assist them in developing\nor modifying activities for their situation, we examine research-based\nactivities to determine their goals and the features of the activities\nassociated with these goals. Since most activities ask students to perform\ntasks to assist them in learning, sixty-six activities from eleven different\nresearch-based curricula were coded for student actions. The coding scheme\ncontaining forty-nine codes in ten categories was developed from a subset of\nactivities, interviews with some of the activity designers, and recommendations\nfrom the American Association of Physics Teachers 2014 lab report. The results\nwere examined using k-means cluster analysis revealing three design clusters.\nWe label these clusters Thinking like a Scientists, Learning Concepts, Building\nModels.

In the Thinking like\na Scientist cluster, activities emphasize design of experiments by students,\ndiscussion, error analysis, reasonableness checking, supporting claims, and\nmaking assumptions or simplifications. The Learning Concepts cluster focuses on\nprediction of results and experimental observations. The Building Models\ncluster emphasizes discussion and answering physics or math questions that do\nnot use collected data.

Errors are routinely classified as statistical or\nsystematic. Although statistical errors are usually dealt with in the first\nyears of science studies, the typical approaches are based on manually\nperforming repetitive observations. Our work proposes a set of laboratory\nexperiments to teach error and uncertainties based on data recorded with the\nsensors available in many mobile devices. The main aspects addressed are the\nphysical meaning of the mean value and standard deviation, and the\ninterpretation of histograms and distributions. The normality of the\nfluctuations is analyzed qualitatively comparing histograms with normal curves\nand quantitatively comparing the number of observations in intervals to the\nnumber expected according to a normal distribution and also performing a\nChi-squared test. We show that the distribution usually follows a normal\ndistribution, however, when the sensor is placed on top of a loudspeaker\nplaying a pure tone significant differences with a normal distribution are\nobserved. As applications to every day situations we discuss the intensity of\nthe fluctuations in different situations, such as placing the device on a table\nor holding it with the hands in different ways. Other activities are focused on\nthe smoothness of a road quantified in terms of the fluctuations registered by\nthe accelerometer. The present proposal contributes to gaining a deep insight\ninto modern technologies and statistical errors and, finally, motivating and\nencouraging engineering and science students.\n",

Little\nresearch has been done regarding how students develop the algebraic concepts\nand skills involved in reasoning productively about physics quantities, which\nis different from either understanding of physics concepts or problem-solving\nabilities. We introduce the Physics Inventory of Quantitative Literacy (PIQL)\nas a tool for measuring quantitative literacy, a foundation of mathematical\nreasoning, in the context of introductory physics. We present the development\nof the PIQL and evidence of its validity for use in calculus-based introductory\nphysics courses. Unlike concept inventories, the PIQL is a reasoning inventory,\nand can be used to assess reasoning over the span of students' instruction in\nintroductory physics. Although mathematical reasoning associated with the PIQL\nis taught in prior mathematics courses, pre/post test scores reveal that this\nreasoning isn't readily used by most students in physics, nor does it develop\nas part of physics instruction--even in courses that use high-quality,\nresearch-based curricular materials.

In\nthis context, General Relativity (GR) occupies a prominent place, since it is\nrelated to astonishing scientific results, such as the first image of a black\nhole or the discovery of gravitational waves. In this paper we describe an\neducational proposal aimed at teaching GR in high school in a fun and playful\nway using the so-called rubber sheet analogy. We present a set of instructions\nto build a simple and low-cost space-time simulator, and a series of related\neducational cards that guide the teacher in the implementation of the\nactivities step by step. This work is the result of a long and productive\ndebate among Italian high school teachers who collaborate since many years with\nthe Department of Mathematics and Physics of Roma Tre University in Rome. As\nour proposal relies on the collaboration with the final users, we believe that\nit will meet their needs and expectations, and it will help to treat GR in high\nschool more and more over time.\n",

However, many Engineering\nThermodynamics textbooks focus only on evaluating the thermal efficiency of gas\npower cycle, while the important concept of specific cycle work is ignored.\nBased on the generalized temperature-entropy diagram for the gas power cycles\nproposed by the authors, an ideal Otto cycle and an ideal Miller-Diesel cycle\nare taking as examples for the thermodynamic analyses of gas power cycles.

Physics education\nresearch recommends grading practices that encourage students to provide\nevidence of understanding via explication of the problem-solving process.\nHowever, TAs may not necessarily grade in a manner that encourages students to\nprovide evidence of understanding in their solutions. Within the context of a\nsemester-long TA professional development course, we investigated whether\nencouraging TAs to use a grading rubric that appropriately weights the\nproblem-solving process and having them reflect upon the benefits of using such\na rubric prompts TAs to require evidence of understanding in student solutions.\nWe examined how the TAs graded realistic student solutions to introductory\nphysics problems before they were provided a rubric, whether TAs used the\nrubric as intended, whether they were consistent in grading similar solutions,\nand how TAs' grading criteria changed after discussing the benefits of a\nwell-designed rubric. We find that many TAs typically applied the rubric\nconsistently when grading similar student solutions but did not require\nstudents to provide evidence of understanding. TAs' written responses, class\ndiscussions, and individual interviews suggest that the instructional\nactivities involving the grading rubrics in this study were not sufficient to\nchange their grading practices.

In\nparticular, many hypotheses have been put forth for the reasons for the\nunder-representation and under-performance of women in physics. Here, we\npresent a framework for helping all students learn in science courses that\ntakes into account four factors: 1) characteristics of instruction and learning\ntools, 2) implementation of instruction and learning tools, 3) student\ncharacteristics, and 4) students' environments. While there has been much\nresearch on factor 1 (characteristics of instruction and learning tools), there\nhas been less focus on factor 2 (students' characteristics, and in particular,\nmotivational factors). Here, we focus on the baseline motivational\ncharacteristics of introductory physics students obtained from survey data to\ninform factor 2 of the framework. A longitudinal analysis of students'\nmotivational characteristics in two-semester introductory physics courses was\nperformed by administering pre- and post-surveys that evaluated students'\nself-efficacy, grit, fascination with physics, value associated with physics,\nintelligence mindset, and physics epistemology. Female students reported lower\nself-efficacy, fascination and value, and had a more \"fixed\" view of\nintelligence in the context of physics compared to male students. Grit was the\nonly factor on which female students reported averages that were equal to or\nhigher than male students throughout introductory physics courses. These gender\ndifferences can at least partly be attributed to the societal stereotypes and\nbiases about who belongs in physics and can excel in it.

In\nparticular, understanding when students do not engage productively with\nunexpected data may provide insights into how to better support students in\nmore open-ended labs. We examine video and audio data from groups within a lab\nsession where students were expected to find data inconsistent with the\npredictions of two models. In prior work, we examined the actions of the four\ngroups that productively grapple with this designed problem. Here, we analyze\nthe engagement of the three groups that do not. We conducted three phases of\nanalysis: 1) documenting large scale behaviors and time spent in on-topic\ndiscussion, 2) analyzing interactions with the teaching assistant, and 3)\nidentifying students' framing--their expectations for what is taking\nplace--when they were discussing their data. Our Phase 1 and 2 analysis show\nonly minor differences between the groups that engaged with the problem and\nthose that did not. Our Phase 3 analysis demonstrated that the groups that did\nnot engage with the problem framed the lab activity as about confirming a known\nresult or as a series of hoops to jump through to fulfill assignment\nrequirements. Implications for instruction include supporting teaching\nassistants to attend to students' framing and agency within laboratory\nclassrooms.\n",

In the current\neducational system, it is unlikely for a student to become a physicist if they\ndo not share the same attitudes about what it means to learn and do physics as\nthose held by most professional physicists. Evidence shows college physics\ncourses and degree programs do not support students in developing these\nattitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter\ncollege physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of\nattitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting\nrelationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes\nabout learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The\nanalyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students attitudes as\nmeasured by the Colorado learning attitudes about science survey. The data came\nfrom the LASSO database and included 2170 students in 46 calculus-based\nmechanics courses and 2503 students in 49 algebra-based mechanics courses\ntaught at 18 institutions. Like prior studies, we found that attitudes either\ndid not change or slightly decreased for most groups. Results identified large\ndifferences across intersecting race and gender groups representing educational\ndebts society owes these students. White students, particularly White men in\ncalculus-based courses, tended to have more expert-like attitudes than any\nother group of students. Instruction that addresses society's educational debts\ncan help move physics toward an inclusive culture supportive of diverse\nstudents and professionals.\n",

The data enabled the identification of relevant context\nelements; and the impact of these elements on physics faculty was explored by\nadapting a framework that examines instructors' professional development. The\nanalysis shows that both case study subjects used their physics expertise and\ngrowing understanding of their context to develop their physics teaching.\nHowever, this growth was enacted differently given the nature of their context,\nhighlighting instructors' strengths in navigating their local context to\nimprove their physics teaching.

In this paper, we discuss differences in performance on MCMR items\nthat result from differences in administration method (paper vs. online). In\nparticular, we find a tendency for ``clickiness'' in online administration:\nstudents choose more responses to MCMR items when taking the electronic version\nof the assessment. Based on these findings, we recommend that online\nadministration be compared only to other online administrations and not to\npaper administrations when comparing student results on MCMR items. These\nresults also suggest that MCMR items provide a unique opportunity to probe\ndifferences in online and on-paper administration of low-stakes assessments.\n",

An interesting phenomenon that has often been\nconsidered too difficult to be included in standard physics studies at bachelor\nand master level, can now be introduced even for second year bachelor students\nand up. In the original Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect the angular size of the\nsource (the star Sirius) was calculated by determining the distance between two\ndetectors that lead to a drop in the cross-correlations in the signals from the\ndetectors. We find that this principle works equally well by sound waves from a\nwaterfall. This is remarkable, since we use a completely different kind of\nwaves from the HBT case, the frequency of the waves differ by a factor $\\sim\n10^{12}$ and the wavelength as well as the angular extension of the source seen\nfrom the observer's position differ by a factor $\\sim 10^{7}$. The original HBT\npapers were based on measurements of \\emph{intensity} fluctuations recorded by\ntwo detectors and correlations between these signals. The starting point for\nthe theory that explained the effect was therefore intensity fluctuations per\nsee, and the theory is not easy to understand, at least not for an\nundergraduate physics student. Our starting point is descriptions of broadband\nwaves at the amplitude level (not at intensity level) by numerical modeling.\nImportant properties of broadband waves can easily be revealed and understood\nby numerical modeling, and time-resolved frequency analysis (TFA) based on\nMorlet wavelets turns out to be a very useful tool. In fact, we think it has\nbeen far too little attention to broadband waves in physics education hitherto,\nbut the growth of use of numerical methods in basic physics courses opens up\nnew possibilities.\n",

First,\nthey need to ensure their undergraduate students have a good grasp of the\nknowledge and skills of the intellectual field.

The problem addressed by this paper is how assessments may reveal a\nshift of focus from a mastery of knowledge to a work-focused orientation. This\nshift is examined through a case study of physics and the sub-discipline of\ntheoretical physics as intellectual fields. The evidence is assessment tasks\ngiven to students at different points of their studies from first year to\ndoctoral levels. By examining and analysing the assessment tasks using concepts\nfrom Legitimation Code Theory (LCT), we demonstrate how the shifts in the\nassessments incrementally lead students from a pure disciplinary focus to one\nthat enables students to potentially pursue employment both within and outside\nof academia. In doing so, we also highlight the usefulness of LCT as a\nframework for evaluating the preparation of science students for diverse\nworkplaces.\n",

        "summary": "  University buildings are significant closed built environments for COVID-19\nspreading. As universities prepare to re-start in-class activities, students'\nadherence to physical distancing requirements is a priority topic. While\nphysical distancing in classrooms can be easily managed, the movement of\nstudents inside common spaces can pose higher risks due to individuals'\nproximity. This paper provides an experimental analysis of unidirectional\nstudent flow inside a case-study university building, by investigating\nstudents' movements and grouping behaviour according to physical distancing\nrequirements. Results show general adherence with the minimum required physical\ndistancing guidance, but some spaces, such as corridors, pose higher exposure\nthan doorways. Their width, in combination with group behaviour, affects the\nstudents' capacity to keep the recommended distance. Furthermore, students\nreport higher perceived vulnerability while moving along corridors.\nEvidence-based results can support decision-makers in understanding\nindividuals' exposure in universities and researchers in developing behavioural\nmodels in preparation of future outbreaks and pandemics.\n",

We observed differences in student reasoning that were associated with\nprior or concurrent enrollment in IPLS. In particular, we found that IPLS\nstudents were more likely than non-IPLS students to reason quantitatively and\nmechanistically about diffusive phenomena, and to successfully coordinate\nbetween multiple representations of diffusive processes, even up to two years\nafter taking the IPLS course. Finally, we describe methodological challenges\nencountered in both this task and other tasks used in our longitudinal study.\n",

Here we\nreport our findings on life science students' ability to carry out a\nsophisticated biological modeling task at the end of first-semester\nintroductory physics. Some students were enrolled in a standard course (N =\n34), and some in an IPLS course (N = 61); both courses were taught with active\nlearning, used calculus, and included the same core physics concepts. Compared\nto those who took the standard course, we found that the IPLS students were\nsignificantly more successful at building a model that combined ideas in a\nmanner they had not previously seen, and at making complex decisions about how\nto apply an equation to a particular physical situation, although both groups\ndisplayed similar success at solving simpler problems. Both groups identified\nand applied simple models that they had previously used in very similar\ncontexts, and executed straightforward calculations, at statistically\nindistinguishable rates. We report both our findings and the rationale behind\nthe development of the task, in the hopes that others may find this task either\na valuable tool or a starting point to develop other such tasks. Further study\nis needed to determine the basis for the IPLS students' stronger\nperformance--namely, what aspects of the IPLS course supports these students to\nbe better prepared to do such modeling--as well as whether biological settings\nare important for IPLS students to succeed in flexible model building, and\nwhether the ability to employ models flexibly persists over time.\n",

Student learning data is collected from 70 online\nlearning modules assigned as both online homework and self-study material in\nboth Fall 2020 and Spring 2020 semesters, with the first 41 modules being\nassigned before campus closure in Spring 2020. Students' ability to stay on\ntrack is measured by three data indicators: percentage of modules submitted\nbefore the due date, percentage of modules submitted early for extra credit,\nand percentage of modules properly engaged with. The student population is\ndivided into two demographic groups according to each of the four demographic\nvariables: Gender, Ethnicity, Transfer Status and First generation status. All\nthree data indicators from both semesters are first compared between each pair\nof demographic groups within the same semester, and then compared within the\nsame group between the two semesters. Exam and course scores are also compared\nbetween demographics groups in Fall 2020 and against scores from the Fall 2019\nsemester. The analysis revealed that remote learning significantly reduced\non-time and early submission for first-generation students, but increased the\nfrequency of early submission for transfer students. Under-represented minority\nstudents had higher percentage of engaged modules during the pandemic, while\nnon-URM students had the same level of module engagement before and after the\npandemic. These results suggest that pandemic remote learning had very\ndifferent impact for students with different demographic background, and future\ninstructional design should strive to provide more flexible options to meet the\nvarious needs for a diverse higher-ed student population.\n",

V to LED T. V etc. Human being\nhas perceived the huge revolution especially in the field of communication. We\nreport on the simulation study of Microstrip patch antenna using Comsol\nMultiphysics 5.4 software. Transmitter, feed point, receiver, modulation are\nthe several parameters which are most important during the fabrication of\nantenna. In this paper we explain the geometry, radiation patterns in E plane\nand H plane, scattering parameters, resonant frequency, bandwidth of microstrip\npatch antenna. In research field lot of work is done on antenna by many of the\nscientists but there is a challenge about the compactness of antenna.\nMicrostrip patch antenna is much compact than other antennas and these types of\nantennas are used in our mobile. It attains the greater number of frequency\nbands, improved gain, better impedance matching and improved bandwidth. In this\npaper, frequency response of Microstrip Patch Antenna shows single band\nbehaviour at frequency 1.575 GHz which gives improvement in reflection\ncoefficient and wider bandwidth.\n",

In this paper, we examine simple models for International\nSpace Station (ISS) and airplane flying and identify the inertial forces\ninvolved and their effect. In both cases there are centrifugal forces but in\nthe case of the ISS, the centrifugal force is the only major force opposing the\ngravitational attraction that is pulling it towards the Earth at 0.885 the\ngravity at the surface of the Earth. While in the case of an airplane, it is a\nminor component amounting to less than 1% in the best case of flying along the\nequator west to east. Other inertial forces including the Coriolis force affect\nthe airplane. Another thing we see is that flying with the Earth direction west\nto east gives a markedly higher forces than flying in the opposite direction.\nThe maintenance of the ISS orientation with respect to Earth requires rotation\nof ISS around its center of gravity (cg) at the same rate as it revolves around\nthe Earth (4 degrees per minute) while for an airplane, maintaining level\nflight at a constant speed and height does not require direct intervention\nbecause the amount of adjustment is so small and gradual that it is handled by\nthe pilot system as a part of the disturbances that affects the airplane.\n",

For instance, Faraday's law allows computing the induced electric\ncurrent on a closed circuit in terms of the variation of the flux of a magnetic\nfield across the surface spanned by the circuit. The key point for applying\nStokes' theorem is that this surface must be orientable. Many students wonder\nwhat happens to the flux through a surface when this is not orientable, as it\nhappens with a M\\\"obius strip. On an orientable surface one can compute the\nflux of a solenoidal field using Stokes' theorem in terms of the circulation of\nthe vector potential of the field along the oriented boundary of the surface.\nBut this cannot be done if the surface is not orientable, though in principle\nthis quantity could be measured on a laboratory. For instance, checking the\ninduced electric current on a circuit along the boundary of a surface if the\nfield is a variable magnetic field. We shall see that the answer to this puzzle\nis simple and the problem lies in the question rather than in the answer.\n",

Computational\nessays are a genre of scientific writing that combine live, executable computer\ncode with narrative text to present a computational model or analysis. The\nstudy took place across two contrasting university contexts: an\ninterdisciplinary data science and modeling course at Michigan State\nUniversity, USA, and a third-semester physics course at the University of Oslo,\nNorway. Over the course of a semester, computational essays were simultaneously\nand independently used in both courses, and comparable datasets of student\nartifacts and retrospective interviews were collected from both student\npopulations. These data were analyzed using a framework which operationalized\nthe construct of epistemic agency across the dimensions of programming,\ninquiry, data analysis and modeling, and communication. Based on this analysis,\nwe argue that computational essays can be a useful tool in redistributing\nepistemic agency to students within higher education science due to their\ncombination of adaptability and disciplinary authenticity. However, we also\nargue that educational contexts, scaffolding, expectations, and student\nbackgrounds can constrain and influence the ways in which students choose to\ntake up epistemic agency.\n",

This is the motivating property behind\noptical phenomena such as Reflection and Refraction. The unreasonable economic\nefficiency of light is captured by a single proposition: the Principle of Least\nAction (PLA) in Optics. The PLA can be difficult for students to comprehend\nbecause unlike reflection and refraction, which emerge from optimizing a\none-dimensional function, the PLA emerges from optimizing an\ninfinite-dimensional functional. Furthermore, students may be confused by the\nformulation of the Lagrangian, or the counterintuitive paths generated by the\nPLA. To address these difficulties, this paper presents three simulations which\ndemonstrate the PLA in Optics. Simulations have proven to be effective\npedagogical tools in making mathematical abstractions such as the Action\naccessible to undergraduate students. The three simulations in this paper are\nas follows: light reflecting in equal angles, light refracting through\ndifferent mediums, and light traveling the path of least time in an arbitrary\nrefractive profile. We then consider the famous Brachistochrone problem as a\nspecial case of the third simulation.

This paper builds on this work and investigates equity\ngaps occurring under both scales. By employing a \"Course Deficit Model\" we\nattribute the responsibility for closing the gaps to those who are responsible\nfor the policies that guide the course. When comparing course grades in classes\ngraded using the percent scale with those in courses graded using the 4.0\nscale, we find that students identifying as belonging to racial or ethnic\nminorities underrepresented in physics suffer a grade penalty under both grade\nscales but suffer an extra penalty under percent scale graded courses. We then\nuse the fraction of A grades each student earns on individual exam items as a\nproxy for the instructor's perception of each student's understanding of the\ncourse material to control for student understanding and find that the extra\ngrade penalty students from groups underrepresented in physics students suffer\nunder percent scale grading is independent of the student's understanding of\nphysics. When we control for more student level variables to determine the\nsource of the grade scale dependent penalty, we find that it is primarily the\nlow F grades (partial credit scores) on exam problems that are the source of\nthese inequities. We present an argument that switching from percent scale\ngrading to a 4.0 grade scale (or similar grades scale) could reduce equity gaps\nby 20-25\\% without making any other course changes or controlling for any\nincoming differences between students.\n",

Here, students attended hybrid sessions to\ntest whether the effects of collaboration found on the first study were stable\nthroughout two semesters. Following the same procedures as in the exploratory\nphase, we found that the initial effects of collaboration on grades are\nnegative for all collaborative variables, while strong working ties afford\nacademic gains later into the year.

        "summary": "  The metaliteracy ability is a very important in today's life, especially to\nlive in the disruptive technology era. Metaliteracy is an ability that goes\nbeyond metacognition and technological literacy. However, the students'\nmetalliteracy ability is still relatively low. One of the causes of the low\nability is due to the learning model that has been applied so far has not been\nable to bring out this ability. Therefore, in this study, an RBL learning model\nthat is integrated with the STEM approach will be applied in solving the\nr-Dynamic coloring problem. By r-dynamic coloring, we mean a proper k-coloring\nc of G if for every vertex v in V (G) satisfies the number of neighbours color\nis greater then min{r,d(v)}. The minimum k such that G has an r-dynamic\ncoloring with k colors is called an r-dynamic chromatic number, denoted by\nr(G). By using the r-dynamic coloring technique, we will improve students'\nmetaliteracy in solving the tessellation decoration problem. Therefore, in this\nresearch, the syntax of learning activities of the Research-Based Learning and\nSTEM approach will be developed including the assesment indicator of the\nmetaliteracy ability.\n",

Among numerous activities that theorists described, here we elucidate\ntwo activities that theorists commonly characterized as being integral to their\nwork: making assumptions and using analogies. Theorists described making\nassumptions throughout their research process, especially while setting their\nproject's direction and goals, establishing their model's interaction with\nmathematics, and revising their model while troubleshooting. They described how\nassumptions about their model informed their mathematical decision making, as\nwell as instances where mathematical steps fed back into their model's\napplicability.

However, large variations in learning outcomes between individual\neducational games exists. Research on the design process and different design\nelements of educational games has led to some interesting directions, but some\ndesign aspects remain unclear. We examined how an educational game designed on\nthe basis of intrinsic integration theory, based on a strong alignment between\ngame and learning goals, supports the learning of Newtonian mechanics. This\nstudy applied a mixed methods approach. An pre and posttest design was used to\nexamine possible learning and transfer effects fostered by playing the\neducational game, Newtons Race. To examine how players played the game, log\ndata of each player was digitally recorded during gameplay. Our findings\ndemonstrated a significant positive learning effect of Newtons Race. This\nfinding can be explained with acquired log data. Log data show that players\ngameplay mostly matched expected learning during the game, with physically\ncorrect game settings occurring more and more as gameplay progressed. The\nability to transfer learned knowledge onto other situations was shown to be\nlimited to situations closely resembling the game environment. Similar designed\nintrinsically integrated games on different (physics) subjects could also\nfoster learning in a relative short time. In order to foster transfer to other\nsituations we propose embedding the game within other instructional activities.\n",

Due to the vast number of explanatory videos available online,\ne.g. on YouTube, finding videos of high explaining quality is a challenging\ntask for learners, teachers, and lecturers alike. Prior research on the\nexplaining quality of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics has\nuncovered that the surface features provided by YouTube (e.g. number of views\nor likes) do not seem to be suitable indicators of the videos' explaining\nquality. Instead, the number of content-related comments was found to be\nstatistically significantly correlated with the explaining quality. To date,\nthese findings have only been observed in the context of explanatory videos on\nclassical mechanics topics. The question arises whether similar correlations\nbetween the explaining quality and YouTube surface features can be found for\nvideos on topics that are difficult to access visually and verbally, for\nexample from quantum physics. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study\nanalyzing the explaining quality of N = 60 YouTube videos on quantum\nentanglement and tunnelling. To this end, we made use of a category-based\nmeasure of explanatory videos' explaining quality from the literature. We\nreport correlations between the videos' explaining quality, and the surface\nfeatures provided by YouTube. On the one hand, our results substantiate earlier\nfindings for mechanics topics.

We used\nthese assessments to interview undergraduate students with a wide range of math\nskills. Interview analysis provided validity evidence for the cognitive model.\nIt also revealed that students tend to perform at the same level across\ndifferent disciplinary contexts, suggesting that blended MSS is a distinct\ncognitive construct, independent of specific disciplinary context.

        "summary": "  Discipline-based education researchers produce knowledge that aims to help\ninstructors improve student learning and educational outcomes. Yet, the\ninformation produced may not even reach the educators it is intended to\ninfluence. Prior work has found that instructors often face barriers to\nimplementing practices in peer-reviewed literature. Some of these barriers are\nrelated to accessing the knowledge in the first place such as difficulty\nfinding and understanding research and a lack of time to do so. To lower these\nbarriers, we created an online blog, PERbites, that summarizes recent\ndiscipline-based education research in short posts that use plain language.\nHaving covered nearly 100 papers to date, we conducted a survey to see if we\nwere addressing the need we had originally set out to address. We posted a\n23-item survey on our website and received 24 usable responses. The results\nsuggested that readers do generally agree that we are meeting our original\ngoals. Readers reported that our articles were easier to understand and used\nmore plain language than a typical discipline-based education research (DBER)\njournal article. At the same time, readers thought that all the important\ninformation was still included. Finally, readers said that this approach helped\nthem keep up with DBER studies and read about papers they otherwise would not\nhave. However, most readers did not indicate they changed their teaching and\nresearch practice as a result of reading our blog. Our results suggest that\nalternative methods of sharing research (e.g., non-peer reviewed publications\nor conference talks) can be an effective method of connecting research with\npractitioners, and future work should consider how we as a community might\nbuild on these efforts to ensure education research can make meaningful changes\nin the classroom.\n",

Hoping to better understand these initiatives' mechanisms of\nsuccess, we analyze the results of two surveys administered to a faculty online\nlearning community teaching a common physics curriculum designed primarily for\npre-service elementary teachers. We use social network analysis to represent\nthe faculty network and compare members' centrality, a family of measures that\ncapture the prominence of individuals within a network, to their reported\nexperience in the community. We use a principal component analysis of different\ncentrality measures to show that closeness, a measure of how closely connected\na person is with every other person in their network, is the most appropriate\ncentrality measure for our network. We then compare regression models according\nto Bayes factors to find relationships between participants' closeness and\ntheir survey responses. We find that participants' self-efficacy, as well as\ntheir sense of improvement to their teaching and sense of benefitting from the\ncommunity, are predictors of their closeness with other participants and thus\ntheir breadth and depth of participation in the community. Our results are\nconsistent with other studies that have highlighted interactions among faculty\nas key components of successful professional development initiatives.

We analyze networks, constructed\nfrom student self-reports of collaboration on homework assignments, in two\ncourses from the University of Colorado Boulder and one course from the\nColorado School of Mines. All three courses occurred during the COVID-19\npandemic, which allows for a comparison between the course at the Colorado\nSchool of Mines (in a fully remote format) with results from a previous\npre-pandemic study of student collaboration at the Colorado School of Mines (in\na hybrid format). We compute nodal centrality measures and calculate the\ncorrelation between student centrality and performance. Results varied widely\nbetween each of the courses studied. The course at the Colorado School of Mines\nhad strong correlations between many centrality measures and performance which\nmatched the patterns seen in the pre-pandemic study. The courses at the\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder showed weaker correlations, and one course\nshowed nearly no correlations at all between students' connectivity to their\nclassmates and their performance. Taken together, the results from the trio of\ncourses indicate that the context and environment in which the course is\nsituated play a more important role in fostering a correlation between student\ncollaboration and course performance than the format (remote, hybrid,\nin-person) of the course. Additionally, we conducted a short study on the\neffect that missing nodes may have on the correlations calculated from the\nmeasured networks. This investigation showed that missing nodes tend to shift\ncorrelations towards zero, providing evidence that the statistically\nsignificant correlations measured in our networks are not spurious.\n",

The intentional process of\ndeveloping a pre-/post-quiz for every course focuses the educator on the\nessential understanding desired of the learners exiting the course. The\nnormalized-gain statistics for the course can then be used to evaluate the\ncourse's efficacy, and improvements to the curriculum can be monitored by\ntracking the normalized gains over time, using the same pre-/post-quiz.\nMoreover, an individual instructor may self-evaluate their teaching efficacy by\ntracking normalized gains from all courses over time.

        "summary": "  Fundamental big-picture challenges face the enterprise of burgeoning space\ntest, which may also have an impact on the syllabus and training of a possible\nfuture Space Test Pilot School. Test fundamentals and test conduct under\nstresses of time and fuel will be where the rubber meets the road. This paper\nspecifically discusses four of those challenges, and their impact on US Space\nForce operators. (1) Testing limits of space capabilities. Space vehicles have\ntraditionally imposed very strict operating limits. A culture shift from the\ntop-down will be required before space testers are allowed to test spacecraft\nlimits as freely as air-breathing test pilots do today. (2) Permitted\nprocedures. There are a limited number of contingency procedures at a space\noperator's disposal, further constrained within themselves. (3) Safety nets. A\ndiscussion of space-specific methods that mitigate risks in operations, and the\nneed for more agile fault-detection. (4) Operator proficiency. The\nqualifications and recency of a tester at the controls must be considered in\nthe context of a single misstep potentially resulting in the entire asset being\nlost. We suggest that hours in high-risk test per spacecraft may become the\ndefining factor for high-risk space test execution.\n",

        "summary": "  As quantum information science and technology (QIST) is becoming more\nprevalent and occurring not only in research labs but also in industry, many\neducators are considering how best to incorporate learning about quantum\nmechanics into various levels of education. Although much of the focus has been\non quantum concepts in non-lab courses, current work in QIST has a substantial\nexperimental component. Many instructors of undergraduate lab courses want to\nprovide their students the opportunity to work with quantum experiments. One\ncommon way this is done is through a sequence of quantum optics experiments\noften referred to as the ``single-photon experiments.'' These experiments\ndemonstrate fundamental quantum phenomena with equipment common to research\nlabs; however, they are resource intensive and cannot be afforded by all\ninstitutions. It is therefore imperative to know what unique affordances these\nexperiments provide to students. As a starting point, we surveyed and\ninterviewed instructors who use the single-photon experiments in undergraduate\ncourses, asking how and why they use the experiments. We describe the most\ncommonly used experiments in both quantum and beyond-first-year lab courses,\nthe prevalence of actions the students perform, and the learning goals, ranging\nfrom conceptual knowledge to lab skills to student affect. Finally, we present\nsome strategies from these data demonstrating how instructors have addressed\nthe common challenges of preparing students to work with conceptually and\ntechnically complex experiments and balancing the practice of technical skills\nwith the completion of the experiments.\n",

Discussed from a military perspective, but\napplicable across the space industry, there are three critical aspects of\nfoundational training: (1) Realistic trainers and simulators: Representative\nsimulators are the safest way to gain repetitions in dynamic decision-making,\nsatellite envelope expansion, fault response, and to develop ways to operate\nthrough a contested, degraded, and operationally limited (CDO) environment.\nThis paper introduces a new term encompassing the variables of space maneuver\n(GET CLASS) as a standard for US Space Force training simulators; (2)\nInteroperable Software Tools: Adapt to new software tools without reliance on a\nchecklist. Common standards and interfaces must be developed and enforced; and\n(3) Cross-functional networking: Operations, test, engineering, and program\nmanagement communities must work hand-in-hand to deliver effective\ncapabilities.

Overall, 94 interviews were conducted with paired\nparticipants; mentees (N=10) and mentors (N=8) from six different REU programs.\nBy drawing on Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a framework, our\nstudy uncovers some of the challenges for mentees around the accomplishment of\ntheir research objectives and academic goals. These challenges included\nmotivation, limited access to technologies at home, limited communication among\nREU students, barriers in mentor-mentee relationships, and differing\nexpectations about doing research. Despite the challenges, all mentees reported\nthat this experience was highly beneficial. Comparisons between outcomes of\nthese remote REUs and published outcomes of in-person undergraduate research\nprograms reveal many similar benefits such as integrating students into STEM\nculture. Our study suggests that remote research programs could be considered\nas a means to expand access to research experiences for undergraduate students\neven after COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted.\n",

This paper uses data from a 2019 survey of 1176 physics\ninstructors to understand the current state of RBIS use in college-level\nintroductory physics, thus allowing us to better understand some of the impacts\nof these efforts on physics instruction. Results show that self-reported\nknowledge and use of RBISs has increased considerably and discontinuation is\nnow relatively low. However, although the percentage of time lecturing is less\nthan 10 years ago, many instructors still engage in substantial lecturing.\nRelatedly, we find that the majority of RBIS use centers on pedagogies designed\nto supplement traditional lecture rather than pedagogies designed to supplement\nan active learning classroom. This suggests that the PER community and beyond\nhas done well promoting knowledge about RBISs and inspiring instructors to try\nRBISs in their courses. But, there is still room to improve.

This transition had a very\nuneven impact given the significant digital divide between rural and urban\nIndia and the unequal distribution of digital resources in different\ninstitutions. Access to resources varied substantially by individual, based on\nsocioeconomic factors as well as gender. Institutional support to the academic\ncommunity during this critical period was largely inadequate, which has had\nserious consequences on the teaching of physics and other subjects that require\nlaboratory instruction. Educational institutions also provide safe and enabling\nlearning spaces for women students; reduced access to such facilities\nundermined the work- and study-related dynamics for women because of the\nscarcity of resources such as devices, data, and time. This paper reports on\nefforts made towards understanding such challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic\nand describes steps that were taken to address them.\n",

We also uniquely evaluate possible\nracial/ethnic biases and probe the relationship between instructional context\n(whether lecture or laboratory) and recognition.

Many\nstudies have quantified patterns of student interactions in in-person physics\ncourses using social network analysis, finding different network structures\nbetween instructional contexts (lecture and lab) and styles (active and\ntraditional). Such studies also find inconsistent results as to whether and how\nstudent-level variables (e.g., grades and demographics) relate to the formation\nof interaction networks. In this cross-sectional research study, we investigate\nthese relationships further by examining lecture and lab interaction networks\nin four different remote physics courses spanning various instructional styles\nand student populations. We apply statistical methods from social network\nanalysis -- exponential random graph models -- to measure the relationship\nbetween network formation and multiple variables: students' discussion and lab\nsection enrollment, final course grades, gender, and race/ethnicity. Similar to\nprevious studies of in-person courses, we find that remote lecture interaction\nnetworks contain large clusters connecting many students, while remote lab\ninteraction networks contain smaller clusters of a few students. Our\nstatistical analysis suggests that these distinct network structures arise from\na combination of both instruction-level and student-level variables, including\nthe learning goals of each instructional context, whether assignments are\ncompleted in groups or individually, and the distribution of gender and major\nof students enrolled in a course.

However, the experimental setups that are commonly used to\nsimultaneously acquire both oscillation types can be cumbersome and/or costly,\noften requiring two synchronised cameras, or motion sensors and photo-gates\nintegrated by an expensive analog-to-digital converter. Here, we show that a\nsmartphone can be the perfect device for recording the oscillations of a\nWilberforce pendulum composed of just an educational helical spring and a can.\nOur setup employs a smartphone's accelerator and gyroscope to acquire data from\nthe longitudinal and torsional oscillations, respectively.

Video lectures and\nweb-based virtual experiments were utilized to provide students enrolled in\nthese laboratories with required learning materials on a weekly basis. During\nthe fall semester of the 2021-2022 academic year, optional Kahoot! quizzes were\noffered in addition, serving to incentivize participation and to provide\nself-efficacy opportunities to students. This study sought to explore the\nintersection of self-efficacy growth, self-regulatory behaviors, and\nintelligence mindsets (i.e., having fixed or growth mindsets) for students and\nto examine the impact of these remote learning methods. Using a modified\nversion of the Colorado Learning Attitudes About Science Survey (CLASS),\nstudents' physics self-efficacy was measured at the beginning and end of the\nsemester. The analysis revealed that participation in Kahoot! alone did not\ncorrespond to greater self-efficacy scores or greater self-efficacy change.\nHowever, a strong correlation was observed between intelligence mindset and\nself-efficacy for both pre-and post-surveys. Pre-survey intelligence mindset\nscores were not related to average Kahoot! performance, while post-survey\nintelligence mindsets were. Finally, positive self-efficacy change $\\langle c\n\\rangle$ was measured for the class, but was not statistically significant.\n",

Using four years of PR data involving millions of\nproblem attempts by thousands of students, we quantify benefits of increased\npractice study volume in introductory physics. After conditioning mean final\ngrade on standardized (ACT/SAT) math test score, we analyze deviations based on\nstudent study volume. We find a strong effect; mean course grade rises\nquadratically with the logarithm of the total number of PR questions\nencountered over the term ($N_{\\rm Q,tot}$), with an overall gain of $0.77 \\pm\n0.12$ grade points between $1 < N_{\\rm Q,tot} < 1000$. The gains are persistent\nacross the range of math test score represented in our sample. While $N_{\\rm\nQ,tot}$ surely correlates with other study habits, the benefits of increased\nstudy in general still hold. A model for final grade using test score and study\nvolume largely accounts for demographic stratification, including by sex,\nparental education level, number of parents at home, nationality /\nunderrepresented minority status, and regional income level, with two\nsignificant exceptions: students whose parents did not earn a college degree,\nwho earn $-0.27 \\pm 0.04$ grade points ($6.1\\sigma$) below expectations and\nunderrepresented minority students at $-0.14 \\pm 0.04$ points ($3.6\\sigma$).\nResidual scatter in final grade remains comparable to the maximal study gains,\nimplying that the model is far from deterministic: individual variation trumps\nmean trends. Our findings can help motivate students to study more and help\nteachers to identify which types of students may especially need such\nencouragement.\n",

This study focuses on\nthe science education of pre-service elementary teachers with the goal of\nimproving their attitudes before they begin their professional lives as\nclassroom teachers. Specifically, this study builds on a small body of research\nto examine whether exposure to inquiry-based science content courses that\nactively involve students in the collaborative process of learning and\ndiscovery can promote a positive change in attitudes toward science across\nseveral different dimensions. To examine this issue, surveys and administrative\ndata were collected from over 200 students enrolled in the Hands-on-Science\n(HoS) program for pre-service teachers at the University of Texas at Austin, as\nwell as more than 200 students in a comparison group enrolled in traditional\nlecture-style classes. Quantitative analyses reveal that after participating in\nHoS courses, pre-service teachers significantly increased their scores on\nscales measuring confidence, enjoyment, anxiety, and perceptions of relevance,\nwhile those in the comparison group experienced a decline in favorable\nattitudes to science. These patterns offer empirical support for the\nattitudinal benefits of inquiry-based instruction and have implications for the\nfuture learning opportunities available to students at all education levels.\n",

Especially in quantum\ntechnology education, the ability to employ such practices is an essential\nskill to foster both academic success and technological development. In order\nto help educators design effective instructions, the comparison between\nnovices' and experts' eye movements allows the identification of efficient\ninformation extraction and integration strategies. In this work, we compare the\ngaze behavior of experts and novices while solving problems in quantum physics\nusing an interactive simulation tool, Quantum Composer, which displays\ninformation via multiple external representations (numerical values, equations,\ngraphs). During two reasoning tasks, we found that metarepresentational\ncompetences were crucial for successful engagement with the simulation tool.\nThe analysis of the gaze behavior revealed that visual attention on a graph\nplays a major role and redundant numerical information is ignored. Furthermore,\nthe total dwell time on relevant and irrelevant areas is predictive for the\nscore in the second task. Therefore, the results demonstrate which difficulties\nnovices encounter when using simulation tools and provides insights for how to\ndesign effective instructions in quantum technology education guided by\nexperts' gaze behavior.\n",

However,\ndata acquisition can be challenging, particularly when direct cable connections\nare not feasible or difficult to establish. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod for measuring instrument data acquisition utilizing a camera to capture\nthe instrument display and image processing techniques to extract the measured\nvalues. Our method combines computer vision and machine learning techniques to\nrecognize and extract numerical values from the instrument display. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of this approach by applying it to\ncapture the magnetic field of a permanent magnet using a gauss meter and\nwebcam. Our results indicate that the proposed method offers a practical and\naccurate solution for data acquisition in cases where direct cable connections\nare not possible.

SPRUCE is a pre-post assessment\ninstrument intended for use in introductory (first- and second-year) physics\nlab courses to help instructors and researchers identify student strengths and\nchallenges with measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we discuss the\ndevelopment of SPRUCE's assessment items guided by Evidence-Centered Design,\nfocusing on how instructors' and researchers' assessment priorities were\nincorporated into the assessment items and how students' reasoning from pilot\ntesting informed decisions around item answer options. We also present an\nexample of some of the feedback an instructor would receive after implementing\nSPRUCE in a pre-post fashion, along with a brief discussion of how that\nfeedback could be interpreted and acted upon.\n",

Consequently, investigations in\nphysics education research have extensively developed and analyzed assessments\nthat support students sensemaking of their surrounding world. In the current\nwork, we complement contemporary efforts by theoretically exploring assessment\ntask features that increase the likelihood of students sensemaking in physics.\nWe identify the task features by first noting the salient characteristics of\nthe sensemaking process as described in the science education literature. We\nthen leverage existing theoretical ideas from cognitive psychology, education,\nand philosophy of science in unpacking the task features which elicit the\ncharacteristics of sensemaking. Furthermore, we leverage Conjecture Mapping --\na framework from design-based research -- to articulate how the proposed task\nfeatures elicit the desired outcome of sensemaking. We argue that to promote\nsensemaking, tasks should cue students to unpack the underlying mechanism of a\nreal-world phenomenon by coordinating multiple representations and by\nphysically interpreting mathematical expressions. Major contributions of this\nwork include: adopting an agent-based approach to explore task features;\noperationalizing conjecture mapping in the context of task design in physics;\nleveraging cross-disciplinary theoretical ideas to promote sensemaking in\nphysics; and introducing a methodology extendable to unpack task features which\ncan elicit other valued epistemic practices such as modeling and argumentation.\n",

We present a general analysis approach through which this\nstraightforward experiment can be used to create a reasonably advanced\ncomputational orbital mechanics lab at the undergraduate level, creating a\nconvenient hands-on, computational pathway to various non-trivial nuances in\nthis discipline, such as the mean, eccentric, and true anomalies and their\ncomputation, Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector conservation, characterization of\ngeneral orbits, and the extraction of orbital parameters.

Prior\nresearch suggests that students' self-efficacy and interest play an important\nrole in their performance and persistence in STEM fields. However, very little\nhas been investigated about the role of perceived recognition and validation by\ninstructors on students' self-efficacy and interest. Moreover, prior\nquantitative studies show that women often report a lower level of physics\nperceived recognition, self-efficacy and interest. In this study, we analyzed\ndata from individual interviews with 38 female students to investigate their\nlearning experiences in physics courses in order to obtain a qualitative\nunderstanding of the factors that shape their self-efficacy and interest. We\nfind that female students' negative and positive perceived recognition from\ninstructors and teaching assistants (TAs) greatly influenced their\nself-efficacy and interest and even impacted their desire to persist in STEM\nmajors. We categorize different types of perceived recognition that women\nreported in our interviews and how they influenced them. For example, many\nwomen reported that they felt belittled for their questions or efforts in\nphysics courses, which often negatively influenced their self-efficacy. These\nfindings can help physics educators develop better ways to interact with\nstudents in order to provide positive recognition and validation, such as\nacknowledging students' efforts and questions, expressing faith in students'\nability to excel, and being careful not to give unintended messages to\nstudents. Our research also suggests that it is important for instructors/TAs\nto note that it is not their intentions that matter but the impact they are\nhaving on their students.\n",

Graphs are one of the best ways to learn to build the blend.\nThey are a mathematical representation that builds on visual recognition to\ncreate a bridge between words and equations. But students in introductory\nphysics classes often see a graph as an endpoint, a task the teacher asks them\nto complete, rather than as a tool to help them make sense of a physical\nsystem. And most of the graph problems in traditional introductory physics\ntexts simply ask students to extract a number from a graph.

There are various approaches\nbut the general pattern is to encourage students to measure ordered pairs, plot\na graph to establish linear dependence, and then compute the slope of the\nbest-fit line for an eventual scientific conclusion. To assist educators when\nthey also want to include slope uncertainty dependent upon measurement\nuncertainty as part of the expected analysis, we demonstrate a physical\napproach so that both educators and their students have a convenient roadmap to\nfollow. A popular alternative that educators often choose is to rely solely on\nstatistical metrics to establish the tolerance of the technique, but we argue\nthe statistical strategy can distract students away from the true meaning of\nthe uncertainty that is inherent in the act of making the measurements. We will\ncarry these measurement error bars from their points of origin through the\nregression analysis to consistently establish the physical error bars for the\nslope and the intercept.

SEM models\nare typically constructed based on theoretical foundations and assessed through\nfit indices. However, a well-fitting SEM model alone is not sufficient to\nverify the causal inferences underlying the proposed model, as there are\nstatistically equivalent models with distinct causal structures that equally\nwell fit the data. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers using SEM to\nconsider statistically equivalent models and to clarify why the proposed model\nis more accurate than the equivalent ones. However, many SEM studies did not\nexplicitly address this important step, and no prior study in physics education\nresearch has delved into potential methods for distinguishing statistically\nequivalent models with differing causal structures. In this study, we use\nphysics identity model as an example to discuss the importance of considering\nstatistically equivalent models and how other data can help to distinguish\nthem. Previous research has identified three dimensions of physics identity:\nperceived recognition, self-efficacy, and interest. However, the relationships\nbetween these dimensions have not been thoroughly understood. In this paper, we\nspecify a model with perceived recognition predicting self-efficacy and\ninterest, which is inspired by individual interviews with students in physics\ncourses to make physics learning environments equitable and inclusive. We test\nour model with fit indices and discuss its statistically equivalent models with\ndifferent causal inferences among perceived recognition, self-efficacy, and\ninterest. We then discuss potential experiments that could further empirically\ntest the causal inferences underlying the models, aiding the refinement to a\nmore accurate causal model for guiding educational improvements.\n",

Each question was\npresented with four different responses. All responses were attributed to\nChatGPT, but in reality one sample solution was created by the researchers. All\nChatGPT responses obtained in this study were wrong, imprecise, incomplete, or\nmisleading. We found little differences in the perceived linguistic quality\nbetween ChatGPT responses and the sample solution. However, the students rated\nthe overall scientific accuracy of the responses significantly differently,\nwith the sample solution being rated best for the questions of low and medium\ndifficulty. The discrepancy between the sample solution and the ChatGPT\nresponses increased with the level of self-assessed knowledge of the question\ncontent. For the question of highest difficulty (fluid dynamics) that was\nunknown to most students, a ChatGPT response was rated just as good as the\nsample solution. Thus, this study provides data on the students' perception of\nChatGPT responses and the factors influencing their perception.

        "summary": "  Background: Context Based Science Education (CBSE) has a long-standing\ntradition and is discussed as a highly promising approach in science education.\nIt is supposed that CBSE can foster pupils engagement and learning. However,\nclassroom implementations of CBSE based on solid empirical evidence are\nsurprisingly scarce.\n  Purpose: The present research-based report of practice seeks to bridge this\ntheory practice gap for some specific forms of CBSE. We examine the use of\nscience problems based on newspaper articles and the real-life contexts they\nprovide (newspaper story problems, NSP).\n  Design and Methods: While the research background has been reported\nelsewhere, the main objective of the present contribution is to provide a\ndetailed account of the practical aspects of the approach. Two concrete,\ncurriculum-relevant classroom teaching experiments based on newspaper story\nproblems are reported, combined with a quasi-experimental study comparing NSPs\nagainst conventional textbook problems. The implementation of the teaching\nlearning sequence in classroom practice is described in detail. Additionally,\ntasks types similar to NSPs, but using other ways of contextualisation (e.g.\nadvertisements) will be discussed as perspective.\n  Results: A considerable improvement in motivation was found, which proved\nstable at least in the medium term. Learning turned out to also be fostered to\na sizeable extent, including the educationally important issue of transfer.\n  Conclusions: The use of NSPs as a form of CBSE can have large positive,\nrobust, and sustainable effects of both motivation and learning. Being flexible\nand practical to implement, they appear thus highly suited to classroom\napplication. In perspective, a series of similar forms of tasks implementing\nCBSE is presented, such as by experimental of aesthetic contexts.\n",

Unfortunately, providing\nmeaningful feedback on written derivations is much more labor and resource\nintensive than only grading the outcome: currently, the latter can be done by\ncomputer, while the former involves handwritten solutions that need to be\ngraded by humans. This exploratory study proposes an AI-assisted workflow for\ngrading written physics-problem solutions, and it evaluates the viability of\nthe actual grading step using GPT-4. It is found that the AI-tool is capable of\nproviding feedback that can be helpful in formative assessment scenarios, but\nthat for summative scenarios, particularly those that are high-stakes, it\nshould only be used for an initial round of grading that sorts and flags\nsolution approaches.\n",

I mean, what do you actually do?\" This is one of the most\ncommon questions one theoretical physicist receives from her students, and is\nrepresentative of a common curiosity among aspiring physicists. Students often\nmisunderstand what different types of physicists actually do. For many, the\nterm \"theoretical physicist\" likely conjures mental images of Einstein,\nFeynman, or Sheldon Cooper discerning the underlying operating principles of\nthe universe, armed with only pencil and paper. Such imagery is representative\nof the \"lone genius\" stereotype many students ascribe to physicists. However,\nthis common perception of physicists is known to discourage students,\nparticularly underrepresented gender and racial groups, from pursuing it as a\ncareer. Moreover, students of all demographic backgrounds may avoid physics if\nthey feel they do not understand what different kinds of physicists do on a\ndaily basis. Therefore, providing students with an accurate depiction of the\nskills, practices, motivations, and daily routines in different types physics\ncareers is essential for helping them make decisions about their future. In\nthis article, we offer students a glimpse into what a career in theoretical\nphysics is like. Through interviews with 11 practicing theoretical physics\nfaculty, we reveal a variety of misconceptions theorists believe students hold\nabout their work.

This understanding of what is taking place, or\nepistemic framing, may impact their behaviors in the lab, either productively\nor unproductively. In this paper, we present an analysis of student epistemic\nframing in a nontraditional lab to understand how instructional context,\nspecifically instructor behaviors, may shape student framing. We present video\ndata from a lab section taught by an experienced teaching assistant (TA), with\n19 students working in seven groups. We argue that student framing in this lab\nis evidenced by whether or not students articulate experimental predictions and\nby the extent to which they take up opportunities to construct knowledge\n(epistemic agency). We show that the TA's attempts to shift student frames\ngenerally succeed with respect to experimental predictions but are less\nsuccessful with respect to epistemic agency. In part, we suggest, the success\nof the TA's attempts reflects whether and how they are responsive to students'\ncurrent framing. This work offers evidence that instructors can shift students'\nframes in nontraditional labs, while also illuminating the complexities of both\nstudent framing and the role of the instructor in shifting that framing in this\ncontext.\n",

However, research has also found a gender bias in peer recognition in\nwhich student nominations of strong peers in their physics course\ndisproportionately favor men over women. In this study, we draw on methods from\nsocial network analysis and find a consistent gender bias in which men\ndisproportionately under-nominate women as strong in their physics course in\ntwo offerings of both a lecture course (for science and engineering, but not\nphysics, majors) and a distinct lab course (for science, engineering, and\nphysics majors). We also find in one offering of the lecture course that women\ndisproportionately under-nominate men, contrary to what previous research would\npredict. We expand on prior work by also probing two data sources related to\nwho and what gets recognized in peer recognition: students' interactions with\ntheir peers (who gets recognized) and students' written explanations of their\nnominations of strong peers (what gets recognized). Results suggest that the\nnature of the observed gender bias in peer recognition varies between the\ninstructional contexts of lecture and lab. In the lecture course, the gender\nbias is related to who gets recognized: both men and women disproportionately\nover-nominate their interaction ties to students of their same gender as strong\nin the course. In the lab course, the gender bias is also related to what gets\nrecognized: men nominate men more than women because of skills related to\ninteractions, such as being helpful. These findings illuminate the different\nways in which students form perceptions of their peers and add nuance to our\nunderstanding of the nature of gender bias in peer recognition.\n",

This process\ncalled blended math-science sensemaking (blended MSS) is a desired skill for\nall STEM students, but few students are learning it, and there is little\nresearch on how to teach it. In this work we introduce the development and\ntesting of a novel instructional method for teaching blended (MSS) that is\nsuitable for use in STEM courses in undergraduate and K-12 educational\nsettings. This study builds on our past work on developing and validating a\nframework for characterizing in detail the cognitive levels involved in such\nsensemaking. This work uses the unique power of interactive simulations for\nassessing and developing blended MSS. We designed instructional activities to\nhelp students use blended MSS in the contexts of heat capacity and Coulombs\nlaw. The Heat Capacity activity was piloted in a freshmen Chemistry course and\nthe Coulombs law activity was piloted in a freshmen Physics course. The results\nindicate that for students who came in with no knowledge of the relevant\nequation the activity supported the development of both the equation, and their\nunderstanding of the mathematical relationships of the equation. These results\nindicate that the teaching approach helps students engage in blended MSS at\nhigher levels of cognitive complexity.\n",

However, AI is characteristically\nintegrated in this assessment by instructing the learners to employ ChatGPT as\none of the primary sources. The learners are directed to report the use of\nChatGPT by including both the prompts and its responses, before expressing\ntheir thoughts on AI-generated answers and their own concluding statement.\nThese three characteristic components of the present techniques -- the handling\nof ChatGPT through the prompts, comments on the AI-responses and the concluding\nthoughts -- are evaluated to gauge the learning.\n  The proposed assessment was assigned as a take-home group activity for a\nbatch of seventy eight students, divided into thirteen groups. Despite\naddressing the same questions, there was no significant overlap in the answers.\nMoreover, a wide range of approaches were adopted by the groups in handling\nChatGPT, which in-turn rendered different responses, ultimately drawing\ndistinct answers. Besides preventing the undesired use of ChatGPT by explicitly\nintegrating it, the proposed assessment seemingly helped the learners question\nthe accuracy of its responses.

In this paper, we examine whether that is the case for one type of\nforced-choice question, the complex multiple-choice (CMC) question. In a CMC\nquestion, students must select an answer choice that includes all correct\nresponses and no incorrect responses from a list. To conduct our study, we used\nfour years of data from Problem Roulette, an online program at our university\nthat allows students to prepare for exams with actual questions from previous\nyears' exams in a not-for-credit format. We categorized the 951 Physics II\n(Electricity and Magnetism) questions in the database as CMC or non-CMC. We\nfound that students performed 8.0 percentage points worse on CMC questions than\nthey did on non-CMC questions. In addition, we found differential impacts for\nlow income students and domestic students relative to medium and high income\nstudents and international students. Regression models supported these\ndescriptive findings. The results suggest that complex multiple-choice\nquestions may be contributing to the equity gaps observed on physics exams.\nConsidering, however, that CMC questions are more difficult for everyone,\nfuture research should examine the source of this difficulty and whether that\nsource is functionally related to learning and assessment.

        "summary": "  Measurement uncertainty is an important topic in the undergraduate laboratory\ncurriculum. Previous research on student thinking about experimental\nmeasurement uncertainty has focused primarily on introductory-level students'\nprocedural reasoning about data collection and interpretation. In this paper,\nwe extended this prior work to study upper-level students' thinking about\nsources of measurement uncertainty across experimental contexts, with a\nparticular focus on classical and quantum mechanics contexts. We developed a\nsurvey to probe students' thinking in the generic question \"What comes to mind\nwhen you think about measurement uncertainty in [classical/quantum] mechanics?\"\nas well as in a range of specific experimental scenarios and interpreted\nstudent responses through the lens of availability and accessibility of\nknowledge pieces. We found that limitations of the experimental setup were most\naccessible to students in classical mechanics while principles of the\nunderlying physics theory were most accessible to students in quantum\nmechanics, even in a context in which this theory was not relevant. We\nrecommend that future research probe which sources of uncertainty experts\nbelieve are relevant in which contexts and how instruction in both classical\nand quantum contexts can help students draw on appropriate sources of\nuncertainty in classical and quantum experiments.\n",

In this work we aimed to compare intro and\nbeyond-intro students' ideas about uncertainty. We administered a survey to\nstudents at 10 different universities with questions probing procedural\nreasoning about measurement, student-identified sources of uncertainty, and\npredictive reasoning about data distributions. We found that intro and\nbeyond-intro students answered similarly on questions where intro students\nalready exhibited expert-level reasoning, such as in comparing two data sets\nwith the same mean but different spreads, identifying limitations in an\nexperimental setup, and predicting how a data distribution would change if more\ndata were collected. For other questions, beyond-intro students generally\nexhibited more expert-like reasoning than intro students, such as when\ndetermining whether two sets of data agree, identifying principles of\nmeasurement that contribute to spread, and predicting how a data distribution\nwould change if better data were collected. Neither differences in student\npopulations, lab courses taken, nor research experience were able to fully\nexplain the variability between intro and beyond-intro student responses. These\nresults call for further research to better understand how students' ideas\nabout uncertainty develop beyond the intro level.\n",

Often\nstudents develop preferences and dislikes, but it's unclear when this\npreference solidifies during their undergraduate experiences. To get a better\nunderstanding, we interviewed eighteen physics majors who were at different\nstages of their degree regarding their interest in theory, computation, and\nexperimental methods. Out of the eighteen students, we chose to analyze only\nnine students who rated computation and theory the lowest. Our analysis did not\ninclude interest in experiment because the ratings were less negative. We used\nSocial Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Lucidchart to analyze students'\nresponses and create individual graphical representations of the influences for\neach student. Through this, we uncovered how various factors such as learning\nexperiences, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations influenced their low\ninterest in a particular method. We found that lack of knowledge and experience\nis often the main reason why self-efficacy was lower. Students' lack of\ninterest is also influenced by negative outcome expectations (e.g,\nmath-intensive and a bad work-life balance) more than other SCCT factors. Our\nfindings could help physics departments and educators identify positive and\nnegative factors that could lead to a more motivating and inclusive physics\ncurriculum.\n",

These exams,\nspanning both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, include traditional\npre-COVID and adaptive COVID-era formats. Questions from the years 2018-2020\nwere designed for pre-COVID in person adjudicated examinations whereas the\n2021-2022 exams were set for varying COVID-adapted conditions including\nopen-book conditions. To ensure a fair evaluation of AI performances, the exams\ncompleted by AI were assessed by the original exam markers. However, due to\nstaffing constraints, only the aforementioned 593 out of the total 1280\nquestions were marked. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 scored an average of 49.4\\% and\n38.6\\%, respectively, suggesting only the weaker students would potential\nimprove their marks if using AI. For exams from the pre-COVID era, the average\nscores for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 were 50.8\\% and 41.6\\%, respectively. However,\npost-COVID, these dropped to 47.5\\% and 33.6\\%.

        "summary": "  Historically, physics has been a predominantly male field, with previous\nliterature showing there is little diversity amongst U.S. physics students at\nthe undergraduate and graduate levels. Recent research indicates that the lack\nof underrepresented minorities in physics is partially due to an unwelcoming\nclimate within physics departments, as well as differential experiences during\ncollege. Most physics education research that addresses the lack of\nunderrepresented identities within the field has focused on the identities of\nwomen and people of color. There has been little research to investigate people\nwith multiple underrepresented identities, including those such as\nsocioeconomic status, first-generation college students, or learning\ndisabilities. Furthermore, there has been even less research conducted to\nbetter understand the impacts of the intersection of these underrepresented\nidentities and how it relates to experiences when pursuing a physics major. To\naddress this gap in the literature, our research has investigated undergraduate\nphysics students' experiences, to better understand what factors affect their\nexperiences and how these may differ by the intersection of one's\nunderrepresented identities. To achieve this goal, we conducted a series of\nin-depth interviews with physics majors at one university to learn more about\ntheir college experiences regarding physics. Our findings suggest that there is\na disproportionate number of obstacles when pursuing a physics major faced by\nthose with a greater number of underrepresented identities. We conclude that\nthere is a need for more equitable pedagogical practices and departmental\npolicies within the undergraduate physics experience, in addition to, a more\n\"human\" approach to mentorship, in order to foster an environment in which\nstudents with underrepresented identities can feel supported and thrive\nacademically and professionally.\n",

In this study we investigate whether the framework can\ncharacterize engagement in MSS among undergraduate students from diverse\nbackgrounds and identify potential differences between the two populations. The\nframework is effective in characterizing engagement in MSS by undergraduate\nstudents from diverse backgrounds and largely functions as a learning\nprogression. We have also uncovered a distinct pattern of engagement in MSS\nreflected in students successfully developing the mathematical relationship\ndescribing their observations without engaging in a type of MSS focused on\nquantitative pattern identification. Unlike students from dominant backgrounds,\ndiverse students leverage lower level MSS to develop the formula for the\nphenomenon. Further, diverse students use PhET simulations to make sense of the\nphenomenon more and are more successful in using the simulations to find the\ncorrect mathematical relationship compared to students from dominant\nbackgrounds. Math preparation has a stronger effect at level 1 compared to\nlevels 2 and 3 of the framework. The framework can guide the development of\ninstructional and assessment strategies to support students from diverse\nbackgrounds in building MSS skills.

        "summary": "  Joining a research group is one of the most important events on a graduate\nstudent's path to earning a PhD, but the ways students go about searching for a\ngroup remain largely unstudied. It is therefore crucial to investigate whether\ndepartments are equitably supporting students as they look for an advisor,\nespecially as students today enter graduate school with more diverse\nbackgrounds than ever before. To better understand the phenomenon of finding a\nresearch group, we use a comparative case study approach to contrast important\naspects of two physics PhD students' experiences. Semi-structured interviews\nwith the students chronicled their interactions with departments, faculty, and\nthe graduate student community, and described the resources they found most and\nleast helpful. Our results reveal significant disparities in students'\nperceptions of how to find an advisor, as well as inequities in resources that\nnegatively influenced one student's search. We also uncover substantial\nvariation regarding when in their academic careers the students began searching\nfor a graduate advisor, indicating the importance of providing students with\nconsistent advising throughout their undergraduate and graduate experiences.\n",

However, we have taken the advantage of modern\nadvanced technology of smartphone camera to find the load depression graph of\nthe cantilever by taking photographs with the smartphone camera. Smartphone\nphotography allows us to find a precise transverse magnification of an object\nfrom the size of the real image formed on the sensor of the camera. Image size\non the sensor can be obtained with micron level accuracy. From the load\ndepression graph, we have determined the Young modulus of the bar. The\nsensitive measurements of the depression of the cantilever at its free end by\nits own weight, have allowed us to determine the density of aluminium. We have\nadded an analysis of the chi squred minimisation technique for determining the\nparameters and their uncertainities in a linear fit. Starting from the\ncurvature matrix we have made a comprehensive analysis of the error matrix\nrelevant for a two parameter linear fit. Then we have shown how to form the\nerror matrix for the fitted parameters which includes the covariance term\nbetween the two correlated parameters, in the context of our specific\nexperiment.

Without a comprehensive\nunderstanding of gendered disparities in high school course selection, it will\nbe impossible to close completely the gender gap in many STEM disciplines. This\nstudy examines eleven years of detailed administrative data to determine\ngendered enrolment trends in university-stream secondary school STEM courses.\nMale and female enrolments for all publicly funded secondary schools across the\nprovince of Ontario (N = 844) were tracked from the 2007/08 academic year to\n2017/18. The data reveal a clear trend of growing enrolment in STEM\ndisciplines, with the increase in female students continuing their STEM\neducation significantly outpacing males in almost all courses. However, these\nresults also demonstrate the disparities that persist across STEM disciplines.\nThe existing gender gap in physics remains large - in 2018, the median grade 12\nphysics class was only $36.5\\pm0.05%$ female - with virtually no progress\nhaving been made to close this gap. By tracking individual student cohorts, we\nalso demonstrate a newly discovered result showing the continuation rate of\nmale students in biology stream courses has experienced a precipitous drop-off.\nThe proportion of male students continuing from grade 10 science to grade 12\nbiology two years later has seen an average yearly decline of $-0.44\\pm0.08$\npercentage points, potentially foreshadowing the emergence of another\nsignificant gender gap in STEM. We suggest that researchers and educators cease\ntreating STEM as a monolith when addressing gender disparities, as doing so\nobscures significant differences between disciplines. Future efforts,\nparticularly those aimed to support women in STEM, must instead adopt a more\ntargeted approach to ensure that they solve existing problems without creating\nnew ones.\n",

It focuses on the role of\nsurface features that YouTube provides (e.g., likes, views, thumbnails) and the\ncomments underneath the videos in the decision-making process using videos on\nquantum physics topics as an example. The study consists of two phases: In\nphase 1, N = 24 (pre-service) physics teachers were randomly assigned to one of\nthree groups, each covering a different quantum topic (entanglement, quantum\ntunnelling or quantum computing, respectively). From eight options provided,\nthey selected a suitable video for teaching while their eye movements were\ntracked, and think-aloud data was collected. Phase 2 allowed participants to\nfreely choose one YouTube video on a second quantum topic while thinking aloud.\nThe results reveal a significant emphasis on video thumbnails during selection,\nwith over one-third of the fixation time directed towards them. Think-aloud\ndata confirms the importance of thumbnails in decision-making. A detailed\nanalysis identifies that participants did not rely on (content-related)\ncomments despite they have found to be significantly correlated with the\nvideos' explaining quality. Instead, decisions were influenced by surface\nfeatures and pragmatic factors such as channel familiarity. Retrospective\nreflections through a questionnaire support these observations. Building on the\nexisting empirical evidence, a decision tree is proposed to help teachers\nidentify high-quality videos considering duration, likes, comments, and\ninteractions. The decision tree can serve as a hypothesis for future research\nand needs to be evaluated in terms of how it can help systematize the process\nof selecting high-quality YouTube videos for science teaching.\n",

In order to better integrate computational thinking in\nintroductory physics, we need to understand what physicists find important\nabout computational thinking in introductory physics. We present a qualitative\nanalysis of twenty-six interviews asking academic (N=18) and industrial (N=8)\nphysicists about the teaching and learning of computational thinking in\nintroductory physics courses. These interviews are part of a longer-term\nproject towards developing an assessment protocol for computational thinking in\nintroductory physics. We find that academic and industrial physicists value\nstudents' ability to read code and that Python (or VPython) and spreadsheets\nwere the preferred computational language or environment used. Additionally,\nthe interviewees mentioned that identifying the core physics concepts within a\nprogram, explaining code to others, and good program hygiene (i.e., commenting\nand using meaningful variable names) are important skills for introductory\nstudents to acquire. We also find that while a handful of interviewees note\nthat the experience and skills gained from computation are quite useful for\nstudent's future careers, they also describe multiple limiting factors of\nteaching computation in introductory physics, such as curricular overhaul, not\nhaving \"space\" for computation, and student rejection. The interviews show that\nwhile adding computational thinking to physics students repertoire is\nimportant, the importance really comes from using computational thinking to\nlearn and understand physics better. This informs us that the assessment we\ndevelop should only include the basics of computational thinking needed to\nassess introductory physics knowledge.\n",

        "summary": "  In Radiation Physics classes, point sources are typically used, for which it\nis relatively easy to describe the signal obtained by a radiation detector,\nsuch as the NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. The use of large extended radiation\nsources is generally avoided due to the mathematical complexity that their\ndescription may involve. However, the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods\nallows this limitation to be overcome. Potassium chloride, containing the 40K\nisotope, is an ideal candidate for carrying out this type of experiment. The\nsource activity is obtained through the detection of the 1460.8 keV\ngamma-photon emitted in the 40K decay. In the first experiment, a cylindrical\ncontainer is used, placing the NaI(Tl) detector in its center and filling the\nremaining space with potassium chloride. In a second, more complex case, a\nlarge radioactive source consisting of a container filled with a mixture of\nsand and potassium chloride, with the NaI(Tl) detector placed in the center of\nthe mixture, is used. In this case, the mass of potassium chloride is\napproximately 1/5 of the sand mass. In both experiments, the detection\nefficiency is obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. A careful analysis of the\nexperimental data allows to obtain a good agreement between the measured and\ncalculated value of the activity.\n",

Neuroqueer physicists, therefore, have unique non-normative ways of\ndoing physics, the study of the rules (which is done societally) which govern\nthe natural world. It is imperative that, when teaching neurodivergent\nstudents, we encourage and support this non-normative way of thinking about\nphysics, and help them do physics in ways that they will be successful, and\nsupport the development of Neuroqueer (Scientific) Literacies, from Kleekamp's\nand Smilges's works on literacy.

This\nstudy delves into the capabilities of AI in Physics Education and offers\nactionable AI policy recommendations. Using a Large Language Model (LLM), we\nassessed its ability to answer 1337 Physics exam questions spanning GCSE,\nA-Level, and Introductory University curricula. We employed various AI\nprompting techniques: Zero Shot, In Context Learning, and Confirmatory\nChecking, which merges Chain of Thought reasoning with Reflection. The AI's\nproficiency varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on\nGCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an\noverall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique. In a\nseparate test, the LLM's accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to\ndecrease as the number of digits increased. Furthermore, when evaluated as a\nmarking tool, the LLM's concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with\nnotable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like\nmultiple-choice. Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution:\nwhile current LLMs can consistently perform well on Physics questions at\nearlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and\ncomplex calculations. LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the\nsyllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic. This\nsuggests that at university, there's no substantial threat from LLMs for\nnon-invigilated Physics questions. However, given the LLMs' considerable\nproficiency in writing Physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated\nexaminations of these skills in Physics are highly vulnerable to automated\ncompletion by LLMs. This vulnerability also extends to Physics questions\npitched at lower academic levels.\n",

Prior work suggests that\ncovariational reasoning in physics contexts differs in important ways from\nreasoning about functions and graphs in purely mathematical contexts; this\nreasoning is effortful in physics even for mathematically well-prepared\nstudents. In order to help students learn to reason covariationally in physics\ncontexts, we need to characterize what we mean by physics covariational\nreasoning. To this end, we present a framework of covariational reasoning in\nphysics contexts, to describe the ways that covariational reasoning is used in\nphysics modeling. The framework can be used as a tool by which instructors can\nrecognize physics covariational reasoning patterns and researchers can analyze\nstudent reasoning. The framework can also help inform the development of\neffective instructional materials and methods.\n",

Helping\npre-college students learn these key concepts in QIS is an effective approach\nto introducing them to the Second Quantum Revolution and inspiring them to\nbecome future contributors in the growing field of quantum information science\nand technology as leaders in areas related to quantum computing, communication\nand sensing.

We create opportunities for students to practice physics as a\nmeans of creating and validating new knowledge by simulating real and\nfictitious physics in virtual reality (VR). This approach seeks to steer\nstudents away from a confirmation mindset in labs by eliminating any form of\nprior or outside models to confirm. We refer to the activities using this\napproach as Novel Observations in Mixed Reality (NOMR) labs. We examined NOMR's\neffects in 100-level and 200-level undergraduate courses. Using pre-post\nmeasurements we find that after NOMR labs, students in both populations were\nmore expertlike in their epistemology about experimental physics and held\nstronger self-efficacy about their abilities to do the kinds of things\nexperimental physicists do. Through the lens of the psychological theory of\nflow, we found that students engage as productively with NOMR labs as with\ntraditional hands-on labs. This engagement persisted after the novelty of VR in\nthe classroom wore off, suggesting that these effects are due to the\npedagogical design rather than the medium of the intervention. We conclude that\nthese NOMR labs offer an approach to physics laboratory instruction that\ncenters the development of students' understanding of and comfort with the\nauthentic practice of science.\n",

In this study, we\nprobe both the peers with whom students interact about their physics course and\nthe particular aspects of the course material about which they interacted in\nsix different introductory physics courses: four lecture courses and two lab\ncourses. Drawing on methods in social network analysis, we replicate prior work\ndemonstrating that, on average, students who interact with more peers in their\nphysics courses have higher final course grades. Expanding on this result, we\nfind that students discuss a wide range of aspects of course material with\ntheir peers: concepts, small-group work, assessments, lecture, and homework. We\nobserve that in the lecture courses, interacting with peers about concepts is\nmost strongly correlated with final course grade, with smaller correlations\nalso arising for small-group work and homework. In the lab courses, on the\nother hand, small-group work is the only interaction topic that significantly\ncorrelates with final course grade.

Yet, prior work has found a\ngender bias in peer recognition, in which student nominations of strong peers\ndisproportionately favor men over women, in some instructional contexts.\nResearchers have hypothesized that such a gender bias diminishes over time, as\ndetermined by students' academic year: studies have found a gender bias in\nscience courses aimed at first-year students, but not in science courses aimed\nat beyond first-year students. This hypothesis that patterns of peer\nrecognition change over time, however, has yet to be tested with longitudinal\ndata--previous studies only examine snapshots of different students in\ndifferent science courses. In this study, we isolate the effect of time on peer\nrecognition by analyzing student nominations of strong peers across a\ntwo-semester introductory physics course sequence, containing the same set of\nstudents and the same instructor in both semesters, at a mostly-women\ninstitution. Using a combination of social network analysis and qualitative\nmethods, we find that while many students receive similar levels of peer\nrecognition over time, the four most highly nominated students--the recognition\ncelebrities--exhibit some change between semesters even in this highly\ncontrolled setting. Furthermore, we observe that these changes in the\ncelebrities track closely with changes in student outspokenness and that being\noutspoken is likely more important for gaining recognition than earning a high\ngrade in the class. These findings lend support to prior work's hypothesis that\npeer recognition changes over time, but also challenge the generalizability of\nprevious results (i.e., that patterns of recognition are related to students'\nacademic year).\n",

Understanding these\nperspectives is crucial for evaluating whether departments are providing\nstudents with adequate support while they search for a research group, and how\ndifficulties during this process contribute to attrition. Semi-structured\ninterviews with N=20 first and second year physics PhD students reveal that\nincoming graduate students see joining a research group as a significant\ndecision, and recognize that it may impact whether they will be able to\ncomplete the program. We found that students who struggled to find a group felt\nisolated and worried about falling behind their peers, whereas students who\nwere able to immerse themselves in a positive group environment reported\nincreased sense of belonging in their programs. The process of finding a\nresearch group often held differential importance for students identifying as\nwomen and non-binary, who at times reported having to deprioritize their\npreferred research topic in order to be part of a more inclusive working\nenvironment.

Four of\nthe responses paired with human-written feedback were included in the prompt as\nexamples for GPT. We tasked GPT to generate feedback to the other 16 responses,\nand we refined the prompt after several iterations. In stage two, we gave four\nstudent researchers the 16 responses as well as two versions of feedback, one\nwritten by the authors and the other by GPT. Students were asked to rate the\ncorrectness and usefulness of each feedback, and to indicate which one was\ngenerated by GPT. The results showed that students tended to rate the feedback\nby human and GPT equally on correctness, but they all rated the feedback by GPT\nas more useful. Additionally, the successful rates of identifying GPT's\nfeedback were low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.6. In stage three, we tasked GPT to\ngenerate feedback to the rest of the student responses (n=65).

All the instructors rated approximately\n70% of the feedback statements needing only minor or no modification. This\nstudy demonstrated the feasibility of using Generative AI as an assistant to\ngenerating feedback for student written responses with only a relatively small\nnumber of examples. An AI assistance can be one of the solutions to\nsubstantially reduce time spent on grading student written responses.\n",

By and large, siloed higher-education STEM curricula provide\ninadequate opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to critically\nanalyze the historical and epistemological foundations of scientific knowledge\nproduction and even fewer tools to engage with and respond to modern\ncommunity-based cases. Here, we describe the development of a humanities- and\nsocial sciences-informed curriculum designed to address the theory, content,\nand skill-based needs of traditional STEM students considering technoscientific\ncareers. In essence, this course is designed to foster behavior change,\nde-center dominant ways of knowing in the sciences, and bolster self-reflection\nand critical-thinking skills to equip the developing STEM workforce with a more\nnuanced and accurate understanding of the social, political, and economic role\nof science and technology. This curriculum has the potential to empower\nSTEM-educated professionals to contribute to a more promising, inclusive\nfuture.

Specifically, we seek to study those cognitive processes and information\navailable to students when they face science problems and, therefore, to\nexplore the various heuristic processes that students use when solving physics\nproblems. Our results indicated four intuitive heuristics in students' minds\nwhen they solve problems in Mechanics and especially in the unit projectile\nmotion: associative activation, processing fluency, attribute substitution and\nanchoring effect. These heuristics prevent students from applying knowledge and\nmethods that they already possess to solve a physics problem.\n",

So far, much of the physics education research relating\nto AI has focused on lecture-based assessment and the ability of ChatGPT to\nanswer conceptual surveys and traditional exam-style questions. In this study,\nwe shift the focus by investigating ChatGPT's ability to complete an\nintroductory mechanics laboratory activity by using Code Interpreter, a recent\nplugin that allows users to generate and analyse data by writing and running\nPython code `behind the scenes'. By uploading a common `spring constant' lab\nactivity using Code Interpreter, we investigate the ability of ChatGPT to\ninterpret the activity, generate realistic model data, produce a line-fit, and\ncalculate the reduced chi square statistic. By analysing our interactions with\nChatGPT, along with the Python code generated by Code Interpreter, we assess\nhow the quality and accuracy of ChatGPT's responses depends on different levels\nof prompt detail. We find that although ChatGPT is capable of completing the\nlab activity and generating plausible-looking data, the quality of the output\nis highly dependent on the detail and specificity of the text prompts provided.\nWe find that the data generation process adopted by ChatGPT in this study leads\nto heteroscedasticity in the simulated data, which may be difficult for novice\nlearners to spot. We also find that when real experimental data is uploaded via\nCode Interpreter, ChatGPT is capable of correctly plotting and fitting the\ndata, calculating the spring constant and associated uncertainty, and\ncalculating the reduced chi square statistic.

We\nalso observed that pre-service teachers tend to describe the activation of\nmaterials due to ionizing radiation despite having previously denied an\nactivation, thus showing that the conception of activation of materials can\nreemerge in particular framings. Within the interviews conducted, the concept\nof energy emerged as a central coordination class regarding radioactivity. This\ncoordination class appeared across contexts and proved fruitful in explaining\npre-service teachers' conceptions about radioactivity. We will use the results\nfrom this study to develop a teaching-learning laboratory for pre-service\nteachers in which they can actively study high school students' conceptions\nwhile reflecting on their own. In this way, these findings will contribute to\nimproving the structure of nuclear physics courses at the university.\n",

The control group (Physics 2 2022B) used traditional teaching methods,\nwhile the experimental group (Physics 2 2023A) integrated ChatGPT as a learning\ntool. Our results indicate that the use of ChatGPT led to a significant\ndecrease in student performance, as evidenced by lower grades and negative Hake\nfactors compared to the control group. In addition, a survey of students\nrevealed conflicting perceptions of the usefulness of ChatGPT in teaching\nphysics. While most recognized its usefulness in understanding concepts and\nproviding information, concerns were raised about its potential to reduce\ncritical thinking and independent learning. These findings suggest that while\nChatGPT can be a useful tool, it should be used with caution and as a\nsupplement to traditional teaching methods, rather than as a stand-alone\nsolution. The study underlines the importance of critical and reflective use of\nAI tools in educational settings and highlights the irreplaceable role of\nteachers in providing comprehensive educational support.\n",

Using think-aloud interviews with students in small\ngroups, we ask them to solve together on a large whiteboard conceptual problems\nfrom this E&M context. The interviews were video and audio recorded, and\nqualitatively analyzed using an emergent coding method and the resources\nframework. Through this analysis, we observed one common mechanism in all three\ngroup-interviews whereby students collaborated effectively: first one student\nactivated a conceptual resource and expressed it, then another student took up\nthat idea, and finally the whole group together used that idea to move forward\nwith the problem. This mechanism exemplifies a newer framework: shared\nresources. We further analyzed students' collaboration through the lens of\nshared resources and identified multiple instances.

In order to raise this description to a mathematically sound level\nof understanding, we present an educational approach based on the visual\ninterpretation of the vector differential operators, i.e. divergence and curl.\nAs a starting point, we use simple vector field diagrams for a qualitative\napproach to connect both sides of the integral theorems, and present an\ninteractive graphical tool to support this connection.

This version of the survey instrument is a longer version of the\noriginal shorter version developed and validated earlier. The 19 contexts\nincluding the exact wording of all of the problem situations posed in the two\nversions of the survey instrument are identical and the difference between the\nlong and short versions of the instrument is only in the multiple-choice\noptions. In particular, in the longer version of the survey instrument, there\nare no alternative conceptions explicitly embedded in the four multiple-choice\noptions students choose from and the questions asked in a given context in one\nitem of the shorter survey instrument were split into several items focusing,\ne.g., on different thermodynamic variables. After the development and\nvalidation of the longer version of the survey instrument, the final version\nwas administered in 12 different in-person classes (four different\ninstitutions) in which students answered the questions in-class on paper\nscantron forms with the instructor as the proctor and 12 different in-person\nclasses (five different institutions) in which students answered the questions\nonline on Qualtrics within a two-hour period. This longer version of the survey\ninstrument was administered to introductory physics students in various\ntraditionally taught calculus-based and algebra-based classes before and after\ntraditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts.

A basic course includes the\ndescription of the magnetic interaction along with empirical results such as\nthe Biot-Savart law's. However, evaluating the magnetic field due to certain\ncurrent carrying system at any point in space is not an easy task, especially\nfor points in space where symmetry arguments cannot be applied. In this paper\nwe study the magnetic field produced by both Helmholtz and Maxwell coils at all\npoints in space by using a hybrid methodology that combines the superposition\nprinciple and an analytical result. We implement a computational approach, that\nis based on iterating $n$ times the magnetic field produced by a finite\ncurrent-carrying wire, to evaluate the magnetic field at any point in space for\ncoils arrangements without using advanced calculus. This methodology helps\nteachers and students to explore the field due to systems with different levels\nof complexity, combining analytical and computational skills to visualize and\nanalyse the magnetic field. After our analysis, we show that this is an useful\napproach to emphasize fundamental concepts and mitigate some of the issues that\narise when evaluating the magnetic field for systems proposed in introductory\nphysics textbooks.\n",

        "summary": "  Vector fields are a highly abstract physical concept that is often taught\nusing visualizations. Although vector representations are particularly suitable\nfor visualizing quantitative data, they are often confusing, especially when\ndescribing real fields such as magnetic and electric fields, as the vector\narrows can overlap. The present study examines vector understanding at the end\nof secondary education. In particular, the extent to which the geometry of the\nfield can be derived from conventional unit vector representations and\nrepresentations with centered unit vectors is examined. To support this\nunderstanding, two exercises were compared. The unirepresentational exercise\nargued within the conventional unit vector representation, while the\nmultirepresentational exercise attempted to support the link between centered\nand conventional unit vectors. The results show that almost all test subjects\nsolved the items for generating vector representations correctly, but\nsignificant difficulties were encountered in interpreting vector\nrepresentations. Drawing and interpreting vector representations therefore\nappear to be different skills that should be practiced intensively and in an\nintegrated way. Furthermore, the learners recognized the field's geometry much\nmore readily from centered unit vectors than from conventional unit vectors.\nErrors occur especially when interpreting the geometry of conventional unit\nvector representations of rotational fields and fields containing both sources\nand sinks, while the geometries of fields containing only sinks were\ninterpreted quite well. The comparison between the two exercises showed that a\npromising approach to deepen students' understanding would be to use an\nexercise that contrasts the two representations and explains how to translate\nfrom one representation to the other, rather than describing the main elements\nof only a single representation.\n",

As many institutions and instructors seek\nto evolve or transform physics lab learning, it is important that changes are\nmade that improve equity for all students along multiple axes of identity,\nincluding gender. The studies highlighted in this review article describe the\nexistence of complex gender-based differences, e.g., in opportunities to tinker\nwith lab equipment, as well as differences in grades, conceptual understanding,\nand motivational outcomes across a broad range of lab curricula and contexts.\nThe studies also illustrate and explore social interactions and structures that\ncan impact students' experiences based on their gender identities. Although\nthere has been less scholarship focused on proposals to reduce gender-based\ninequities in labs, this review article also provides an overview of some\nrelevant proposals as well as associated research results. This overview of\nresearch on gender equity in physics labs helps to make clear that future\nscholarship on equity in physics labs should adopt gender frameworks that allow\nresearchers to transcend binary gender identities and student deficit framing\nof research results. Likewise, a case is made that future research is needed on\nequity along other axes of identity, as well as research that accounts for\nintersectionality of different identities, in the physics lab context.\n",

The flexibility,\nlow cost, and power of these devices provides an attractive way for students to\nlearn to use and master research-grade instrumentation. Therefore, we\nintroduced new technology, including Arduino Due microcontroller boards, to a\nsecond-year honors physics lab in order to provide improved learning\nexperiences for students. This transformation was implemented in three lab\nmodules and focused on diminishing the black box nature of the traditional labs\nwhile encouraging students to engage in troubleshooting. The importance of\ntroubleshooting was made evident to students by the instructor emphasizing it\nas an inevitable and central part of experimentation. This lab transformation\nalso required that students perform work that was `above and beyond' the scope\nof the assigned experimental work for part of the course credit. While the\ntechnological aspects of the transformation were received well by a majority of\nstudents, our observations during the initial implementation suggested a need\nfor some modifications to instructional practices in order to improve the\nlearning and experiences for all students. In particular, we find that many\nstudents can benefit from additional scaffolding in order to complete `above\nand beyond' work. Similarly, we find that students in general, and\nunderrepresented students such as women in particular, may need thoughtful\nintervention from the instructor, e.g., in order to avoid becoming isolated\nwhen the lab work is designed for pair work. Otherwise, some students may be\nleft to work alone with a disproportionate work-load if students choose their\nown partners.\n",

Former works have often\nrecorded the notion of gendered mean FCI scores favoring male students notably\nin the North America (NA) based studies. Nevertheless, these performance gaps\nremain inconclusive and unexplored outside the NA context. This paper aims to\nfill this gap by meta-analyzing the mean FCI scores between gender based on the\nexisting PER literature beyond the NA context. We analyzed the magnitude and\ndirection on the mean FCI scores between gender on the basis of primary\ninternational studies published over the last two decades. We also explored the\nmoderating impact of international study characteristics on the meta-analytic\nfindings by performing a subgroup analysis to study the different study regions\nstratified by two subgroups (NA vs non-NA authors). Thirty-eight studies\nreporting the mean FCI scores by gender were included in the present\nmeta-analysis. We employed Hedges' g statistic to estimate to what degree the\nmean FCI scores may be different between male and female students on each\nstudy. Under a random effects model, we meta-analyzed the findings and\nconducted a subgroup analysis to answer the research questions. In summary, our\nmeta-analysis indicated a significantly positive and moderate amount of\ngendered mean FCI scores in favor of male students both in NA- and non-NA based\nregions, and the performance gaps were wider in the NA-based studies.\nSuggestions are discussed for promoting gender fairness in the FCI when\ninterpreting its scores for teaching, learning, and forthcoming studies.\n",

The initial findings provide insights into the\npedagogical benefits and logistical considerations of using such technologies\nin a laboratory setting. Although no direct comparison with traditional\nteaching methods has been made, the observed student engagement and feedback\nsuggest a positive impact on learning outcomes, even within the constraints of\nthe short duration of the interventions.\n",

The research questions are: 1) What are\ntypical strata representation rates and outcomes on physics research-based\nassessments? 2) To what extent do MAIHDA models create more accurate predicted\nstrata outcomes than fixed effects models? 3) To what extent do MAIHDA models\nallow the modeling of smaller strata sample sizes? We simulated 3,000 datasets\nbased on real-world data from 5,955 students on the LASSO platform. We found\nthat MAIHDA created more accurate and precise predictions than fixed effect\nmodels. We also found that using MAIHDA could allow researchers to disaggregate\ntheir data further, creating smaller group sample sizes while maintaining more\naccurate findings than fixed effect models.

This study explores the impact identity sharing has\non obtaining contextual information that motivates empathetic action. Nineteen\nsemi structured interviews with physics faculty explored participant identities\nand interactions across various contexts. Employing emergent thematic coding,\nwe crafted four personas around faculty sharing, teaching values, and student\nreciprocity. Brooke, the Trust Builder, prioritizes creating an environment of\ntrust by openly discussing their identity, aiming to foster student openness.\nNour, the Identity Navigator, shares personal experiences to assist others in\nnavigating their own identities, acknowledging the challenges of college years.\nBrooke and Nour had more students approaching them with personal issues,\nindicating a correlation between faculty identity sharing and student openness.\nCasey, the Cautious Sharer, expresses concerns about potential alienation or\nbacklash, approaching personal sharing with caution. Wray, adopting a Walled\nOff approach, separates personal and professional life due to past negative\nexperiences or a belief in the importance of that division. Among the faculty\ninterviewed, 15 who were explicitly open about their identities reported that\nstudents approached them with personal issues.

This examination occurred almost every week during the first\nsemester, and for one cohort also in the second semester, yielding a total of\n3,241 PSQ data points and 5,823 stressors.

We found that the one-year persistence rates for the RPS course\nwere 74% (fall semester) and 90% (spring semester), while the lecture-based\nclass had a persistence rate of 64% and 78%, respectively. In spring, the RPS\npersistence rate was significantly higher (p=0.037). The RPS also had higher\nfinal grades and larger learning gains than the lecture-based class despite\nlower scores on a physics diagnostic test. We also note that the higher rates\nof persistence were not completely explained by higher final grades. This study\nmotivates future work to understand the structural mechanisms that promote\nstudent persistence in introductory physics courses.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper describes an algorithmic system called SQT for the computer\nsimulation of a wide class of quantum experiments on entangled particles. SQT\nmaintains a hidden internal state for each particle and it provides an\ninitialization process and measurement processes with visual outputs and a\nmeans of connecting these in software to make the simulator for a given\nexperiment in Quantum Mechanics. The statistical behavior of the Quantum\nMechanical system is replicated by incorporating the probabilities that are\nobserved in real world quantum experiments. SQT is thus a tool to provide\neducational understanding of quantum systems and this tool removes the mystery\nsurrounding entangled particles. It shows that only initial measurement\nprobabilities and conditional probabilities of transition from the previous\nstate and no earlier to the next state are sufficient inputs for the simulator\nto replicate all Quantum Mechanical experiments in the simulator and no other\ninputs such as complex numbers have to be entered into the simulator. The\nsimulator, unlike the real world quantum system, can display the hidden\nsub-quantum state after which it can be seen that there is no spooky\ninteraction between entangled particles at all. SQT therefore provides a new\ninterpretation of quantum phenomena that may well replace the Copenhagen\ninterpretation founded by Niels Bohr and it answers Einstein's final question\nregarding whether Quantum Mechanics can be considered a complete theory or not.\n",

The study was conducted across three\ninstitutions, involving non-physics students enrolled in algebra-based and\ncalculus-based physics courses. Our findings reveal no significant differences\nin participation levels across genders in various lab activities.

The instructional context for the study was a summer program hosted at a\nprivate research university in the eastern United States. The program was\ndesigned as a bridge program for matriculating students who were first\ngeneration and/or deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH). Accommodations such as\ninterpreters and technology were provided for DHH students. We analyzed 15\nstudents' discourse moves in five lab activities from the video recordings,\nresulting in a total of 40 student-lab units. We developed codes to describe\nstudent discourse moves: asking a question, proposing an idea, participating in\ndiscussion, chatting off-task, and talking to instructor. Through a cluster\nanalysis using those 40 student-lab units on our quantified discourse moves, we\nidentified four discourse styles, high on-task high social, high on-task low\nsocial, low on-task low social, and low on-task high social. The results show\nthat individual students tend to demonstrate varying discourse styles in\ndifferent lab activities; students' discourse styles within the same groups\ntend to be aligned with their group members. Moreover, no difference was\nobserved in discourse styles between genders, but DHH students were observed to\nparticipate significantly less in group discourse compared to their non-DHH\npeers.

LTs in\nastronomy are post-lecture activities developed with the intention of helping\nstudents engage with conceptual and reasoning difficulties around a specific\ntopic with the end goal of them developing a more expert-like understanding of\nastrophysical concepts. To date, all astronomy LTs have been developed for\nundergraduate courses taught in-person. Increases in online course enrollments\nand the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the need for additional\ninteractive, research-based, curricular materials designed for online\nclassrooms. To this end, we developed and assessed the efficacy of an\ninnovative, interactive LT designed to teach planet formation in asynchronous,\nonline, introductory astronomy courses for undergraduates. We utilized the\nPlanet Formation Concept Inventory to compare learning outcomes between courses\nthat implemented the new online, interactive LT, and those that used either a\nlecture-only approach or utilized a standard pencil-and-paper LT on the same\ntopic. Overall, learning gains from the standard pencil-and-paper LT were\nstatistically indistinguishable from the in-person implementation of the online\nLT and both of these conditions outperformed the lecture-only condition.\nHowever, when implemented asynchronously, learning gains from the online LT\nwere lower and not significantly above the lecture-only condition. While\nimprovements can be made to improve the online LT in the future, the current\ndiscipline ideas still outperform traditional lecture, and can be used as a\ntool to teach planet formation effectively.\n",

These misconceptions challenge educators,\nas students often resist information that conflicts with their preconceptions.\nThe first aim of this manuscript is to summarize the existing literature on\nmisconceptions in university physics, reviewing misconceptions' sources,\ndiagnoses, and remediation strategies. Most of this literature has concentrated\non classical physics. However, quantum physics poses unique challenges because\nits concepts are removed from everyday experiences. This signals the need to\nask how well existing strategies for addressing misconceptions apply to quantum\nphysics. This is underscored by the recent surge of people from diverse\nbackgrounds entering quantum physics because of the growing significance of\nquantum technologies. To help answer this question, we conducted in-depth\ninterviews with quantum physics instructors at the University of Waterloo who\nhave collectively taught over 100 quantum physics courses. These interviews\nexplored common misconceptions in quantum physics, their origins, and effective\ninstructional techniques to address them. We highlight specific misconceptions,\nsuch as misunderstanding of entanglement and spin, and successful teaching\nstrategies, including ``misconception-trap quizzes.'' We integrate insights\nfrom the literature review with our interview data to provide an overview of\ncurrent best practices in addressing physics misconceptions. Furthermore, we\nidentify key research questions that warrant further exploration, such as the\nefficacy of multi-tier tests in quantum physics and developing a cohesive\nquantum curriculum.

Our research presents some\nadvancements compared to previous educational studies by thoroughly examining\nquaternion applications in rotations. We differentiate between left and right\nrotations through detailed numerical examples and propose a general approach to\nrotations via a theorem, clearly defining the associated morphism.

The\nsurvey was administered in 10 different languages to over 2000 students from\ndiverse backgrounds, and it explored multiple facets of their perspectives on\nastronomy. The topics included students' views on the incorporation of\nastronomy in curricula, their grasp of fundamental astronomical concepts,\naccess to educational resources, cultural connections to astronomy, and their\nlevels of interest and aspirations in the subject. We find notable deficiencies\nin students' knowledge of basic astronomical principles, with only a minority\ndemonstrating proficiency in key areas such as celestial sizes, distances, and\nlunar phases. Furthermore, access to resources such as telescopes and\nplanetariums remain limited across the country. Despite these challenges, a\nsignificant majority of students expressed a keen interest in astronomy. We\nfurther analyze the data along socioeconomic and gender lines. Particularly\nstriking were the socioeconomic disparities, with students from resource-poor\nbackgrounds often having lower levels of access and proficiency. Some\ndifferences were observed between genders, although not very pronounced.

EPs are able to smooth the contrast of\nplaying games and learning, providing an additional bridge to overcome the fear\nof physics. A strong advantage is the flexibility of the European board\nconcept, choosing from a broad range of optional EPs to fascinate and motivate\nstudents taking into account individual preferences improving escape rooms by\ndecision-making skills.

To\naddress this, we surveyed undergraduate students in an introductory astronomy\nclass about their attitudes towards learning astronomy over the course of five\nsemesters. Overall, students felt an affinity for astronomy, felt moderately\ncompetent, perceived astronomy to be intermediate in terms of difficulty, and\nagreed strongly with standard statements reflecting a \"growth mindset,\" i.e.,\nthe belief that intelligence is malleable rather than fixed from birth. Their\nresponses were stable over the course of the semester and did not appear to\ndepend strongly on student demographics. The unexpected start of the COVID-19\npandemic and the associated shift to all-virtual learning correlated with a\ndrop in their affinity for astronomy, a small decrease in their perceived\ncompetence, and an increase in the perceived difficulty of the topic. Their\noverall learning mindset showed negligible change during this time, emphasizing\nthe stability of their belief in a growth mindset as compared to other measured\nlearning attitudes. However, more nuanced questions about their behaviors and\ninterpretations in the classroom, about how they felt \"in the moment\", and\nabout what factors were most important for their success in the class revealed\nsignificantly lower alignment with a growth mindset. This suggests that while\nintroductory astronomy students may believe that they have a growth mindset,\nthis mindset is not necessarily reflected in their self-reported classroom\nbehaviors or measured responses to actual learning challenges.\n",

In this research, we introduce SimPal, a\nLarge Language Model (LLM) based meta-conversational agent, to solve this\nmisalignment issue between a pre-trained conversational AI agent and the\nconstantly evolving pedagogy of instructors. Through natural conversation with\nSimPal, teachers first explain their desired IGs, based on which SimPal\nidentifies a set of relevant physical variables and their relationships to\ncreate symbolic representations of the desired IGs. The symbolic\nrepresentations can then be leveraged to design prompts for the original AI\nagent to yield better alignment with the desired IGs.

We find that a\nwidespread unproductive tendency for introductory students to associate the\nproperties of entropy with those of energy leads to many errors based on an\nidea of \"conservation of entropy,\" in which entropy increases are always\nbalanced by equal entropy decreases. For many of the more advanced students\n(calculus-based and upper level), we detect a tendency to expect entropy\nincreases even in processes in which the entropy does not change. We observed a\nwidespread failure to correctly apply the relationship {\\Delta}S =\n{\\delta}Qreversible/T, either by using it for irreversible processes to which\nit does not apply, or by applying it incorrectly or completely neglecting it in\nreversible processes to which it does apply.

Students at all levels were very\nfrequently found to be confused that while net entropy (system + reservoir) in\nreversible isothermal processes does not change, the entropy of the working\nsubstance itself does indeed increase or decrease depending on whether the\nprocess is an expansion or compression.

        "summary": "  Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) is a rapidly developing\nfield that leverages the skills of experts from many disciplines to utilize the\npotential of quantum systems in a variety of applications. It requires talent\nfrom a wide variety of traditional fields, including physics, engineering,\nchemistry, and computer science, to name a few. To prepare students for such\nopportunities, it is important to give them a strong foundation in the basics\nof QISE, in which quantum computing plays a central role. In this study, we\ndiscuss the development, validation, and evaluation of a QuILT, or Quantum\nInteractive Learning Tutorial, on the basics and applications of quantum\ncomputing. These include an overview of key quantum mechanical concepts\nrelevant for quantum computation (including ways a quantum computer is\ndifferent from a classical computer), properties of single- and multi-qubit\nsystems, and the basics of single-qubit quantum gates. The tutorial uses guided\ninquiry-based teaching-learning sequences. Its development and validation\ninvolved conducting cognitive task analysis from both expert and student\nperspectives and using common student difficulties as a guide. The\ninquiry-based learning sequences in the tutorial provide scaffolding support to\nhelp students develop a functional understanding. The final version of the\nvalidated tutorial was implemented in two distinct courses offered by the\nphysics department with slightly different student populations and broader\ncourse goals. Students' understanding was evaluated after traditional\nlecture-based instruction on the requisite concepts, and again after engaging\nwith the tutorial. We analyze and discuss their improvement in performance on\nconcepts covered in the tutorial.\n",

Despite the importance of institution-level, longitudinal analyses in\nunderstanding degree awarding gaps, detailed multivariate and hierarchical\nanalyses remain limited within the UK context. This study addresses this gap by\nusing a multivariate binary logistic model with random intercepts for STEM\nsubjects to analyse predictors of first-class degree outcomes using a nine-year\ndataset (2014 to 2022) from a research-intensive Russell Group university. We\nfind that prior academic attainment, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status,\ndisability, age, and course duration are significant predictors of achieving a\nfirst-class degree, with Average Marginal Effects calculated to provide insight\ninto probability differences across these groups. Key findings reveal that\nBlack students face a significantly lower likelihood of achieving first-class\ndegrees compared to White students, with an average 16 percent lower\nprobability, while students graduating from 4-year degree programmes have an\naverage 24 percent higher probability of achieving a first-class degree\nrelative to those on 3-year programmes. Although male students received a\nhigher proportion of first-class degrees overall, our multivariate hierarchical\nmodel shows higher odds for female students, underscoring the importance of\nmodel choice when quantifying awarding gaps. Baseline odds for first-class\noutcomes rose considerably from 2016, peaking in 2021, indicating possible\ngrade inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interaction effects between\nsocio-demographic variables and graduation year indicate stability in\nethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic awarding gaps but reveal a declining\nadvantage for female students over time.\n",

For any object in a running\nelevator, the variation of the acceleration of the elevator causes the\nvariation of the apparent weight of the object. We have studied the time\ndependence of the apparent weight of the object and thus the acceleration of\nthe elevator. For chosen initial and final floors, we measured the apparent\nweight of an object by using an electronic scale inside the elevator, and shot\nthe readings of the scale and a watch during the movement of the elevator. Then\nwe analyzed the data collected from the recorded video. If the initial and\nfinal floors are exchanged, the variations of the weight and acceleration are,\nrespectively, same in magnitudes and opposite in signs. The experiments\nindicate that for the elevator to go directly from a floor to another, the\nprocess consists of periods with variable acceleration, constant acceleration,\nuniform motion, variable deceleration, constant deceleration and variable\ndeceleration consecutively. If there are pauses during the movement, each pause\ncauses an additional process consisting of periods with deceleration, stop and\nacceleration, replacing the original period of constant motion. Depending on\nthe distance to the destination, the elevator reduces or diminishes the periods\nof constant acceleration and uniform motion.\n",

Now we compare the\noriginal success of CLASP with an implementation at a second institution. We\nfind that the original results hold at another institution despite some changes\nto the original curriculum and a somewhat different student population. We find\nthat students who take CLASP are 1) less likely to drop, 2) less likely to\nfail, and 3) do as well in later coursework when compared to students who took\nthe courses that CLASP replaced, even if that coursework is not similarly\nreformed. We find the above items to be independently true for historically\nmarginalized students and remarkably, also find that 4) marginalized students\nwho take CLASP are more likely to graduate from a STEM field. We use a course\ndeficit model perspective to examine these results, and discuss some of the\nfactors that may have contributed to this success.

Participants (N=10), all of whom identified with\ntraditionally marginalized groups in astronomy, were recruited from two large\nuniversities in New York State at different stages in their undergraduate\ncareers. Social cognitive career theory and the physics identity framework\nconceptually guided the analysis of astronomy identity for undergraduate majors\nand undergraduate astronomy researchers by exploring participants interest in,\nchoice to study, and persistence in astronomy. Themes related to astronomy\ninterest were popular culture and directly observing astronomical phenomena,\nwhile astronomy choice and persistence were facilitated by experiences in\nintroductory coursework, recognition from faculty, and socializing with peers.\nThe emergent astronomy identity framework was characterized by six distinct yet\ninterrelated constructs: 1) interest, typically rooted in observing naturally\noccurring phenomena and engaging with popular culture; 2) recognition from\npeers, experts, and families; 3) peer socialization; 4) competence; 5) sense of\nbelonging; and 6) astronomy career expectations. Implications from this\nresearch provide insights on factors that influence undergraduates in four-year\ncolleges to study astronomy, and how students' past experiences lead to a\nnatural interest in astronomy that may be fostered in secondary and\npost-secondary contexts. Findings suggest departments and institutions may\nfacilitate the accessibility of astronomy at the collegiate level by promoting\na more inclusive astronomy community, fostering interactions with astronomy\nfaculty and graduate students, providing opportunities for undergraduate\nresearch, and communicating expectancy for astronomy-related future careers.\n",

Although many educational resources introduce chemists to\nthe FT, they often require familiarity with sophisticated mathematical and\ncomputational concepts. Here, we present a series of three self-contained,\nPython-based laboratory activities for undergraduates to understand the FT and\napply it to analyze audio signals, an infrared (IR) spectroscopy interferogram,\nand a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) free induction decay (FID). In these\nactivities, students observe how the FT reveals and quantifies the contribution\nof each frequency present in a temporal signal and how decay timescales dictate\nsignal broadening. Our activities empower students with the tools to transform\ntheir own temporal datasets (e.g., FID) to a frequency spectrum. To ensure\naccessibility of the activities and lower the barrier to implementation, we\nutilize Google Colab's open-source, cloud-based platform to run Jupyter\nnotebooks.

Furthermore, instructors are limited in the usefulness of the feedback\nthey can give to the students involved. To address these issues, we propose the\nuse of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and increasing the frequency of\nCAT-based assessments during the course, while reducing the test length per\nadministration, thus keeping or decreasing the total number of test items\nadministered throughout the course. The feasibility of this idea depends on how\nfar the test length per administration can be reduced without compromising the\ntest accuracy and precision. Specifically, the overall test length is desired\nto be shorter than when the full assessment is administered as a pretest and\nsubsequent post-test. To achieve this goal, we developed a CAT algorithm that\nwe call Chain-CAT. This algorithm sequentially links the results of each CAT\nadministration using collateral information. We developed the Chain-CAT\nalgorithm using the items of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and analyzed the\nefficiency by numerical simulations. We found that collateral information\nsignificantly improved the test efficiency, and the overall test length could\nbe shorter than the pre-post method. Without constraints for item balancing and\nexposure control, simulation results indicated that the efficiency of Chain-CAT\nis comparable to that of the pre-post method even if the length of each CAT\nadministration is only 5 items and the CAT is administered 9 times throughout\nthe semester.

        "summary": "  Scientific literacy, a central goal of modern science education, should be\naccessible to all students regardless of their backgrounds. Despite\ninternational education reforms focused on diversity, equity and inclusion many\nteachers struggle to create inclusive science lessons. One reason may be, that\ncreating inclusive science lessons is challenging: it requires teachers to\nbalance the demands of science education with the diverse needs of their\nstudents. Therefore, teachers need support in planning inclusive science\nlessons. To address this issue, members of a German network for inclusive\nscience education (Netzwerk inklusiver naturwissenschaftlicher Unterricht,\nNinU) have developed the NinU framework. This framework integrates perspectives\nfrom both science education and inclusive pedagogy to support teachers in\nplanning and reflecting inclusive science lessons. Originally created as a\nworkshop resource for the NARST 2023 conference, this self-study manual\nprovides 1) an overview of the theory behind the NinU framework, 2) examples\nand 3) exercises for acknowledging diversity, recognizing barriers and enabling\nparticipation using the framework.\n",

In this work, we analyzed\ndata from multiple sources from a teaching Community of Practice (CoP) to\ninvestigate (a) barriers to using open-ended labs in physics classes, (b)\nshifts in teachers' beliefs about the use of open-ended labs in their classes\nduring teachers' engagement in a physics teacher CoP in a partnership program,\nand (c) a case study of one teachers whose shifts in perceptions about\nopen-ended labs led to her successful implementation of an open-ended lab in\nher class. The findings confirm the existence of well-known psychological and\nstructural barriers that can prevent teachers from adopting investigative\napproaches in teaching physics labs. Moreover, we learned how the interaction\nof these barriers further complicates the adoption of open-ended approaches in\nphysics classes. The study also revealed a significant gap between teachers'\ncurrent practices and their desired method for conducting labs, particularly in\nterms of structured versus open-ended approaches. The case study offered deeper\ninsights into how shifts in teaching practices occur through changes in\nperceptions within a supportive CoP.\n",

        "summary": "  Pictures in physics education go beyond instructional functions and serve\naffective roles, such as attracting attention, creating fascination, and\nfostering engagement with the depicted content. Recognizing the importance of\nthese affective functions highlights the need to understand and utilize\naesthetic pictures in a research-based educational environment. Prior research\nsuggests that aesthetic and affective attractiveness in pictures enhances\nenjoyment and engagement with the physics content. This paper offers three main\ncontributions: Firstly, it conceptualizes and presents research-based criteria\nfor selecting pictures perceived as aesthetically pleasing, drawing on insights\nfrom psychology and physics education research. Following these criteria,\naesthetic pictures related to a given curricular content can be selected.\nSecondly, the paper applies these criteria to selecting pictures showing\ngeometrical optics. It then delves into an evaluation of students' aesthetic\nand affective perception of the selected pictures. A validated instrument\nmeasured these responses, showing strong reliability (aesthetic perception:\n$\\alpha_C$ = 0.87 [0.85, 0.89]; affective perception: $\\alpha_C$ = 0.82 [0.80,\n0.85]). Thirdly, it combines decorative and instructional functions in tasks\nand compares students' perceptions of aesthetic pictures (AP) and classroom\nexperiment pictures (CEP) in junior high school ($N$ = 118), using a crossover\ndesign. Results indicated significantly better aesthetic and affective\nevaluations for APs, with large effect sizes (AP vs. CEP, aesthetic and\naffective perception: $d$ = 1.05 - 1.56 and 0.85 - 1.48, respectively). We\nconclude that the here developed and investigated criteria are useful for\nselecting aesthetic and affective pictures. This provides a basis for further\nleveraging their educational potential to create fascination and engagement in\nscience education.\n",

The validity of the\nitems was tested by factor analysis using the extraction method of principal\ncomponent analysis with varimax rotation. Reliability tests for the different\nconstructs were conducted by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Frequency, mean,\nstandard deviation and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze the data. The\nresults revealed that pre-service elementary teachers have generally neutral\nattitudes toward integrated STEM education, and they also showed that\npre-service teachers' attitudes toward integrated STEM education do not depend\non gender or grade level. However, these attitudes are dependent on\npre-university studies.

        "summary": "  Investigating students' thinking in classroom tasks, particularly in science\nand engineering, is essential for improving educational practices and advancing\nstudent learning. In this context, the notion of Ways of Thinking (WoT) has\ngained traction in STEM education, offering a framework to explore how students\napproach and solve interdisciplinary problems. Building on our earlier studies\nand contributing to ongoing discussions on WoT frameworks, this paper\nintroduces a new WoT framework: Ways of Thinking in Engineering Design based\nPhysics (WoT4EDP). WoT4EDP integrates five key elements: design, science,\nmathematics, metacognitive reflection, and computational thinking within an\nundergraduate introductory physics laboratory. This framework offers a novel\nperspective by emphasizing how these interconnected elements work together to\nfoster deeper learning and holistic problem-solving in Engineering Design based\nprojects. A key takeaway is that this framework serves as a practical tool for\neducators and researchers to design, implement, and analyze interdisciplinary\nSTEM activities in physics classrooms. We describe the development of WoT4EDP,\nsituate it within the broader landscape of undergraduate STEM education, and\nprovide detailed characterizations of its components. Additionally, we compare\nWoT4EDP with two contemporary frameworks: Dalal et al. (2021) and English\n(2023), to glean insights that enhance its application and promote\ninterdisciplinary thinking. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In\nthe upcoming second part, we will demonstrate the application of the WoT4EDP\nframework, showcasing how it can be used to analyze student thinking in\nreal-world, ED-based physics projects.\n",

Beyond their academic relevance, graphs find extensive utility in\neveryday scenarios, ranging from news media to educational materials. This\nunderscores the importance of people's being able to understand graphs.\nHowever, the ability to understand graphs is connected to the ability to create\ngraphs. Therefore, in school education, particularly in STEM subjects, not only\nthe understanding but also the skill of constructing graphs from numerical data\nis emphasized. Although constructing graphs is a skill that most people do not\nrequire in their everyday lives and professions, it is a well-established\nstudent activity that has been empirically studied several times. Therefore,\nsince a synthesis of the research findings on this topic has not yet been\nconducted, a summary of the studies investigating graphing via various\nviewpoints and differing methods could be a valuable contribution. To provide\nan overview of the empirical literature on this important topic, our systematic\nreview identifies how the construction of convention-based graphical\nrepresentations of numerical data, referred to as graphing, has been studied in\nprevious research, how effective graphing is, and which types of difficulties\nare encountered by students. Based on these aspects, we defined inclusion\ncriteria that led to 50 peer-reviewed empirical studies on graphing in K-12\nSTEM education found in SCOPUS, ERIC, and PsychInfo. Graphing instruction\nseemed to be beneficial for student learning, not only improving graph\nconstruction but also graph interpretation skills. However, the students\nexperienced various difficulties during graphing, both during graph\nconstruction and the interpretation and usage of data.\n",

Smartphones enable inexpensive physics experiments with digitized\nfirst-hand data collection outside lab settings. Such student experiments can\nenhance homework assignments, breaking down barriers between lectures,\nrecitation groups, and labs, and thereby linking theoretical and experimental\naspects of undergraduate physics education. To explore this potential, we\nimplemented and evaluated a sample set of nine smartphone-based experimental\ntasks and three programming tasks as weekly exercises in a first-year physics\ncourse at RWTH Aachen University. Through twelve short surveys involving up to\n188 participants, we investigated students' perceptions of learning with the\nnew tasks, focusing on factors such as goal clarity, difficulty, or feasibility\nat home. In two additional surveys with 108 and 78 participants, students\ncompared the new experimental and programming tasks to each other and to\nstandard recitation tasks based on affective variables. Our findings indicate\nthat the smartphone-based experimental tasks were generally well-suited to the\nstudents, which tended to outperform the programming tasks in terms of\nperceptions of learning with the tasks and affective responses. Overall,\nstudents responded positively to the new experimental tasks, with perceptions\ncomparable to, or only partly below those of established standard recitation\ntasks. Given that most of the experimental tasks were newly implemented\n\"on-the-fly\" within a running course, while the standard recitation tasks have\nbeen refined over years, these results are encouraging.

The following LLMs were tested: Gemini 1.5 Pro,\nGPT-4, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The results show AI grading is prone to\nmathematical errors and hallucinations, which render it less effective than\nhuman grading, but when given a mark scheme, there is substantial improvement\nin grading quality, which becomes closer to the level of human performance -\npromising for future AI implementation. Evidence indicates that the grading\nability of LLM is correlated with its problem-solving ability.

Students were instructed to write down verbal explanations of their\nreasoning process when solving one conceptual and two numerical calculation\nproblems on in class exams. The explanations were then graded according to a\n3-item rubric with each item grades as binary (1 or 0). We first demonstrate\nthat machine grading using GPT-4o with no examples nor reference answer can\nreliably agree with human graders on 70%-80% of all cases, which is equal to or\nhigher than the level at which two human graders agree with each other. Two\nmethods are essential for achieving this level of accuracy: 1. Adding\nexplanation language to each rubric item that targets the errors of initial\nmachine grading. 2. Running the grading process 5 times and taking the most\nfrequent outcome. Next, we show that the variation in outcomes across 5 machine\ngrading attempts as measured by the Shannon Entropy can serve as a grading\nconfidence index, allowing a human instructor to identify ~40% of all\npotentially incorrect gradings by reviewing just 10 - 15% of all responses.\nFinally, we show that it is straightforward to use GPT-4o to write clear\nexplanations of the partial credit grading outcomes. Those explanations can be\nused as feedback for students, which will allow students to understand their\ngrades and raise different opinions when necessary. Almost all feedback\nmessages generated were rated 3 or above on a 5-point scale by two experienced\ninstructors. The entire grading and feedback generating process cost roughly $5\nper 100 student answers, which shows immense promise for automating\nlabor-intensive grading process by a combination of machine grading with human\ninput and supervision.\n",

To mitigate these disparities in\nstudent preparedness, we developed a two-pronged intervention consisting of (1)\nincentivized supplemental mathematics assignments and (2) AI-generated learning\nsupport tools in the forms of optional hints embedded in the physics\nassignments. Both interventions are grounded in the Situated Expectancy-Value\nTheory of Achievement Motivation, which posits that students are more likely to\ncomplete a task that they expect to do well in and whose outcomes they think\nare valuable. For the supplemental math assignments, the extra credit available\nwas scaled to make it worth more points for the students with lower exam\nscores, thereby creating even greater value for the students who might most\nbenefit from the assignments. For the AI-generated hints, these were integrated\ninto the homework assignments, thereby reducing or eliminating the cost to the\nstudent, in terms of time, energy, and social barriers or fear of judgment. Our\nfindings indicate that both these interventions are associated with increased\nexam scores; in particular, the scaled extra credit reduced disparities in\ncompletion of math supplemental material and was associated with reducing\nracial disparities in exam scores.

Now the question is: After I close this switch, how long would it\ntake for the light bulb to light up: Is it half a second, one second, two\nseconds, 1m/c or none of the above?\n  As part of the Physics Specialist Camp 2022 in Seifhennersdorf -- a final\nevent of the Saxon Physics Olympiad -- students from grades 9 and 10 built a\nminiature model consisting of a printed circuit board and two 10-meter cables\nto experimentally study the question.

It is based on the working knowledge and best practices\ndeveloped by the Access Network, a collection of nine student-led communities\nat universities across the country working towards a vision of a more diverse,\nequitable, inclusive, and accessible STEM environment. Many of these\ncommunities, also referred to as sites, include a near-peer mentoring program\nthat is developed to best support their local context. The format of these\nprograms vary, ranging from structured classes with peer mentoring groups to\nstudent clubs supporting 1-on-1 relationships. To further support program\nparticipants as both students and as whole people, sites often run additional\nevents such as lecture series, workshops, and social activities guided tailored\nto each student community's needs. Through this process, student leaders have\ngenerated and honed best practices for all aspects of running their sites. This\nguide is an attempt to synthesize those efforts, offering practical advice for\nstudent leaders setting up near-peer mentorship programs in their own\ndepartments. It has been written through the lens of undergraduate near-peer\nmentorship programs, although our framework could easily be extended to other\ndemographics (e.g. high schoolers, graduate students, etc.). Our experience is\nwith STEM mentorship specifically, though these practices can extend to any\ndiscipline. In this document, we outline best practices for designing, running,\nand sustaining near-peer mentorship programs. We provide template resources to\nassist with this work, and lesson plans to run mentor and mentee training\nsessions. We hope you find this guide useful in designing, implementing, and\nre-evaluating community oriented near-peer mentoring programs.\n",

The teaching strategy integrates active learning strategies and\ncombines theoretical ideas with practical, physics-related examples. Students\nengage with key technical concepts, such as word embeddings, through hands-on\nexploration of the Word2Vec neural network and GPT-2 - an LLM that gained a lot\nof attention in 2019 for its ability to generate coherent and plausible text\nfrom simple prompts.\n  The activities highlight how words acquire meaning and how LLMs predict\nsubsequent tokens by simulating simplified scenarios related to physics. By\nfocusing on Word2Vec and GPT-2, the exercises illustrate fundamental principles\nunderlying modern LLMs, such as semantic representation and contextual\nprediction. Through interactive experimenting in Google Colab, students observe\nthe relationship between model parameters (such as temperature) in GPT-2 and\noutput behaviour, understand scaling laws relating data quantity to model\nperformance, and gain practical insights into the predictive capabilities of\nLLMs. This approach allows students to begin to understand how these systems\nwork by linking them to physics concepts - systems that will shape their\nacademic studies, professional careers and roles in society.\n",

In particular, the provision of informationally\nredundant external representations can have advantageous effects on learning\noutcomes. This is of special relevance for quantum education, where various\nexternal representations are available and their effective use is recognised as\ncrucial to student learning. However, research on the effects of\ninformationally redundant external representations in quantum learning is\nlimited. The present study aims to contribute to the development of effective\nlearning materials by investigating the effects of learning with\ninformationally redundant external representations on students' learning of\nquantum physics. Using a between-subjects design, 113 students were randomly\nassigned to one of four learning conditions. The control group learnt with a\ntraditional multimedia learning unit on the behaviour of a single photon in a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer. The three intervention groups received redundant\nessential information in the Dirac formalism, the Bloch sphere, or both. The\nuse of eye tracking enabled insight into the learning process depending on the\nexternal representations provided. While the results indicate no effect of the\nstudy condition on learning outcomes (content knowledge and cognitive load),\nthe analysis of visual behaviour reveals decreased learning efficiency with the\naddition of the Bloch sphere to the multimedia learning unit. The results are\ndiscussed based on current insight in learning with MERs. The study emphasises\nthe need for careful instructional design to balance the associated cognitive\nload when learning with informationally redundant external representations.\n",

We call them shortly the\n``driving weights'' (dw). Let N be their number, a large one.\n  To determine the work performed by the ideal gas in the cycle the ``driving\nweights'' must be handled carefully. If we let them move on-off the piston only\nhorizontally, their vertical motions will be due only to the gas. Here we show\nthat, at the end, while some of them will have moved down (will have negative\nraising) the remaining ones (the majority) will have moved up (will have\npositive raising) so that the total work performed by the ideal gas equals the\ntotal variation of the gravitational potential energy of the ``driving\nweghts''.\n  The cycle is performed in 2N time-steps. For each step t_i, with i in\n1,..,2N, we give H(t_i), and DH(t_{i-1},t_i), respectively the height and the\nraising of the piston. Moreover the overall raising of the individual dw's\n(i.e. h_k, with k in 1...N), and their distribution are given in simple,\ngeneral cases. The efficiency and the dissipated work are also evaluated.\n  This paper is aimed at imparting a deeper understanding of the ideal Carnot\nEngine and may also be useful as a segment in a didactic path on elementary\ncalculus and statistics.\n",

The work for which they have been awarded the Nobel\nPrize was done in 1971.

This was done in a\nseries of measurements in the experiments in the accelerator laboratories at\nCERN (Geneva) and Fermilab. To understand the full significance of this Nobel\nPrize, we will have to summarise briefly the developement of our current\ntheoretical framework about the basic constituents of matter and the forces\nwhich hold them together. In fact the path can be partially traced in a chain\nof Nobel prizes starting from one in 1965 to S. Tomonaga, J. Schwinger and R.\nFeynman, to the one to S.L. Glashow, A. Salam and S.

I show that, in an inertial frame of reference where\nthe dynamical equations are valid, it is incorrect to drop the quadratic terms\nbecause they are as large as the linear terms that are kept. I provide an\nalternate formulation of the problem by transforming the dynamical equations to\na corotating frame of reference of the disk/cylinder, where dropping the\nquadratic terms in displacement gradient is justified. The analysis shows that\nthe classic textbook derivation of stress and strain must be interpreted as\nbeing carried out in the corotating frame of the medium.\n",

The treatment leads to a simple\ninterpretation of the pressure in Fermi and Bose systems in terms of the\nmomentum flow encoded in the wave functions. I apply the methods to several\nproblems, investigating the properties of quasi continuous systems, relations\nfor Fermi and Bose pressures, shape-dependent effects and anisotropies, and the\ntreatment of particles in external fields, and note several interesting\nproblems for graduate courses in statistical mechanics that arise naturally in\nthe context of these examples.\n",

A comparative description of relativistic and classical\nmechanics is given using three main principles: the definition of momentum, the\nmain law of dynamics (Newton's second law) and the law of conservation of\nenergy. The difference of relativistic mechanics from classical mechanics is\ndue to the new definition of momentum that is proportional to energy and\nvelocity. It is shown that new relativistic laws of dynamics make it necessary\nto change kinematical relations of classical mechanics such as the law of\nvelocity composition, coordinate transformation etc. It is demonstrated that\nquantum mechanics may be considered as a rational statistical generalization of\nclassical mechanics. Statistical conformities in quantum mechanics are\nfundamental and are not due to the incomplete information about the system.\n  From all possible multi-parametric statistical models the root model is most\nremarkable. Constructing of a root multi-parametric statistical model leads to\nobtaining such frequencies and base functions in Fourier decomposition so that\nclassical laws of motion are fulfilled in average. Root model leads to a\nconsistent condition that connects eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a mechanical\nsystem that is described by a matrix equation of Heisenberg. Matrix equation of\nHeisenberg leads to an operator equation. The solution of the operator equation\nmay be considered as the construction of Hamiltonian of the system and a move\nto the Schrodinger representation. The considered approach naturally leads to\nthe notion of momentum operator, fundamental commutation relations, density\nmatrix and Liouville equation construction etc.\n",

In\nparticular, an alternative derivation of the effects described by special\nrelativity is provided, which is based on a description that assumes a\nprivileged reference frame. The present theory follows the ideas of Lorentz and\nPoincare, abandoning a strict view of Einstein's \"equivalence\" of all inertial\nframes. The meaning of the Principle of Relativity is discussed and elucidated,\nand it is shown that it is not incompatible with the existence of a preferred,\nabsolute, frame. Most scientists nowadays still consider the basic assumptions\nof the theory proposed here to be plain wrong. Moreover, they tend to see an\nirreconcilable conflict between the Lorentz-Poincare and the Einstein-Minkowski\nformulations. However, as stated by John Bell [Bell1988], although there is a\nstringent \"difference in philosophy\" between both views, \"the facts of physics\ndo not oblige us to accept one philosophy rather than the other\". The validity\nof Bell's assertion is unambiguously demonstrated, and it is shown how and why\nboth approaches do indeed agree in the description of (most of?) the physical\nphenomena. Evidently, the physical meaning of the different physical quantities\n- such as \"time\", \"speed\", \"simultaneity\" and \"synchronization\" - is quite\ndifferent in both programmes. And yet, for perplexing it may look at first\nsight, the present theory, developed under the Lorentz-Poincare assumption of a\npreferred reference frame, somehow encompasses Einstein's theory. There is no\nconflict, as there is one theory. It is stressed that reality is not changed by\nthe choices one makes to describe it, so it is not changed by the particular\nway in which the clocks have been set.\n",

The system has been specifically\noptimized for kinetic measurements in a pump-probe fashion. This requires\naveraging over many shots which necessitates stable, reliable generation of\nelectron pulses. The latter were used to generate excess electrons in pulse\nradiolysis of liquid water and concentrated solutions of perchloric acid. The\nhydronium ions in the acidic solutions react with the hydrated electrons\nresulting in the rapid decay of the transient absorbance at 800 nm on the\npicosecond time scale. Time resolution of a few picoseconds has been\ndemonstrated. The current time resolution is determined primarily by the\nphysical dimensions of the sample and the detection sensitivity. Subpicosecond\ntime resolution can be achieved by using thinner samples, more sensitive\ndetection techniques and improved electron beam quality.\n",

A rigorous\nanalysis of the laws governing this problem involves solving Maxwell's\nequations in a time-dependent situation.

In this paper we\npresent a new method for the analysis of the magnetic braking using a magnet\nfixed to the glider of an air track. The forces acting on the glider, a result\nof the eddy currents, can be easily observed and measured. As a consequence of\nthe air track inclination, the glider accelerates at the beginning, although it\nasymptotically tends towards a uniform rectilinear movement characterized by a\nterminal speed. This speed depends on the interaction between the magnetic\nfield and the conductivity properties of the air track. Compared with previous\nrelated approaches, in our experimental setup the magnet fixed to the glider\nproduces a magnetic braking force which acts continuously, rather than over a\nshort period of time. The experimental results satisfactorily concur with the\ntheoretical models adapted to this configuration.\n",

The method has been welcomed by the science\ncommunity and adopted by a large number of colleges and universities, due among\nother reasons to its common sense approach and its documented effectiveness. In\nPI, the progression of any given class depends on the outcome of real-time\nstudent feedback to ConcepTests: multiple-choice conceptual questions. In the\nearly 1990s, students responded to ConcepTests using flashcards showing their\nanswer. Instructors would then estimate the proportion of students holding each\nalternative conception. A few years later Mazur began using wireless handheld\ndevices - colloquially called clickers- to replace the flashcards. Previous\nusers of clickers in university classrooms had reported benefits such as\nincreased rates of attendance and decreased rates of attrition (Owens et al.,\n2004; Lopez-Herrejon & Schulman, 2004). This paper empirically measures the\nspecific contribution of clickers to conceptual learning and traditional\nproblem solving skills as compared to low-budget flashcards. Results show that\nclickers do not provide any learning advantage when compared to flashcards.\nNevertheless, clickers offer many advantages from a teaching perspective which\nshould be considered.\n",

[We studied ourselves the material existing at the\nUniversity of Catania, Catania, Italy, almost 600 years old].

By the present\n\"small book\" we want to make known the antique physics instruments that are in\npossession of three Senior High Schools of Bergamo, Italy: the \"Istituto\nTecnico Vittorio Emanuele\", the \"Liceo Scientifico Lussana\", and the \"Istituto\nper Geometri Quarenghi\". Namely, we catalogue and describe: 61 instruments of\nthe \"Vittorio Emanuele\" (52 of the second half of the XIX century, and 9 of the\nfirst half of the XX century); 100 instruments of the \"Lussana\" (belonging\nessentially to the first half of the XX century); and 26 instruments, mainly\ntopographical in this case, of the \"Quarenghi\" (8 of the second half of the XIX\ncentury, and 16 of the first half of the XX century); without forgetting to add\nsuitable explanations about their functioning. Our aim will be reached if we\nhappen to stimulate other colleagues to perform similar work in their towns.\nThe present small book is in Italian, but it contains fifty-one (51)\nself-explanatory photographs in color, and nineteen (19) black-and-white\nsketches.

And, on the contrary, it would be\nreally amazing if it could remain at rest always at the same place, like the\nEarth>>. While Posidonius (circa 135-51 BC) had written: <<Matter is endowed\nwith a cohesion that keeps it together and against which the surrounding vacuum\nhas no power. Indeed, the material world is supported by an immense force, and\nalternately contracts and expands in the vacuum following its own physical\nprocesses, now consumed by fire, now, instead, giving rise to a new creation of\nthe cosmos>>. These two examples show how \"modern\" was part of the ancient\nGreek physics, frequently overlooked since it is sometimes known through the\npraiseworthy translations of scholars often competent in humanities, more than\nin science.

Gravitational waves, the\n\"ripples in space-time\" predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity,\nare produced by some of the most energetic and dramatic phenomena in the\ncosmos, including black holes, neutron stars and supernovae. The detection of\ngravitational waves will help to address a number of fundamental questions in\nphysics, from the evolution of stars and galaxies to the origin of dark energy\nand the nature of space-time itself. Moreover, the cutting-edge technology\ndeveloped to search for gravitational waves is pushing back the frontiers of\nmany fields, from lasers and materials science to high performance computing,\nand thus provides a powerful showcase for the attractions and challenges of a\ncareer in science and engineering. For several years a worldwide network of\nground-based laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors has been fully\noperational, including the two LIGO detectors in the United States. These\ndetectors are already among the most sensitive scientific instruments on the\nplanet and in the next few years their sensitivity will achieve further\nsignificant improvement. Those developments promise to open an exciting new\nwindow on the Universe, heralding the arrival of gravitational-wave astronomy\nas a revolutionary, new observational field.

A list\nof new possible occupations will be promoted for inclusion in the National\nQualifications Register for Higher Education. Finally, we analyze the vision\nexisting in this region on the higher education qualifications against the\nEuropean vision and experience, in particular in training of Master students,\nPhD students, and senior teaching and research staff through the Network, i.e.\nmultilateral and bilateral programs.\n",

In this work we present the instrument\nwe designed to put in evidence some of the most frequently used models on a few\nbasic astronomical notions endowed by them. We work with an open written\nquestionnaire comprising a limited but representative group of basic\nastronomical notions. We discuss the results of two first pilot tests, provided\nto 30 individuals, and we comment on the necessary changes applied to the\ninstrument in order to design the final questionnaire, which was then provided\nto another group of 51 pre-service elementary teachers. A detailed qualitative\nanalysis of the answers revealed many well-known alternative conceptions, and\nothers that seem new. We find that prospective teachers have a hard time in\ntrying to explain the movements of the Moon and its phases. They also meet\ndifficulties to recognize and explain a couple of astronomical elements that\nmake part of our ordinary language, like the origin of a shooting star and the\nreal identity of the \"lucero\" (i.e., planet Venus). Amongst the answers offered\nto explain the causes of the seasons, we found a singular causality, which we\nthink has not been sufficiently emphasized in the literature so far. Many of\nthe inquired people did not advance an explicative model -a cause: say, the\ntilt of the Earth's axis- to justify a particular phenomenon -the effect: the\nseasons on the Earth-, but rather made use of another phenomenon/effect, in the\npresent case related to the climate, in order to explain the seasons. However,\nas we know, this phenomenon/effect (the climate) has a strong astronomical\ncomponent. We present here the full results of the first two tests and of the\nfinal instrument employed, and we draw some conclusions.\n",

Students majoring in other disciplines, like chemistry, biology or\nengineering rarely have the opportunity to learn about the most recent optical\ntechniques and mathematical representation used in today's science and industry\noptics. Stokes analysis of polarization of light is one of those methods that\nare increasingly necessary but are seldom taught outside advanced physics or\noptics classes that are limited to physics majors. On the other hand biology\nand chemistry majors already use matrix and polarization techniques in the labs\nfor their specialty, which makes the transition to matrix calculations\nseamless. Since most of the students in those majors postpone their enrollment\nin physics, most of the registered in those classes are juniors and seniors,\nenabling them to handle those techniques. We chose to study polymer samples to\naid students majoring in other disciplines, especially chemistry and\nengineering, with understanding of the optical nature of some of the objects of\ntheir study. The argument in this paper is that it is advantageous to introduce\nStokes analysis for those students and show a lab developed and taught for\nseveral years that has successfully, in our experience, done that. Measurements\nof oriented and unoriented polymer samples are discussed to demonstrate to\nstudents the effects of the molecular polarizability on the sample\nbirefringence and the anisotropic Fletcher indicatrix in general.\n",

A detailed exploration of\nstudent perspectives on the interpretation of quantum physics is needed, both\nto characterize student understanding of physics concepts, and to inform how we\nmight teach traditional content. Our previous investigations of student\nperspectives on quantum physics have indicated they can be highly nuanced, and\nmay vary both within and across contexts. In order to better understand the\ncontextual and often seemingly contradictory stances of students on matters of\ninterpretation, we interviewed 19 students from four introductory modern\nphysics courses taught at the University of Colorado. We find that students\nhave attitudes and opinions that often parallel the stances of expert\nphysicists when arguing for their favored interpretations of quantum mechanics,\nallowing for more nuanced characterizations of student perspectives in terms of\nthree key interpretive themes. We present a framework for characterizing\nstudent perspectives on quantum mechanics, and demonstrate its utility in\ninterpreting the sometimes-contradictory nature of student responses to\nprevious surveys.

We have developed a\nframework for understanding and characterizing student perspectives on the\nphysical interpretation of quantum mechanics, and demonstrate the differential\nimpact on student thinking of the myriad ways instructors approach interpretive\nthemes in their introductory courses.

Is the collapse of the wave function an ad hoc rule, or a\nphysical transition not described by any equation? Does an electron, being a\nform of matter, exist as a localized particle at all times? These questions,\nwhich are of personal and academic interest to our students, are largely only\nsuperficially addressed in our introductory courses, often for fear of opening\na Pandora's Box of student questions, none of which have easy answers.

While extra dimensions have received a wide coverage in\npublications over the last ten years (especially due to the prediction of micro\nblack hole production at the LHC), the phenomenology of models with a minimal\nlength is still less investigated. In a summer study project for bachelor\nstudents in 2010 we have explored some phenomenological implications of the\npotential existence of a minimal length. In this paper we review the idea and\nformalism of a quantum gravity induced minimal length in the generalised\nuncertainty principle framework as well as in the coherent state approach to\nnon-commutative geometry. These approaches are effective models which can make\nmodel-independent predictions for experiments and are ideally suited for\nphenomenological studies. Pedagogical examples are provided to grasp the\neffects of a quantum gravity induced minimal length. This article is intended\nfor graduate students and non-specialists interested in quantum gravity.\n",

With the purpose of increasing scientific vocations,\nworkshops were organized in high schools and teachers involved in planning and\nimplementation of laboratories, conferences for scientific outreach, thematic\nexhibitions, guided tours of research laboratories, summer's schools for\nstudents and courses for teachers were realized for developing a cultural\nenhancement in teaching basic sciences.

In\nparticular the visual beauty and excitement of the aurora make these lights a\nwonderful inspirational hook. A century ago Norwegian experimental physicist\nKristian Birkeland, one of the founding fathers of modern space science,\ndemonstrated with his Terrella experiment the formation of the aurora. Recently\na modernised version of the Terrella has been designed. This Planeterrella\nexperiment is very flexible, allowing the visualization of many phenomena\noccurring in our space environment. Although the Planeterrella was originally\ndesigned to be small to be demonstrated locally by a scientist, the\nPlaneterrella has proved to be a very successful public outreach experiment. We\nbelieve that its success is due to two main factors (i) the Planeterrella is\nnot patented and the plans are given freely to any public institution and (ii)\nthe advertisement does not rely on press release, books or web sites but mainly\non National and European scientific networks such as COST ES 0803. Today, nine\nPlaneterrellas are operating or under construction in four different countries,\nand more are in the pipleline. In five years, about 50,000 people in Europe\nhave been able to see live demonstrations of the formation of auroral lights,\npicture the space environment and get an introduction to space weather with\nthis experiment.

First, we compare the problems that biology students are typically\nasked to solve with authentic, complex problems. We then describe the\ndevelopment of research-validated physics curricula emphasizing process skills\nin problem solving. We show that solving authentic, complex biology problems\nrequires many of the same skills that practicing physicists and biologists use\nin representing problems, seeking relationships, making predictions, and\nverifying or checking solutions.

A brief history of general university\nand STEM teaching in the UAE is given. We present this secondary implementation\n(SI) as a case study of a novel context and use it to determine if PER-based\ninstruction can be successfully implemented far from the cultural context of\nthe primary developer and, if so, how might such SIs differ from SIs within the\nUS. With these questions in view, a pre-reform baseline of MPEX, FCI, course\nexam and English language proficiency data are used to design a hybrid\nimplementation of Cooperative Group Problem Solving. We find that for students\nwith high English proficiency, normalized gain on FCI improves from <g> =\n0.16+/-0.10 pre- to <g> = 0.47+/-0.08 post-reform, indicating successful SI. We\nalso find that <g> is strongly modulated by language proficiency and discuss\nlikely causes. Regardless of language skill, problem-solving skill is also\nimproved and course DFW rates drop from 50% to 24%. In particular, we find\nevidence in post-reform student interviews that prior classroom experiences,\nand not broader cultural expectations about education, are the more significant\ncause of expectations at odds with the classroom norms of well-functioning\nPER-based instruction. This result is evidence that PER-based innovations can\nbe implemented across great changes in cultural context, provided that the\nmethod is thoughtfully adapted in anticipation of context and culture-specific\nstudent expectations. This case study should be valuable for future reforms at\nother institutions, both in the Gulf Region and developing world, facing\nsimilar challenges involving SI of PER-based instruction outside the US.\n",

To make the course more interactive, laboratory tours for\nmicrofabrication facility, microscopy facility, and nanoscale laboratory at the\nUniversity of Iowa are included, which inculcate the practical feel of the\ntechnology. The course also involves active student participation through\nweekly student presentations, highlighting topics of interest to this field,\nwith the incentive of \"nano is everywhere\" Final term papers submitted by the\nstudents involve a rigorous technology analysis through various perspectives.\nFurthermore, a student based peer review process is developed which helps them\nto improve technical writing skills, as well as address the ethical issues of\nacademic honesty while reviewing and getting introduced to a new aspect of the\narea presented by their colleagues. Based on the chosen paper topics and\nstudent ratings, the student seemed motivated to learn about the novel area\nintroduced to them through theoretical, computational and experimental aspects\nof the bottom-up approach.\n",

Each layer casts\ngameplay as a co-construction of the game and the player, and contains three\ndynamical feedback loops: an exploratory learning loop, an intrinsic motivation\nloop, and an identity loop.\n",

Papert,\ndispleased with this inefficient learning process, championed physics\nmicroworlds, where students could experience a variety of laws of motion, from\nAristotle to Newton and Einstein or even new laws invented by the students\nthemselves. While often mistakenly seen as a game, Second Life (SL), the online\n3-D virtual world hosted by Linden Lab, imposes essentially no rules on the\nresidents beyond reasonable restrictions on improper behavior and the physical\nrules that guarantee its similitude to the real world. As a consequence, SL\nqualifies itself as an environment for personal discovery and exploration as\nproposed by constructivist theories. The physical laws are implemented through\nthe well-known physics engine Havok, whose design aims to provide game-players\na consistent, realistic environment. The Havok User Guide (2008) explicitly\nencourages developers to use several tricks to cheat the simulator in order to\nmake games funnier or easier to play. As it is shown in this study, SL physics\nis unexpectedly neither the Newtonian idealized physics nor a real world\nphysics virtualization, intentionally diverging from reality in such a way that\nit could be called hyper-real. As a matter of fact, if some of its features\nmake objects behave more realistically than real ones, certain quantities like\nenergy have a totally different meaning in SL as compared to physics. Far from\nconsidering it as a problem, however, the author argues that its hyper-reality\nmay be a golden teaching opportunity, allowing surreal physics simulations and\nepistemologically rich classroom discussions around the what is a physical law?\nissue, in accordance with Papert's never-implemented proposal.\n",

The framework posits that the challenges many students face in\ndeveloping expertise in quantum mechanics are analogous to the challenges\nintroductory students face in developing expertise in introductory classical\nmechanics. This framework incorporates both the diversity in upper-level\nstudents' prior preparation, goals, and motivation in general (i.e., the facts\nthat even in upper-level courses, students may be inadequately prepared, have\nunclear goals, and have insufficient motivation to excel) as well as the\n\"paradigm shift\" from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The framework\nis based on empirical investigations demonstrating that the patterns of\nreasoning, problem-solving, and self-monitoring difficulties in quantum\nmechanics bear a striking resemblance to those found in introductory classical\nmechanics. Examples from research in quantum mechanics and introductory\nclassical mechanics are discussed to illustrate how the patterns of\ndifficulties are analogous as students learn to unpack the respective\nprinciples and grasp the formalism in each knowledge domain during the\ndevelopment of expertise. Embracing such a framework and contemplating the\nparallels between the difficulties in these two knowledge domains can enable\nresearchers to leverage the extensive literature for introductory physics\neducation research to guide the design of teaching and learning tools for\nhelping students develop expertise in quantum mechanics.\n",

Some of these\nstudies were multi-university investigations. The investigations suggest that\nthere is large diversity in student performance in upper-level quantum\nmechanics regardless of the university, textbook, or instructor and many\nstudents in these courses have not acquired a functional understanding of the\nfundamental concepts. The nature of reasoning difficulties in learning quantum\nmechanics is analogous to reasoning difficulties found via research in\nintroductory physics courses. The reasoning difficulties were often due to\nover-generalizations of concepts learned in one context to another context\nwhere they are not directly applicable. Reasoning difficulties in\ndistinguishing between closely related concepts and in making sense of the\nformalism of quantum mechanics were common. We conclude with a brief summary of\nthe research-based approached that take advantage of research on student\ndifficulties in order to improve teaching and learning of quantum mechanics.\n",

Properly oriented according to the local meridian, this\ninstrument allows us to follow the shadows in any region of the Earth that is\nilluminated by the Sun, as well as offering a clear view of the terminator, the\nfast-moving grey line that divides the day from the night on our planet. With\nknowledge of the shadows, it is possible to estimate the latitude of a site and\nto infer local solar time anywhere in the planet's sunlit hemisphere.\nFurthermore, by using the parallel globe we may understand simply the existence\nof regions in which objects sometimes do not cast shadows, and also other\nregions which, on the contrary, sometimes become \"long-shadow\" countries. In\nthis work, we first review the device and the basics of its assembly and\noperation. In the second part, we describe in detail some activities targeted\nto facilitate its use in the classroom, which our research group has been\ndeveloping during teacher training workshops.\n",

The treatment of this\ntopic in standard textbooks has changed little over the last few decades, and\nsuch changes as have come to our notice leave, in our opinion, much to be\ndesired. The purpose of this article is to enable, even encourage, other\nteachers to give the finite square well the attention that it deserves; to this\nend, the authors provide a tutorial review that is more instructive and\ncomprehensive than the accounts presented in numerous textbooks and dispensed\nin still more numerous online resources, but does not make any additional\ndemands on the mathematical abilities of the student.

We focus especially on space radiation and its impact on space\nexploration. The topic is highly interdisciplinary bringing together\nfundamental concepts of nuclear physics with aspects of radiation protection\nand space science. We present a new approach to presenting the topic by\ndeveloping a web-based tool that combines some of the fundamental concepts from\nthese two fields in a single tool that can be developed in the context of\nadvanced secondary or undergraduate university education. We present DREADCode,\nan outreach or teaching tool to asses rapidly the current conditions of the\nradiation field in space. DREADCode uses the available data feeds from a number\nof ongoing space missions to produce a first order approximation of the dose an\nastronaut would receive during a mission of exploration in deep space.\nDREADcode is based on a intuitive GUI interface available online from the\nEuropean Space Weather Portal. The core of the radiation transport computation\nto produce the radiation dose from the observed fluence of radiation observed\nby the spacecraft fleet considered is based on a relatively simple\napproximation: the Bethe-Block equation. DREADCode assumes also a simplified\ngeometry and material configuration for the shields used to compute the dose.\nThe approach is approximate and it sacrifices some important physics on the\naltar of a rapid execution time allowing a real time operation scenario. There\nis no intention here to produce an operational tool for use in the space\nscience and engineering. Rather we present an educational tool at undergraduate\nlevel that uses modern web-based and programming methods to learn some of the\nmost important concepts in the application of radiation protection to space\nweather problems.\n",

Localization\nof all wave phenomena, including light, is thought to exist in a restricted one\ndimensional geometry. We present here a series of experiments which illustrate,\nusing a simple experimental arrangement and approach, localization of light in\na quasi one dimensional physical system. In the experiments, reflected and\ntransmitted light from a stack of glass slides of varying thickness reveals an\nOhm's Law type behavior for small thicknesses, and evolution to exponential\ndecay of the transmitted power for thicker slide stacks. Light absorption is\nnegligible in our realization of the experiment. For larger stacks of slides,\nweak departure from a one dimensional behavior is also observed. The experiment\nand analysis of the results, then showing many of the essential features of\nwave localization, is relatively straightforward, economical, and suitable for\nlaboratory experiments at an undergraduate level.\n",

The\naim is to provide a fairly complete solution to the relativity of the 'aging'\nof an object due to differences in the gravitational potential. This solution -\naccessible at the undergraduate level - can be used for educational purposes,\nas an example in the classroom. Finally, we also briefly discuss why exchanging\n'years' for 'days' - which in retrospect is a quite simple, but significant,\nmistake - has been repeated seemingly uncritically, albeit in a few cases only.\nThe pedagogical value of this discussion is to show students that any number or\nobservation, no matter who brought it forward, must be critically examined.\n",

Other courses contribute significantly to students' score\nvariance as well to the first principal component and they are responsible for\ndifferentiation of students' scores.

Quantum key distribution allows two parties,\ncommonly called Alice and Bob, to generate a secret sequence of 0s and 1s\ncalled a key that is only known to themselves. Classically, Alice and Bob could\nnever be certain that their communication was not compromised by a malicious\neavesdropper. Quantum mechanics however makes secure communication possible.\nThe fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that taking a measurement\nperturbs the system (unless the measurement is compatible with the quantum\nstate) also applies to an eavesdropper. Using appropriate protocols to create\nthe key, Alice and Bob can detect the presence of an eavesdropper by errors in\ntheir measurements. As part of the QuVis Quantum Mechanics Visualization\nProject, we have developed a suite of four interactive simulations that\ndemonstrate the basic principles of three different quantum key distribution\nprotocols. The simulations use either polarized photons or spin 1/2 particles\nas physical realizations. The simulations and accompanying activities are\nfreely available for use online or download, and run on a wide range of devices\nincluding tablets and PCs.

        "summary": "  The power of robotic telescopes to transform science education has been\nvoiced by multiple sources, since the 1980s. Since then, much technical\nprogress has been made in robotic telescope provision to end users via a\nvariety of different approaches. The educational transformation hoped for by\nthe provision of this technology has, so far, yet to be achieved on a scale\nmatching the technical advancements. In this paper, the history, definition,\nrole and rationale of optical robotic telescopes with a focus on their use in\neducation is provided. The current telescope access providers and educational\nprojects and their broad uses in traditional schooling, undergraduate and\noutreach are then outlined. From this background, the current challenges to the\nfield, which are numerous, are then presented. This review is concluded with a\nseries of recommendations for current and future projects that are apparent and\nhave emerged from the literature.\n",

To test\nprocesses underlying this assumed multimedia effect we collected performance\nscores, eye movements, and think-aloud protocols from students solving problems\nin vector calculus with and without graphs. Results showed no overall\nmultimedia effect, but instead an effect to confirm statements that were\naccompanied by graphs, irrespective of whether these statements were true or\nfalse. Eye movement and verbal data shed light on this surprising finding.\nStudents looked proportionally less at the text and the problem statement when\na graph was present. Moreover, they experienced more mental effort with the\ngraph, as indicated by more silent pauses in thinking aloud. Hence, students\nactively processed the graphs. This, however, was not sufficient. Further\nanalysis revealed that the more students looked at the statement, the better\nthey performed. Thus, in the multimedia condition the graph drew students'\nattention and cognitive capacities away from focusing on the statement. A good\nalternative strategy in the multimedia condition was to frequently look between\ngraph and problem statement, and thus to integrate their information. In\nconclusion, graphs influence where students look and what they process, and may\neven mislead them into believing accompanying information. Thus, teachers and\ntextbook designers should be very critical on when to use graphs and carefully\nconsider how the graphs are integrated with other parts of the problem.\n",

Depending on the power received on the\ncell, the motor begins to move. It changes also its speed with respect to the\ndistance between the cell and the lamp. This can be interpreted as a model for\na planetary system and its habitable zone. The \"engine of life\" moves as soon\nas the receiving power is big enough to sustain its operation. The distance,\nwhere the motor stops, can be interpreted as the outer edge of the habitable\nzone.

This analysis provides deeper insights than\nprior publications into both the LSCI as an instrument and into the\neffectiveness of teaching and learning in introductory astronomy courses. Our\nIRT analysis supports the classical test theory findings of prior studies using\nthe LSCI with this population. In particular, we found that students in classes\nthat used active learning strategies at least 25\\% of the time had average\nIRT-estimated learning gains that were approximately 1 logit larger than\nstudents in classes that spent less time on active learning strategies. We also\nfound that instructors who want their classes to achieve an improvement in\nabilities of average $\\Delta \\theta = 1$ logit must spend at least 25\\% of\nclass time on active learning strategies. However, our analysis also powerfully\nillustrates the lack of insight into student learning that is revealed by\nlooking at a single measure of learning gain, such as average $\\Delta \\theta$.\nEducators and researchers should also examine the distributions of students'\nabilities pre- and post-instruction in order to understand how many students\nactually achieved an improvement in their abilities and whether or not a\nmajority of students have moved to post-abilities significantly greater than\nthe national average.\n",

They were learner\nclassification, course attraction, teaching order and learning order. Based on\nviewing behavior data, we provided a non-parametric algorithm to categorize\nlearners, which helped to narrow the scope of finding potential all-rounders,\nand a method to measure the correlations between teaching order and learning\norder, which helped to assign teaching contents. Using information entropy, we\nprovided an index to measure course attraction, which integrated the viewing\ntime invested on courses and the number of viewed course videos. This index\ndescribes the diminishing marginal utility of repeated viewing and the\nincreasing information of viewing new videos. It has potential to be an\nauxiliary method of assessing course achievements.\n",

CLT differentiates three different kinds of cognitive load\n-- intrinsic, extraneous and germane load. Intrinsic load is related to the\nlearning goal, extraneous load costs cognitive resources but does not\ncontribute to learning. Germane load can foster learning. Objective methods,\nsuch as eye movement measures and EEG have been used measure the total\ncognitive load. Very few research studies, if any, have been completed to\nmeasure the three kinds of load separately with physiological methods in a\ncontinuous manner. In this current study, we will show how several eye-tracking\nbased parameters are related to the three kinds of load by having explicit\nmanipulation of the three loads independently. Participants having low prior\nknowledge regarding the learning material participated in the study. Working\nmemory capacity was also measured by an operation memory span task.\n",

However,\ndespite its fundamental and practical importance, in high school this property\nof light is often neglected. This is a pity not only for its conceptual\nrelevance, but also because polarization gives the possibility to perform many\nbeautiful experiments with low cost materials. Moreover, the treatment of this\nmatter lends very well to an interdisciplinary approach, between art, biology\nand technology, which usually makes things more interesting to students. For\nthese reasons we have developed a laboratory on light polarization for high\nschool and undergraduate students. They can see beautiful pictures when\nbirefringent materials are set between two crossed polarizing filters. The\ncolourful images remind them of those ones of abstract painting or alien\nlandscapes. With this multidisciplinary teaching method students are more\nengaged and participative and also the learning process of the respective\nphysics concepts is more effective.\n",

We present a case study of the online\nEPO program of The Dark Energy Survey, currently one of the largest\ninternational astronomy collaborations actively taking data. DES EPO is unique\nat this scale in astronomy, as far as we are aware, as it evolved organically\nfrom scientists' passion for EPO and is entirely organized and implemented by\nthe volunteer efforts of collaboration scientists. We summarize the strategy\nand implementation of eight EPO initiatives. For content distributed via social\nmedia, we present reach and user statistics over the 2016 calendar year. DES\nEPO online products reached ~2,500 users per post, and 94% of these users\nindicate a predisposition to science-related interests. We find no obvious\ncorrelation between post type and post reach, with the most popular posts\nfeaturing the intersections of science and art and/or popular culture. We\nconclude that one key issue of the online DES EPO program was designing\nmaterial which would inspire new interest in science. The greatest difficulty\nof the online DES EPO program was sustaining scientist participation and\ncollaboration support; the most successful programs are those which capitalized\non the hobbies of participating scientists.

The goal of the game is to guess a\nquantum state secretly chosen from a given set in the fewest number of\nmeasurements. It uses twenty-sided dice or other classical random number\ngenerators to simulate quantum measurements. The Bloch vector formalism is\nintroduced to give a geometric description of the quantum states and\nmeasurement outcomes. Several ready-to-use sets of quantum states are given, so\nreaders can jump right in and try the game themselves without any prior\nknowledge of quantum mechanics. More advanced students can also use the game in\nsuggested follow-up exercises to deepen students' understanding of quantum\nmeasurements and their statistical description.\n",

In 2017, physicists and\ntechnicians of the University of Mons in Belgium reproduced the experiment with\nmodern devices to allow members of the public to measure the speed of light\nthemselves. The light source used was a low power laser, and the cogwheel was\nreplaced by an electrically driven chopper, but the general spirit of Fizeau's\nexperiment was preserved.

The\nPIRATE teaching activities were studied as part of a wider research project\ninto the importance of realism, sociability and meta-functionality for the\neffectiveness of virtual and remote laboratories in teaching practical science.\nWe find that students accept virtual experiments (e.g. a telescope simulator)\nwhen they deliver genuine, 'messy' data, clarify how they differ from a\nrealistic portrayal, and are flagged as training tools. A robotic telescope is\naccepted in place of on-site practical work when realistic activities are\nincluded, the internet connection is stable, and when there is at least one\nlive video feed. The robotic telescope activity should include group work and\nfacilitate social modes of learning. Virtual experiments, though normally\nconsidered as asynchronous tools, should also include social interaction. To\nimprove student engagement and learning outcomes a greater situational\nawareness for the robotic telescope setting should be devised. We conclude this\nreport with a short account of the current status of PIRATE after its\nrelocation from Mallorca to Tenerife, and its integration into the OpenScience\nObservatories.\n",

An optical cloaking device (OCD) is an\nartifact that hides the object and, at the same time, its presence is not (or\nshould not be) noticeable for the observer, who will have the impression of\nbeing looking through it. At the level of paraxial geometrical optics, suitable\nfor undergraduate courses, simple OCDs can be built by combining a series of\nlenses. With this motivation, here we present an analysis of a simple\nprojective OCD arrangement. First, a simple theoretical account in terms of the\ntransfer matrix method is provided, and then the outcomes from a series of\nteaching experiments carried out with this device, easy to conduct in the\nclassroom, are discussed. In particular, the performance of such an OCD is\ninvestigated by determining the effect of the hidden object, role here played\nby the opaque zone of an iris-type diaphragm, on the projected image of an\nilluminated transparent slide (test object). That is, cloaking is analyzed in\nterms of the optimal position and opening diameter of a diaphragm that still\nwarrants an almost unaffected projected image. Because the lenses are not\nhigh-quality ones, the OCD is not aberration-free, which is advantageously\nconsidered to determine acceptable cloaking conditions (i.e., the tolerance of\nthe device).\n",

We derive equations of motion (EoMs) to physically parametrize the\nvertical motion of the seed and analytically solve to obtain the exact\nsolutions. Interestingly, we observe that our predicted solutions are in\nagreement with the experimental data. More precisely, the entire trajectory of\nthe falling seed of Yang-na can be described by our predicted solutions. We\nalso determine terminal velocity of the seeds. Remarkably, this work reasonably\nproves that seed dispersal characteristics of Yang-na is inherently straight\ndownward. Finally, we believe that our achievement will be valuable to the\nlarge community of STEM/STEAM education to promote an understanding in the\ntopic integrating mathematics, physics, biology, art and technology.

We introduce both\nanalytical and methodological changes to the study of confidence in science\nknowledge and in attitudes towards science and apply them to four large\nsurveys, spanning 30 years in Europe and the USA. We propose a new indirect\nconfidence metric that does not rely on self-reporting or peer comparison, and\nstudy how knowledge and confidence vary across their full scale. We find that\nconfidence grows much faster than knowledge, giving rise to a non-linear\nrelationship, with the largest confidence gaps appearing at intermediate\nknowledge levels. These high-confidence \\textbackslash intermediate-knowledge\ngroups also display the least positive attitudes towards science, with\nimportant consequences for science communication. These results are contrary to\ncurrent models, including the predictions of the Dunning-Kruger effect, and we\ndiscuss how our model, if correct, can guide future research and communication\npolicies.\n",

Given these well-established results, instructors\nof upper-division astronomy courses may decide to search the astronomy\neducation research literature in hopes of finding some guidance on common\nstudent difficulties, as well as research-validated and research-based active\nlearning curricula. But their search will be in vain. The current literature on\nupper-division astronomy is essentially non-existent.

Thus, it has great\npotential to shape students' attitudes toward STEM fields for the rest of their\nlife. We therefore argue that it is less important, when assessing the\neffectiveness of introductory astronomy courses, to explore traditional\ncurricular learning gains than to explore the effects that various course\ncomponents have on this attitude. We describe the results of our analysis of\nend-of-semester surveys returned by a total of 749 students in 2014-2015, at 10\ninstitutions that employed at least part of the introductory astronomy lecture\nand lab curriculum we first implemented at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2009. Surveys\nwere designed to measure each student's attitude, and to probe the correlation\nof attitude with their utilization of, and satisfaction with, various course\ncomponents, along with other measures of their academic background and their\nself-assessed performance in the course. We find that students' attitudes are\nsignificantly positively correlated with the grade they expect to receive, and\ntheir rating of the course's overall effectiveness. To a lesser degree, we find\nthat students' attitudes are positively correlated with their mathematical\nbackground, whether they intend to major or pursue a career in STEM, and their\nrating of the effectiveness of the instructor. We find that students' attitudes\nare negatively correlated with the amount of work they perceived the course to\ninvolve, and, surprisingly, the size and reputation of their home institution.\nWe also find that, for the subsets of students who were exposed to them,\nstudents' attitudes are positively correlated with their perception of the\nhelpfulness of the lecture component of the course, and of telescope-based labs\nthat utilized UNC-CH's Skynet Robotic Telescope Network.\n",

The mindset or forma mentis of 159\nItalian high school students and of 59 international researchers in STEM are\nreconstructed through forma mentis networks, i.e., cognitive networks of\nconcepts connected by free associations and enriched with sentiment labels. The\nlayout of conceptual associations between positively/negatively/neutrally\nperceived concepts is informative on how people build their own mental\nconstructs or beliefs about specific topics. Researchers displayed mixed\npositive/neutral mental representations of ``teacher'', ``student'' and,\n``scientist''. Students' conceptual associations of ``scientist'' were highly\npositive and largely non-stereotypical, although links about the ``mad\nscientist'' stereotype persisted. Students perceived ``teacher'' as a complex\nfigure, associated with positive aspects like mentoring/knowledge transmission\nbut also to negative sides revolving around testing and grading. ``School''\nelicited stronger differences between the two groups. In the students' mindset,\n``school'' was surrounded by a negative emotional aura or set of associations,\nindicating an anxious perception of the school setting, mixing scholastic\nconcepts, anxiety-eliciting words, STEM disciplines like maths and physics, and\nexam-related notions. Researchers' positive stance of ``school'' included\nconcepts of fun, friendship, and personal growth instead. Along the perspective\nof Education Research, the above results are discussed as quantitative evidence\nfor test- and STEM anxiety co-occurring in the way Italian students perceive\neducation places and their actors. Detecting these patterns in student\npopulations through forma mentis networks offers new, simple to gather yet\ndetailed knowledge for future data-informed intervention policies and action\nresearch.\n",

However, over the last years, the progress in\ndeveloping more cost-effective projectors has led to affordable spatial light\nmodulators in the form of so-called Digital Micromirror Devices (DMD). This\nreduction in price, as well as their simple usage, make such devices\nincreasingly suitable for undergraduate laboratories to demonstrate optical\neffects and the shaping of light fields.

Naturally, a\ncourse programme is structured in a networked form (temporal dependency and\nprerequisites). In this approach, each topic within each programme is\nassociated with a node, which in turn is joined by links representing the\ndependence of a topic for the understanding of another in a different\ndiscipline. As a course programme is a time-dependent structure, we propose a\nsimple model to assign links between nodes, taking into account only two\ningredients of the teaching-learning process: recursiveness and accumulation of\nknowledge. Since we already know the programmes, our objective is to verify if\nthe proposed model is able to capture their particularities and to identify\nimplications of different sequencing on the student learning in the early years\nof engineering degrees. Our model can be used as a systematic tool assisting\nthe construction of a more interdisciplinary curriculum, articulating between\ndisciplines of the undergraduate early-years in exact sciences.\n",

All four LHC\nexperiments participate in the event, including ALICE, the experiment optimised\nfor the study of heavy-ion collisions. Heavy-ion physics is actively\ncontributing to IMC with new developments including experimental measurements\nbut also applications for society, such as treatment of cancer with ions. In\nparticular, ALICE provides three MC measurements related to the main\nobservables used to characterize the properties of the produced Quark-Gluon\nPlasma. Historically, those MC measurements were developed independently,\ninheriting from the first one, by several ALICE groups. Since all of them are\nbased on the ROOT EVE package, a project to integrate them into a common\nframework was undertaken. ALICE delivers now a single and easy-to-use\napplication, compiled under Linux, MacOS, and, for the first time, Windows.\nThen, in line with current IPPOG goals to increase the global reach and scope\nof the IMC programme a newly developed measurement on medical applications of\nparticle physics, the Particle Therapy MasterClass (PTMC) was introduced in the\nIMC2020 programme. It is a simplified version of matRad, a MATLAB-based toolkit\nfor calculation of dose deposition in the body and allows for planning of\nradiotherapy using different modalities and highlighting the benefits of\ntreatment with ions.\n",

It includes the 6-day Space School UK and the\n8-day Senior Space School UK (collectively SSUK) which are for 13-15 and 16-18\nyear olds respectively. This paper seeks to evaluate and present the benefits\nof SSUK to individuals who participate in the programme, organisations involved\nin the running of SSUK, and to highlight and promote these benefits to the\nwider UK and global space community. We also address which facets of SSUK make\nfor such an engaging and encouraging experience for the students, that are\nmissing from students' traditional education. We seek to show how SSUK acts as\nan excellent example of how to bridge the gap between secondary and tertiary\nspace education.

In this article, we present this\nteaching method through a particular project that took place in the autumn\nsemester 2019: the ping-pong ball water cannon. In this experiment, a glass\ncontaining water and a floating table tennis ball is dropped from some height\nto the ground. Following the impact, the ball is ejected vertically upwards at\nspeeds that can be several times the impact speed. We report the student team's\ninitial dimensional and order-of-magnitude analysis, and describe the\nsuccessive experimental setups that showed (1) that free flight is essential\nfor the phenomenon to occur, (2) that the order of magnitude of the ball\nejection momentum is correctly predicted by a momentum balance based on\nintegrating the pressure impulse during impact and (3) that making the ball\nsurface more wettable, or stirring the liquid, drastically increases the\nmomentum transfer. The proposed explanation, confirmed by direct high-speed\nvideo observations, is that the immersion depth of the ball increases during\nfree fall due to capillary forces or vortex depression-in the absence of\nbuoyancy-and that the enormous excess pressure on the bottom of the ball during\nimpact drives the ball up towards its buoyancy equilibrium. The transfered\nmomentum is sufficient to expel the ball at high velocity, very similar to the\nformation of liquid jets in collapsing cavities in liquids.\n",

That approach allows students to investigate the\nimplications of new model parameters in a systematic way. Students fit the\nresulting models to reported cases-per-day data for the United States using\nleast-squares techniques with Excel's Solver. Using their own spreadsheets,\nstudents discover for themselves that the initial exponential growth of\nCOVID-19 can be explained by a simplified unlimited growth model and by the SIR\nmodel. They also discover that the effects of social distancing can be modeled\nusing a Gaussian transition function for the infection rate coefficient and\nthat the summer surge was caused by prematurely relaxing social distancing and\nthen reimposing stricter social distancing. Students then model the effect of\nvaccinations and validate the resulting SIRV model by showing that it\nsuccessfully predicts the reported cases-per-day data from Thanksgiving through\nFebruary 14, 2021. The same SIRV model is then extended and successfully fits\nthe fourth peak up to June 1, 2021, caused by further relaxation of social\ndistancing measures. Finally, students extend the model up to the present day\nand successfully account for the appearance of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe fitted model also predicts that the delta-variant peak will be\ncomparatively short, and the cases-per-day data should begin to fall off in\nearly September 2021 - counter to current expectations.

The internet\nand social media have also empowered citizen science such that the deficiencies\nin the legacy physics education around flight and lift are well known. The\nlong-standing equal transit time (ETT) theory to explain lift has been proven\nfalse. If incorrect, why was it ever taught? Through a historical analysis of\nrelevant fluid and aerodynamics literature, this study attempts to explain why\nETT theory is part of our collectively lower-level cognitive understanding of\nlift and flight. It was found that in 1744 D'Alembert himself assumed this to\nbe a feature of moving fluids, and while this initial intuition (ETT 1.0) was\nincorrect, the property of ETT (ETT 2.0) was derived in 1752 when applying\nNewton's laws of motion to fluids. This incorrect result was independently\nconfirmed in 1757 by Euler! The conclusion is that an over simplified treatment\nof fluids predicts ETT, along with no lift and drag. This then leads to the\nopen question, can ETT be taught at an appropriately low level as an\nexplanation for lift?\n",

Then, students measure the pump-probe\nreflectivity of a single-crystal antimony sample to determine the period of\ncoherent phonon oscillations initiated by an ultrafast pulse excitation, which\nis analyzed by fitting to a sine wave.

In this work, we sketch the\nStellector design and its mode of operation. We also illustrate some teaching\nactivities involving basic night sky observations and astronomy concepts.\nFinally, we discuss the device limitations, its accuracy and further\nimprovements.\n",

Next, we outline the NE290\nsyllabus in terms of assignments and an overview of course content in the form\nof a class timeline. We provide an extensive description of the materials and\nteaching methodologies for the four units of NE290: 20th-Century Physics,\nPhysics in WWII, the Early Cold War, and the Late Cold War and Modern Era. We\ndetail the sequence of lectures across the course and historical timelines --\nleading up to a showcasing of NE290 final projects which mirror in creativity\nthe novelty of course offering. Because NE290 was first offered during Spring\n2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional measures in the form of new tools\nwere used to augment the mandate of remote learning such as videoconferencing\ntechnology to recruit geographically diverse guest lecturers, and used the MIRO\ntool for virtual whiteboarding.

However, science as experienced\nin school settings typically emphasizes an overly objective and rationalistic\nview. In this paper, we argue for focusing on the development of disciplined\ninterpretation as an epistemic and representational practice that progressively\ndeepens students' computational modeling in science by valuing, rather than\ndeemphasizing, the subjective nature of the experience of modeling. We report\nresults from a study in which fourth grade children engaged in computational\nmodeling throughout the academic year. We present three salient themes that\ncharacterize the development of students' disciplined interpretations in terms\nof their development of computational modeling as a way of seeing and doing\nscience.\n",

The aim was to perform\na qualitative study about the relationship between the research behaviour of\nastronomers and how their science is being evaluated. This study encompassed\nthe funding and publication system as well as the indicators used to measure\nthe scientific output, its quality and the research performance. This report\nsheds light on how astronomers define high-quality research and how they think\nthat creating knowledge of value is encouraged or hampered by the evaluation\nprocesses. We found that astronomers are realists who define scientific quality\non the basis of \"truth\" and are driven by curiosity. These two factors make up\ntheir intrinsic values and motivation to perform Astronomy. Publication\npressure, arising from the requirements of \"the system\", creates an extrinsic\nmotivation to perform. This results in premature publications, low readability\nand replicability, risk aversion and a focus on quantity rather than quality.\nHence, indicators do not merely represent quality, but also co-constitute what\ncounts as good research. While we observe such constitutive effects of\nindicator use on research behaviour and content, we do not see that the\nastronomer's intrinsic values are co-constituted. This gives rise to a\ndiscrepancy between what is being measured by indicators and what astronomers\ndefine as scientific quality; the so-called \"evaluation gap\". Findings on\nconstitutive effects and the evaluation gap in Astronomy lays out the\nconceptual groundwork for further empirical research and for policy advice on\nalternative evaluation practices and innovative indicators with the aim of\nbridging the \"evaluation gap\".\n",

We\ntested the effects of four major concepts on attrition from physics and\nastronomy. These concepts included: the imposter syndrome, mentoring and\nadvising during graduate school, the so-called \"two-body problem\" that occurs\nwhen a couple needs to find two jobs in the same geographic area, and gender of\nthe respondent. Having a mentor in grad school did not contribute to working\noutside of physics or astronomy.

Encouragement of the graduate advisor, the two-body problem, and\ncompleting a postdoc, had significant direct effects on working in physics or\nastronomy.

Few fields explicitly teach students the skills to analyze\ndatasets, and yet the increasing push for authentic science implies these\nskills should be taught.\n  Purpose: The overarching motivation is to understand learning of dataset\nskills within an astronomy context. Specifically, when participants work with a\n200-entry Google Sheets dataset of astronomical data about quasars, what are\nthey learning, how are they learning it, and who is doing the learning?\n  Sample: The authors studied a matched set of participants (n=87) consisting\nof 54 university undergraduate students (34 male, 18 female), and 33 science\neducators (16 male, 17 female).\n  Design and methods: Participants explored a three-phase dataset activity and\nwere given an eight-question multiple-choice pre/post-test covering skills of\nanalyzing datasets and astronomy content, with questions spanning Bloom's\nTaxonomy. Pre/post-test scores were compared and a t-test performed for\nsubsamples by population.\n  Results: Participants exhibited learning of both dataset skills and astronomy\ncontent, indicating that dataset skills can be learned through this astronomy\nactivity. Participants exhibited gains in both recall and synthesis questions,\nindicating learning is non-sequential. Female undergraduate students exhibited\nlower levels of learning than other populations.\n  Conclusions: Implications of the study include a stronger dataset focus in\npost-secondary STEM education and among science educators, and the need for\nfurther investigation into how instructors can ameliorate the challenges faced\nby female undergraduate students.\n",

We present a novel method of impact evaluation which integrates\ngraffiti walls into the experience both before and after the main drop-in\nactivity. The activity in question was a soundscape exhibit, where young\nfamilies experienced the usually inaudible sounds of near-Earth space in an\nimmersive and accessible way. We apply two analysis techniques to the captured\nbefore and after data - quantitative linguistics and thematic analysis. These\nanalyses reveal significant changes in participants' responses after the\nactivity compared to before, namely an increased diversity in language used to\ndescribe space and altered conceptions of what space is like. The results\ndemonstrate that the soundscape was surprisingly effective at innately\ncommunicating key aspects of the underlying science simply through the act of\nlistening. The impacts also highlight the power of sonification in stimulating\npublic engagement, which, through reflection, can lead to altered associations,\nperceptions, and understanding. Therefore, we show that this novel approach to\ndrop-in activity evaluation, using graffiti walls both before and after the\nactivity and applying rigorous analysis to this data, has the power to capture\nchange and, thus, have a short-term impact. We suggest that commonly used\nevaluation tools suitable for drop-in activities, such as graffiti walls,\nshould be integrated both before and after the main activity in general, rather\nthan only using them afterwards as is typically the case.\n",

Quantum Odyssey is a new\npiece of computer software that promises to be a medium where people can learn\nquantum computing without any previous requirements. It aims to achieve this\nthrough visual cues and puzzle play, without requiring the user to possess a\nbackground in computer coding or even linear algebra, which are traditionally a\nmust to work on quantum algorithms. In this paper we report our findings on an\nUKRI Citizen Science grant that involves using Quantum Odyssey to teach how to\nconstruct quantum computing algorithms. Sessions involved 30 minutes of play,\nwith 10 groups of 5 students, ranging between 11 to 18 years old, in two\nschools in the UK. Results show the Quantum Odyssey visual methods are\nefficient in portraying counterintuitive quantum computational logic in a\nvisual and interactive form. This enabled untrained participants to quickly\ngrasp difficult concepts in an intuitive way and solve problems that are\ntraditionally given today in Masters level courses in a mathematical form. The\nresults also show an increased interest in quantum physics after play, a higher\nopenness and curiosity to learn the mathematics behind computing on quantum\nsystems.

Thus, physics educators\nare left to their own devices as to how to introduce this important concept.\nRegardless of how a physics educator chooses to introduce quantum entanglement,\nthey face a trilemma involving its mysterious Bell-inequality-violating\ncorrelations. They can compromise on the the completeness of their introduction\nand simply choose not to share that fact, totally ignoring the 2022 Nobel Prize\nin Physics. They can frustrate their more curious students by introducing the\nmystery and simply telling them that the QM formalism with its associated\n(equally mysterious) conservation law maps beautifully to the experiments, so\nthere is nothing else that needs to be said. Or, they can compromise the rigor\nof their presentation and attempt to resolve the mystery by venturing into the\nmetaphysical quagmire of competing QM interpretations. Herein, we resolve this\ntrilemma in precisely the same way that Einstein resolved the mysteries of time\ndilation and length contraction that existed in the late nineteenth century.\nThat is, we resort to \"principle\" explanation based on the mathematical\nconsequences of \"empirically discovered\" facts. Indeed, our principle account\nof quantum entanglement is even based on the same principle Einstein used,\ni.e., the relativity principle or \"no preferred reference frame.\" Thus, this\nprinciple resolution of the trilemma is as complete, satisfying, analytically\nrigorous, and accessible as the standard introduction of special relativity for\nfirst-year physics students.\n",

The answer is simple, since modern physics is in general not present\nin the standard physics curricula, except for some general outlines, in the\nfinal years of some secondary schools. But, is it possibile to teach modern\nphysics in primary school? Is it effective? And, also, is it engaging for\nstudents? These are the simple questions which stimulated our research, based\non an intervention performed in the last year of Italian primary school,\nfocused on teaching gravity, according to the Einsteinian approach in the\nspirit of the Einstein First project, an international collaboration which aims\nto teach school age children the concepts of modern physics. The outcomes of\nour research study are in agreement with previous findings obtained in\nAustralian schools, thus they contribute to validate them and show that there\nis no cultural effect, since the approach works in different education systems.\nFinally, our results are relevant also in terms of retention and prove that the\nstudents involved really understand the key ideas.\n",

With the emergence of this new\nquantum industry, a new workforce trained in QIST skills and knowledge is\nneeded. To help support education and training of this workforce, universities\nand colleges require knowledge of the type of jobs available for their students\nand what skills and degrees are most relevant for those new jobs. Additionally,\nstudents need to know how to tailor their degrees to best align with the\ncurrent needs of the quantum industry. We report on the results from a survey\nof 57 companies in the quantum industry, with the goal of elucidating the jobs,\nskills, and degrees that are relevant for this new workforce. We find a range\nof job opportunities from highly specific jobs, such as quantum algorithm\ndeveloper and error correction scientist, to broader jobs categories within the\nbusiness, software, and hardware sectors. These broader jobs require a range of\nskills, most of which are not quantum related. Further, except for the highly\nspecific jobs, companies that responded to the survey are looking for a range\nof degree levels to fill these new positions, from bachelors to masters to\nPhDs. With this knowledge, students, instructors, and university administrators\ncan make informed decisions about how to address the challenge of increasing\nthe future quantum workforce.\n",

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of student collaboration\ndepends on the extent that these interactions take place under conditions that\nfavor commitment, trust, and decision-making among those who interact. The\nsanitary situation and the transition to remote teaching has added new\nchallenges for collaboration given that students' interactions are mediated by\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs). In this study we explore the\neffectiveness of different collaborative relationships on physics and\nmathematics, from a sample of secondary students from two schools located in\nrural and urban areas in southern Chile. We used Social Network Analysis (SNA)\nto map students' friendships relations, academic prestige, and collaboration on\nboth courses. Later we combined the collaboration network with friendship and\nacademic prestige on the course, to separate strong from weak friendship\nworking ties, and those among students who enjoy or not academic prestige.\nMultiple linear regression models showed, on average, positive effects of\ncollaboration on grades. Yet, when isolating the effects of the types of\ncollaboration, the positive effects are observed only between those who display\nmore strong friendship ties. Also, we found differences on the social networks\nand their effects over grades between both courses, presumably due to their\npedagogical nature. With these results we contribute to the literature of\ncollaboration and its effectiveness based on the nature of students'\nrelationships, and advocate for the importance of instructional design in\nfostering appropriate motivations and guidelines for constructive collaboration\nin the classroom.\n",

We also find that while course\ntopics are ostensibly similar, each course is crafted by its instructor to tell\na different story about QIS and to uniquely balance goals such as accessibility\nand academic rigor, such that no canonical introduction to QIS course emerges\nfrom our dataset.

In this\nforced and sudden transition, teachers and students did not have the\nopportunity to acquire the knowledge or skills necessary for online learning\nmodalities implemented through a learning management system (LMS). Therefore,\nundergraduate teachers tend to mainly use an LMS as an information repository\nand rarely promote virtual interactions among students, thus limiting the\nbenefits of collective intelligence for students. We analyzed data on 7,528\nundergraduate students and found that cooperative and consensus dynamics among\nuniversity students in discussion forums positively affect their final GPA,\nwith a steeper effect for students with low academic performance during high\nschool. These results hold above and beyond socioeconomic and other LMS\nactivity confounders. Furthermore, using natural language processing, we show\nthat first-year students with low academic performance during high school are\nexposed to more content-intensive posts in discussion forums, leading to\nsignificantly higher university GPAs than their low-performance peers in high\nschool. We expect these results to motivate higher education teachers worldwide\nto promote cooperative and consensus dynamics among students using tools such\nas forum discussions in their classes to reap the benefits of social learning\nand collective intelligence.\n",

Augmented Reality is now widely used in the\neducation sector at level K to 12. AR is expected to be generally adopted in\ntwo to three years in higher education and four to five years in K to 12.\nApplying AR technology in the education sector especially in STEM subjects, can\nresult in having a smart campus. In adopting a SMART Campus strategy, education\npractitioners must address many intrinsic issues in science, technology,\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) research. For example, in physics, there\nare expensive or insufficient laboratory systems, system faults, and difficulty\nsimulating other experimental circumstances. In technology, many schools do not\nhave enough computers. In engineering, there are only a few instructors who are\nknowledgeable in computer aided design (CAD). In mathematics, few teachers\nincorporate technology into their lessons often because they believe it is\nstill better to teach through the traditional methods. Hence, In this paper we\ndiscuss how AR is being used now in different learning areas in STEM to open\nnew doors to researchers and teachers as they transition their schools into\nSMART campuses with the use of AR apps. Aligned with this, a suggested\nframework for school administrators and policymakers is proposed based on a\nreview of the positive benefits of different AR apps.\n",

As\nnew tools become available, new theories are developed, and physicists search\nfor new answers with ever-evolving methods.

Graduate school (and undergraduate school to a lesser extent) is\nwhere researchers learn most of the technical skills required for research,\ndevelop scientific problem-solving abilities, learn how to establish themselves\nin their field, and begin developing their career. It is unfortunate, then,\nthat the skills gained by physicists during their formal education are often\nmismatched with the skills actually required for a successful career in\nphysics. We performed a survey of the U.S. particle physics community to\ndetermine the missing elements of graduate and undergraduate education and to\ngauge how to bridge these gaps. In this contributed paper, part of the 2021-22\nSnowmass Community Planning Exercise, we report the results of this survey.

Reliability testing showed that factor 1 had a Cronbachs alpha of\n0.901 and factor 2 had a Cronbachs alpha of 0.937. Construct validity was\nestablished by computing one way analyses of variances, with the p value\nsuitably protected, using independent variables peripherally related to the\nconstructs. These analyses demonstrate that both scales possess high construct\nvalidity. The development of this astronomy specific instrument is an important\nstep in evaluating self efficacy as a precursor to investigating the construct\nof science identity in the field of astronomy.\n",

We discuss the role of the repetitions and samples\nto minimize the experimental uncertainty, and by using the averaged value of\nthe period, we compute the gravitational acceleration locally. Also, we present\nthe corrections due to the moment of inertia of the system. Finally, by taking\ninto account the geographical location of each pendulum, we report gravity's\ndependence on latitude, longitude, and altitude by discussing the implications\non the Earth's shape.

In this work, we describe an\ninexpensive experimental setup for the quantitative measurement of\nbirefringence in common household films, suitable for senior high school or\nundergraduate labs. Whereas traditional approaches for polarization-based\nclassroom experiments typically use monochromatic laser light, we encourage the\ncombined use of an incoherent incandescent light source and portable\nspectrometer. In addition, we demonstrate how any concomitant thin-film\ninterference effects can be used to separately measure the optical thickness in\nthe most heterogeneous and uniform films. Such measurement can then be used as\nan independent experimental confirmation of either the film's index of\nrefraction or its thickness, given knowledge of the other. In an effort to\nprovide examples for the data analysis procedures as well as to investigate a\nrange of materials, we measure the birefringence across the visible spectrum of\nsix common household polymer films, including thin kitchen wrap, cellophane,\ngift basket film, and common adhesive tapes.\n",

So, nowadays,\nthin film coatings are routinely deposited on very different kinds of\nsubstrates. From the beginning, the use of thin films required the optical\ncharacterization of the coating materials as well as the design of the suitable\nthin film structures in order to meet the optical requirements. This has been a\nsignificant research topic in the past but the impact of high level programming\nlanguages has dramatically changed the scenario. Nowadays, to address the more\nadvanced computation tasks related to thin film technology is much simple. The\naim of the Tutorial presented here is to enable the reader (with only a basic\nknowledge of the use of Matlab or Python) to perform advanced numerical\ncomputations of the optical properties of thin film structures. We will explain\nthe necessary steps and supply the corresponding program codes, with complete\ncomments.

These barriers include\nlack of research infrastructure and opportunities, insufficient mentoring, lack\nof support networks, and financial hardship, among many others. Recently the\nU.S. CMS Collaboration launched a pilot program U.S. CMS - PURSUE (Program for\nUndergraduate Research SUmmer Experience) to address these barriers. A 10-week\npaid internship program, the very first of its kind in an HEP experiment, was\norganised during the summer of 2022. Students were selected predominantly from\nMinority Serving Institutions with no research program in HEP. This pilot\nprogram provided a structured hands-on research experience under the\nmentor-ship of U.S. CMS scientists from several collaborating institutions. In\naddition to emphasis on hands-on research, the program offered a set of\nsoftware training modules for the first few weeks. These were interleaved with\na series of lectures every week covering a broad range of topics. The students\nwere exposed to cutting-edge particle physics research and developed a broad\nset of skills in software, computing, data science, and machine learning. The\nmodality of this program was virtual, due to the unknown circumstances\nfollowing the pandemic. There is plan to continue the internship program\nannually, with in-person training and research participation.

White men dominate most STEM fields and are particularly\noverrepresented in positions of status and influence (i.e. full professors,\nchairs, deans, etc.), positioning them as a potentially powerful demographic\nfor enacting systemic reform. Despite their proclaimed outrage at and interest\nin addressing inequity, they frequently engage in patterns of belief, speech\nand (in)action that ultimately support the status quo of white male privilege\nin opposition to their intentions.\n  Results: The white male physicists we interviewed used numerous discourses\nwhich support racist and sexist norms and position them as powerless to disrupt\ntheir own privilege. We present and discuss three overarching themes, seen in\nour data, demonstrating how highly intelligent, well-intentioned people of\nprivilege maintain their power and privilege despite their own intentions: 1)\nDenying inequity is physically near them, 2) Locating causes of inequity in\nlarge societal systems over which they have little influence and 3) Justifying\ninaction.\n  Conclusions: Despite being progressively minded, well-meaning, and highly\nintelligent, these men are frequently complicit in racism and sexism in\nphysics.

We show how our approach\ndrives the derivation of design principles, how these principles guide the\ndevelopment of the instructional sequence and of its strategies, how their\nimplementation requires the blending of different research perspectives and\nlearning systems. The first challenge is addressed through a path of revision\nof classical concepts and constructs which leverages prior knowledge according\nto the dynamics of each notion in theory change. The second by adopting a\nframework that promotes the construction of a unifying picture of quantum\nmeasurement across contexts. The third by designing the course around a\nmodelling process that engages students in epistemic practices of the\ntheoretical physicist, such as generating and/or running thought experiments,\nand mathematical modelling in a purely theoretical setting. All is aimed to\nhelp students accept the quantum description of the world as a plausible\nproduct of their own inquiry. This process is assisted by the discussion of the\nfacets of the foundational debate that are triggered by each of the suggested\ninterpretive choices, with the goal to promote an awareness of its cultural\nsignificance, of the limits the chosen stance, of the open issues. Data on the\ncycles of refinement illustrate how a set of activities have been made\neffective in addressing the challenges at a local level.\n",

It is also well-understood\nthat students enter the physics classroom with a host of conceptions learned\nfrom the world at large. It stands to reason, then, to suspect that media\ncoverage may be a major contributing factor to students' views on physical\nphenomena and the nature of science - one whose influence will only grow amid\nthe 21st century digital age. Yet the role of the media in shaping physics\nteaching and learning has remained largely unexplored in the physics education\nresearch (PER) literature so far.\n  Here, we explore the phenomenon of media hype from a theoretical and\npractical perspective: how media rhetoric of current topics in science and\ntechnology evolves, and how it affects students and instructors. We argue that\nmedia hype of cutting-edge science can be a double-edged sword for educators,\nwith the same amped-up rhetoric that motivates students to enter the classroom\ntending to result in inflated preconceptions of what the science and technology\ncan actually do. We draw on examples related to teaching quantum computing as a\ncase study, though the findings we present should generalize to other topics\ngarnering significant media attention - from exoplanets to graphene to\nbatteries for electric vehicles. We conclude with a set of practical\nrecommendations for physics teachers at all levels who wish to be more\ncognizant of the role exposure to popular media has on students and to tailor\nour teaching accordingly.\n",

These apparent abilities have prompted discussion of ChatGPT as\nboth a threat to the integrity of higher education and conversely as a powerful\nteaching tool. In this work we present a preliminary analysis of how two\nversions of ChatGPT (ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4) fare in the field of\nfirst-semester university physics, using a modified version of the Force\nConcept Inventory (FCI) to assess whether it can give correct responses to\nconceptual physics questions about kinematics and Newtonian dynamics.

        "summary": "  \"Q Zhang's Problem\" is a teaching problem proposed by Qian Zhang, a science\nteacher at Dongjiao Minxiang Primary School in Dongcheng District, Beijing. In\n2022, she proposed that: (1) when explaining the knowledge points of frequency\nin the \"Sound\" unit, experiments on the vibration of objects such as rubber\nbands and steel rulers were used to assist students in learning, but the effect\nwas not obvious, because it was difficult for the naked eye to distinguish the\nspeed of vibration of objects such as rubber bands, and it was difficult to\ncorrespond to the high and low frequencies; (2) Students seem to be confused\nabout the difference between frequency and amplitude. When guiding them to make\nthe rubber band vibrate faster, they tend to tug harder at the rubber band, but\nthis actually changes the amplitude rather than the frequency (changing the\nfrequency should be to control its vibrating chord length, similar to the\ntuning method of a stringed instrument). Therefore, demonstration experiments\nusing objects such as rubber bands as frequencies do not seem suitable and\ncannot effectively assist students in establishing the concept of frequency. We\nhope to solicit opinions and solutions (research ideas) on this problem, with a\nfocus on two points: (1) the mathematical/physical explanation of the problem.\nThat is, does simply changing the amplitude really not affect the original\nvibration frequency of the object (except when the amplitude is 0) (2)\nexplanation from a cognitive perspective: Why do people confuse the two\nconcepts? What is the cognitive mechanism behind it.\n",

They are often described as \"objects\nthat do not come back to their initial state after one turn but do after two\nturns\". There are macroscopic implementations using constraints such as\nclamping a belt or ribbon that purport to show similar behavior (the \"Dirac\nbelt trick\"). However, a demonstration of an unconstrained macroscopic object\nwith half-spin behavior remains elusive. In this article, we propose to fill\nthis gap and introduce the spinorial ball. It consists of a translucent plastic\nball with internal LED illumination that behaves as a freely movable\nmacroscopic half-spin object. It provides a new tool to introduce and visualize\nhalf-integer spins as well as the covering group homomorphism from SU(2) to\nSO(3), and offers in particular a clear visualization of the different homotopy\nclasses of SO(3). We discuss its development and function, and how one can\nmimic quantum measurement and wave function collapse using this the spinorial\nball. The entire system is open source hardware, with build details, models, 3d\nprinting files, etc., provided under an open source license.\n",

This leads to a differential\nequation perspective for teaching the material. However, we know that abstract\nrepresentation-independent approaches often work better with students, by\ncomparing student reactions to learning the series solution of the harmonic\noscillator versus the abstract operator method. Because one can teach all of\nthe solvable quantum problems using a similar abstract method, it brings up the\nquestion, which is likely to lead to a better student understanding? In work at\nGeorgetown University and with edX, we have been teaching a class focused on an\noperator-forward viewpoint, which we like to call operator mechanics. It\nteaches quantum mechanics in a representation-independent fashion and allows\nfor most of the math to be algebraic, rather than based on differential\nequations. It relies on four fundamental operator identities -- (i) the Leibniz\nrule for commutators; (ii) the Hadamard lemma; (iii) the\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula; and (iv) the exponential disentangling\nidentity. These identities allow one to solve eigenvalues, eigenstates and\nwavefunctions for all analytically solvable problems (including some not often\nincluded in undergraduate curricula, such as the Morse potential or the\nPoschl-Teller potential). It also allows for more advanced concepts relevant\nfor quantum sensing, such as squeezed states, to be introduced in a simpler\nformat than is conventionally done.

We then\nemploy hierarchical linear modelling to quantify the interaction effects\nbetween gender and other demographics, providing a detailed perspective on the\non continuation in physics. Our results indicate the racial demographics of a\nschool's neighbourhood have a limited impact on continuation once controlling\nfor other factors such as socioeconomic status, though neighbourhoods with a\nhigher Black population were a notable exception, consistently exhibiting\nsignificantly lower continuation rates for both male and female students. A\npotential role model effect related to parental education was also found as the\nproportion of parents with STEM degrees correlates positively with increased\ncontinuation, whereas an increase in non-STEM degrees corresponds with a\nreduced SCR. The most pronounced effects are school-level factors. Continuation\nrates in physics are very strongly correlated with continuation in chemistry or\ncalculus - effects which are much stronger for male than female students.\nConversely, continuation in biology positively correlates with the continuation\nof female students in physics, with little to no effect found for male\nstudents. Nevertheless, the effect sizes observed for chemistry and calculus\nmarkedly outweigh that for biology. This is further evidence that considering\nSTEM as a homogeneous subject when examining gender disparities is misguided.\nThese insights can guide future education policies and initiatives to increase\ncontinuation rates and foster greater gender equity in physics education.\n",

Since the\nnet force acting on the system is zero while the system is stationary and\nmoving with a constant speed, in these cases the magnitudes of force read\nthrough the sensor are equal to the static and kinetic friction forces acting\non the object. Using these static and kinetic friction forces values, the\nmaximum value of the static friction coefficient and the kinetic friction\ncoefficient were calculated as 0.484 and 0.313, respectively.\n",

Understanding the\nfactors that lead to student success and attrition is crucial for improving\nthese programs. One factor that has recently started to be investigated is the\nbroadly defined students' experiences related to support structures. The\nAspects of Student Experience Scale (ASES), a Likert-style survey, was\ndeveloped by researchers to do just that. In this study, we leverage the\nnetwork approach for Likert-style surveys (NALS) methodology to provide a\nunique interpretation of responses to the ASES instrument for well-defined\ndemographic groups. We confirm the validity of our findings by studying the\nstability of the NALS themes and investigating how they are expressed within\ndemographic-based networks. We find that for all four themes in the original\nASES study, certain thematic trends capturing students' experiences vary across\nthe demographic-based networks in meaningful ways. We also reveal that for some\ndemographic groups, there is an interesting interplay between, and mixing of,\nthe original themes. Finally, our study showcases how NALS can be applied to\nother Likert-style datasets.\n",

        "summary": "  Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field encompassing various\ndisciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer engineering, and computer\nscience. Teaching quantum computing in a concise and effective manner can be\nchallenging, especially within the time constraints of a single course or a\nshort period, even for graduate students. This challenge is particularly\nrelevant in two-year MSc programs that include a thesis, which is a typical\nstructure in higher education systems in the USA and Europe. In this paper, the\nauthor proposes an approach to teaching quantum computing and shares their\nexperience of conducting a course chapter on the subject within a two-week time\nframe. The experience reported in this paper is integrated into the\n\"Technologies of Computing Systems\" (TCS) course, with a total workload of 6\nECTS (in the context of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System,\none ECTS corresponds to 28 hours of work), conducted in one quarter, over seven\nweeks. The structure of the course chapter is discussed, involving a series of\nlectures that were accompanied by lab classes and a lab project, allowing\nstudents to receive guidance while also engaging in hands-on learning and\nindependent study. The paper provides an overview of the quantum computing\ntopics covered, and their integration in the TSC course, and gives details\nabout how these topics are studied in the different types of classes. It also\ndiscusses the evaluation procedure and presents the results obtained. It can be\nconcluded that the inclusion of the quantum computing component not only\nsignificantly increased student interest in the course but also effectively\nbridged the gap between classical and quantum computing for engineering\nstudents within a short period of two weeks.\n",

One crucial aspect of our study is on the\nimplementation of an exciting algorithmic framework designed specifically to\noptimize the integration of visual and narrative components in an integrated\nway.

Yet, it is Newtonian gravity, a 350\nyear old formalism proven to be less accurate than relativity, which is taught\nin schools. It has been shown that Einsteinian gravitational concepts can be\nwell understood by students in both primary and secondary education. In this\npaper, a cross-section of students from Yr 7-13 enrolled in an English\nsecondary school took part in an intervention designed to introduce the idea of\ngravity from spacetime curvature. The overall aim of this work is to assess the\nviability of including relativity in the secondary curriculum and to ascertain\nwhich year this material would be best placed in. We determine that all year\ngroups where able to appreciate the effects of curvature to some extent. Visual\ndemonstrations aided conceptual understanding at Yr 7-8 level, but this does\nnot have a strong effect on their ideas around the source of the gravitational\nforce. Participants in Yr 9-13 were able to understand concepts beyond those\nintroduced in the demonstrations. However, a deeper understanding of curvature\nas the source of the gravitational force is not seen until years 12 & 13. We\nfind that those in Yr 13 have the best overall understanding of the concepts\nintroduced during our intervention.\n",

We\nfirst introduce an efficient procedure for creating large numbers of isomorphic\nphysics problems, assisted by the large language model GPT-3 and several other\nopen-source tools. We then propose that if exam items are randomly drawn from\nlarge enough problem banks, then giving students open access to problem banks\nprior to the exam will not dramatically impact students' performance on the\nexam or lead to wide-spread rote-memorization of solutions. We tested this\nhypothesis on two mid-term physics exams, comparing students' performance on\nproblems drawn from open isomorphic problem banks to similar transfer problems\nthat were not accessible to students prior to the exam. We found that on both\nexams, both open bank and transfer problems had the highest difficulty. The\ndifferences in percent correct were between 5% to 10%, which is comparable to\nthe differences between different isomorphic versions of the same problem type.\nItem response theory analysis found that both types of problem have high\ndiscrimination (>1.5) with no significant differences. Student performance on\nopen-bank and transfer problems are highly correlated with each other, and the\ncorrelations are stronger than average correlations between problems on the\nexam. Exploratory factor analysis also found that open-bank and transfer\nproblems load on the same factor, and even formed their own factor on the\nsecond exam. Those observations all suggest that giving students open access to\nlarge isomorphic problem banks only had a small impact on students' performance\non the exam but could have significant potential in reforming traditional\nclassroom exams.\n",

Python and Jupyter are becoming increasingly\npopular in this context, with Jupyter widgets at the core of the interactive\nfunctionalities. However, while packages and libraries which offer a broad\nrange of general-purpose widgets exist, there is limited development of\nspecialized widgets for computational physics, chemistry and materials science.\nThis deficiency implies significant time investments for the development of\neffective Jupyter notebooks for research and education in these domains. Here,\nwe present custom Jupyter widgets that we have developed to target the needs of\nthese communities. These widgets constitute high-quality interactive graphical\ncomponents and can be employed, for example, to visualize and manipulate data,\nor to explore different visual representations of concepts, clarifying the\nrelationships existing between them. In addition, we discuss with one example\nhow similar functionality can be exposed in the form of JupyterLab extensions,\nmodifying the JupyterLab interface for an enhanced user experience when working\nwith applications within the targeted scientific domains.\n",

These students traditionally face several barriers including\nlack of research infrastructure and opportunities, insufficient mentoring, lack\nof support networks, and financial hardship, among many others, resulting in a\nlack of participation in STEM fields. We had recently reported about a fully\nvirtual 10-week internship pilot program called \"U.S. CMS - PURSUE (Program for\nUndergraduate Research SUmmer Experience)\" to address dismantling such\nbarriers. The 2023 iteration of this program builds on it by imparting not only\nan in-person summer internship experience but extends it into the academic\nsemester as well. Students are selected predominantly from Minority Serving\nInstitutions with no research program in HEP and from under-represented groups.\nThey experience a structured hands-on research experience with an initial\ntwo-week \"bootcamp\" on software training modules followed by an 8-week HEP\nproject targeting physics analysis, software, computing or instrumentation work\non the CMS Experiment. A subset of interns continue the experience into the\nacademic semester, enabling a further in-depth knowledge of the field and a\nmotivation to persist in STEM areas. In this paper, we describe our recent\nexperience with this upgraded internship program. The paper is dedicated to the\nmemory of Prof. Meenakshi Narain (Brown University) who was the driving force\nbehind this internship program and U.S CMS diversity, equity and inclusion\nefforts.\n",

One in four\nrespondents from BIPOC gender diverse backgrounds identified as being disabled,\nand the proportion of sexually diverse students who reported having a\ndisability was more than three times higher than the proportion of heterosexual\nstudents with a disability.

This approach diverges from traditional\nmethods by building upon foundational concepts in classical computing before\ngradually introducing quantum mechanics, thereby simplifying the entry into\nthis complex field. The course was initially implemented in a program for\ngifted high school students under the Hong Kong Education Bureau and received\nencouraging feedback, indicating its potential effectiveness for a broader\nstudent audience. A key element of this approach is the practical application\nthrough portable NMR quantum computers, which provides students with hands-on\nexperience. The paper describes the structure of the course, including the\norganization of the lectures, the integration of the hardware of the portable\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computers, the Gemini/Triangulum\nseries, and detailed lecture notes in an appendix. The initial success in the\nspecialized program and ongoing discussions to expand the course to regular\nhigh schools in Hong Kong and Shenzhen suggest the viability of this approach\nfor wider educational application. By focusing on accessibility and student\nengagement, this approach presents a valuable perspective on introducing\nquantum computing concepts at the high school level, aiming to enhance student\nunderstanding and interest in the field.\n",

The\nexperiment consists of two identical photons simultaneously entering a\nnon-polarizing beam splitter. The wavefunctions destructively interfere and the\nphoton pairs bunch (both exit the same output) at the outputs whereas\nclassically they are equally likely to exit different outputs. Due to the\nprecision needed to achieve indistinguishability, setup and alignment of this\nexperiment is often considered to be too difficult and time consuming to be\nappropriate for an undergraduate lab, with an end goal of merely demonstrating\nthe HOM interference dip. Here, we present an alternative optical fiber-based\napparatus that gives a consistently reproducible experiment with interference\noccurring in a fused-fiber coupler instead of a traditional beam splitter. We\nuse a commercially available fiber coupled biphoton source that requires\nminimal alignment and increases coherence length of the interference. In\naddition, our biphoton source provides direct temperature based control of the\nfrequency degeneracy of the photon pairs produced, allowing for students to\ninvestigate physical properties of HOM interference such as coherence length\nand interference visibility. Through use of standard opto-mechanical parts\ncombined with the commercially available fiber integrated biphoton source and\nlaser, our apparatus is a middle ground between built-from-scratch and\npre-aligned setups.\n",

It was partially because most image processing artificial\nintelligence models were not accessible to general educational scholars or\nexplainable due to their complex deep neural network architecture. However, the\nrecent development of Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques is\naccomplishing usable visual language models, which receive from the user a\nquestion about the given image and returns an answer, both in natural language.\nParticularly, GPT-4V released by OpenAI, has wide opened the state-of-the-art\nvisual langauge model service so that VQA could be used for a variety of\npurposes. However, VQA and GPT-4V have not yet been applied to educational\nstudies much. In this position paper, we suggest that GPT-4V contributes to\nrealizing VQA for education. By 'realizing' VQA, we denote two meanings: (1)\nGPT-4V realizes the utilization of VQA techniques by any educational scholars\nwithout technical/accessibility barrier, and (2) GPT-4V makes educational\nscholars realize the usefulness of VQA to educational research. Given these,\nthis paper aims to introduce VQA for educational studies so that it provides a\nmilestone for educational research methodology. In this paper, chapter II\nreviews the development of VQA techniques, which primes with the release of\nGPT-4V. Chapter III reviews the use of image analysis in educational studies.\nChapter IV demonstrates how GPT-4V can be used for each research usage reviewed\nin Chapter III, with operating prompts provided.

However, it\nfaces challenges such as improving student interaction with learning content\nand peers, particularly in Japanese universities where digital technologies are\nnot always fully utilized. To address these challenges and identify potential\nsolutions, a case study was conducted in which an online flipped course on\nacademic skills was developed and implemented in an immersive virtual\nenvironment. The primary objective during this initial phase was not to\nestablish a causal relationship between the use of immersive flipped learning\nand students' engagement and perceived learning outcomes. Instead, this\ninitiative aimed to explore the benefits and challenges of the immersive\nflipped learning approach in relation to students' online engagement and their\nperceived learning outcomes. Following a mixed-methods research approach,\nquantitative and qualitative data were collected through a survey (N=50) and\nstudents' reflective reports (N=80). The study revealed high levels of student\nengagement and perceived learning outcomes, although it also identified areas\nneeding improvement, particularly in supporting student interactions in the\ntarget language. Despite the exploratory nature of this study, the findings\nsuggest that a well-designed flipped learning approach, set in an engaging\nimmersive environment, can significantly enhance student engagement, thereby\nsupporting the learning process. When creating an immersive flipped learning\ncourse, educators should incorporate best practices from the literature on both\nflipped learning and immersive learning design to ensure optimal learning\noutcomes. The findings of this study can serve as a valuable resource for\neducators seeking to design engaging and effective remote learning experiences.\n",

However, common representations\nvary widely, and existing categorisation systems do not adequately distinguish\nbetween them in QP. To address this, we developed a new set of differentiation\ncriteria based on insights from representation research, QP education, and\nspecific aspects of the quantum sciences. We created a comprehensive category\nsystem for evaluating visual QP representations for educational use, grounded\nin Ainsworths (2006) DeFT Framework. Twenty-one experts from four countries\nevaluated this category system using four qubit representations: the Bloch\nsphere, Circle Notation, Quantum Bead, and the pie chart (Qake) model. This\nevaluation enabled us to assess the discriminative power of our criteria and\nthe effectiveness of each representation in supporting the learning of QP\nconcepts. It evaluated how well each representation conveyed quantum concepts\nsuch as quantum state, measurement, superposition, entanglement, and quantum\ntechnologies (X-, Z-, and H-gates) across 16 criteria. The results showed\nsignificant differences in the effectiveness of these representations,\nparticularly in conveying key concepts like superposition and measurement.\nAdditionally, expert ratings indicated notable variations in the potential of\neach representation to induce misconceptions, linked to differences in shape,\nmeasurement behaviour, and requirements for understanding entanglement.

In addition, individuals who aspire to enter academia generally\nmaintain a stable state of mind, as evidenced by their consistent work\nefficiency in the face of personal challenges. Interestingly, although some\naspiring academics come from financially stable families, most have encountered\nfinancial constraints. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of\nhow personality traits and socioeconomic factors influence the academic career\npaths of physics students.\n",

Integrating them into upper\nsecondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. This\ncontribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology course\nfor upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launched\nduring the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The course\naimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics while\nhighlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonian\nmechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learning\nmaterials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, while\nsystematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the upper\nsecondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an active\nlearning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engaging\napplications related to current research, reflective exercises, thought\nexperiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explore\nwhether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology course\ncould be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students.\nA pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes,\nincluding interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance of\nscience. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, with\nlarge to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles.\nAdditionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed.\nWe conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondary\nphysics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging,\ncomprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.\n",

The recent proliferation of generative artificial\nintelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new\nconsiderations about how these tools can help or hinder students' development\nof STEM problem-solving competency. Our research examines these considerations\nby studying how and why college students use genAI tools in their STEM\ncoursework, focusing on their problem-solving support. We surveyed 40 STEM\ncollege students from diverse U.S. institutions and 28 STEM faculty to\nunderstand instructor perspectives on effective genAI tool use and guidance in\nSTEM courses. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications\nof genAI tools among STEM students.

The primary motivation for using genAI tools was to save\ntime. Moreover, over half of student participants reported simply inputting\nproblems for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own\nproblem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoption\nrates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short\nin enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies.

An understanding of measurement uncertainty is the\nbasis for confidence in measurements and is required by many communities; among\nothers in national metrology institutes, accreditation bodies, calibration and\ntesting laboratories, as well as in legal metrology, at universities and in\ndifferent metrology fields. An important cornerstone to convey an understanding\nof measurement uncertainty is to provide training.\n  This article identifies the status and the needs for training on measurement\nuncertainty in each of the above communities as well as among those teaching\nuncertainty. It is the first study to do so across many different disciplines,\nand it merges many different sources of information with a focus on Europe. As\na result, awareness on the training needs of different communities is raised\nand teachers of uncertainty are supported in addressing their audiences' needs,\nin improving their uncertainty-specific pedagogical knowledge and by\nsuggestions for training materials and tools.\n  The three needs that are most commonly encountered in the communities\nrequiring an understanding of measurement uncertainty, are 1) to address a\ngeneral lack of training on measurement uncertainty, 2) to gain a better\noverview of existing training on measurement uncertainty in several\ncommunities, and 3) to deliver more training on specific technical topics\nincluding use of a Monte Carlo method for propagating probability distributions\nand treating multivariate measurands and measurement models.\n  These needs will serve to guide future developments in uncertainty training\nand will, ultimately, contribute to increasing the understanding of\nuncertainty.\n",

In\ncases of experimental interest like pion or nuclear beta decay an oscillation\npattern is expected indeed only for neutrinos if only one of the two produced\nparticles is observed. We argue that flavor oscillations of neutrinos without\ndetecting the accompanying lepton is a peculiarity of the two-particle states\n$|l\\nu>$ produced in pion or nuclear beta decay. Generally, an oscillation\npattern is only found if both particles are detected. We discuss in a\npedagogical way how this distinction of the neutrinos arises, although on the\nlevel of the Lagrangian lepton mixing does not single them out against charged\nleptons. As examples, we discuss the difference between the state $|l\\nu>$\nproduced by the decay of real $W$ boson and a $W$ originating from pion decay.\n",

For example during the oscillations of a\npendulum or a vibrating reed, the powering of a lamp and achieving of its full\nintensity. The powering of a relay and the closure of its contacts etc.\nSituations like these call for a time measuring device between two events.\nHence this article describes a general Bi-Event timer that can be used in a\nphysics lab for ubiquitous time lapse measurements during experiments. These\nmeasurements in turn can be used to interpret other parameters like velocity,\nacceleration etc. The timer described here is simple to build and accurate in\nperformance. The Bi-event occurence can be applied as a signal to the inputs of\nthe timer either on separate lines or along a single path in series as voltage\npulses.\n",

It is therefore desirable to have\nsolutions to simple double well potentials that are accessible to the\nundergraduate student. We describe a method for obtaining the numerically exact\neigenenergies and eigenstates for such a model, along with the energies\nobtained through the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. The exact\nsolution is accessible with elementary mathematics, though numerical solutions\nare required. We also find that the WKB approximation is remarkably accurate,\nnot just for the ground state, but for the excited states as well.\n",

The evolution of any\nbroadly applied model is accompanied by multiple generalizations that aim to\nresolve conceptual difficulties and to explain the ever-growing pool of\nobservational data. In the case of Standard Cosmological Model one of the most\npromising directions of generalization is replacement of the cosmological\nconstant with a more complicated, dynamic, form of dark energy and\nincorporation of interaction between the dark components---dark energy (DE) and\ndark matter (DM). Typically, DE models are based on scalar fields minimally\ncoupled to gravity, and do not implement explicit coupling of the field to the\nbackground DM. However, there is no fundamental reason for this assumption in\nthe absence of an underlying symmetry which would suppress the coupling. Given\nthat we do not know the true nature of either DE or DM, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that there is some kind of coupling between them. Whereas\ninteractions between DE and normal matter particles are heavily constrained by\nobservations (e.g. in the solar system and gravitational experiments on Earth),\nthis is not the case for DM particles. In other words, it is possible for the\ndark components to interact with each other while not being coupled to standard\nmodel particles. Therefore, the possibility of DE-DM interaction should be\ninvestigated with utmost gravity.\n  This version contains only formulations of 117 problems.

Key ones were that:\nstudents need to understand that central to science is argumentation,\ncriticism, and analysis; students should be educated to appreciate science as\npart of our culture; students should be educated to be science literate; what\nis meant by the nature of science as discussed in much of the science education\nliterature must be broadened to accommodate a science literacy that includes\npreparation for socioscientific issues; teaching for science literacy requires\nthe development of new assessment tools; and, it is difficult to change what\nscience teachers do in their classrooms. The principal conclusions drawn by the\neditors are that: to prepare students to be citizens in a participatory\ndemocracy, science education must be embedded in a liberal arts education;\nscience teachers alone cannot be expected to prepare students to be\nscientifically literate; and, to educate students for scientific literacy will\nrequire a new curriculum that is coordinated across the humanities,\nhistory/social studies, and science classrooms.\n",

        "summary": "  There are few opportunities in introductory physics for a genuine discussion\nof the philosophy of science, especially in cases where the physical principles\nare straightforward and the mathematics is simple. Terrestrial classical\nmechanics satisfies these requirements, but students new to physics usually\ncarry too many incorrect or misleading preconceptions about the subject for it\nto be analyzed epistemologically. The problem of dark matter, and especially\nthe physics of spiral galaxy velocity rotation curves, is a straightforward\napplication of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation, and is just enough\nremoved from everyday experience to be analyzed from a fresh perspective. It is\nproposed to teach students about important issues in the philosophy of physics,\nincluding Bacon's induction, Popper's falsifiability, and the Duhem-Quine\nthesis, all in light of the dark matter problem. These issues can be discussed\nin an advanced classical mechanics course, or, with limited simplification, at\nthe end of a first course in introductory mechanics. The goal is for students\nto understand at a deeper level how the physics community has arrived at the\ncurrent state of knowledge.\n",

They are part of an actual science\nproblem solving process: By playing, players help scientists, and thereby\ninteract with real continuous research processes. This mixes the two worlds of\nplay and science in new ways. During usability testing we discovered that users\nof the crowdscience game Quantum Dreams tended to answer questions in game\nterms, even when directed explicitly to give science explanations.We then\nexamined these competing frames of understanding through a mixed correlational\nand grounded theory analysis. This essay presents the core ideas of\ncrowdscience games as learning opportunities, and reports how a group of\nplayers used \"game\", \"science\" and \"conceptual\" frames to interpret their\nexperience. Our results suggest that oscillating between the frames instead of\nsticking to just one led to the largest number of correct science\ninterpretations, as players could participate legitimately and autonomously at\nmultiple levels of understanding.\n",

The sessions\ntook place at Institutions in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador,\nPeru and Bolivia at an advanced undergraduate and graduate level.

Monte Carlo methods\nform a particularly important class of numerical methods for solving problems\nin statistical physics. Although these methods are simple in principle, their\nproper use requires a good command of statistical mechanics, as well as\nconsiderable computational resources. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate\nhow the usage of widely accessible graphics cards on personal computers can\nelevate the computing power in Monte Carlo simulations by orders of magnitude,\nthus allowing live classroom demonstration of phenomena that would otherwise be\nout of reach. As an example, we use the public goods game on a square lattice\nwhere two strategies compete for common resources in a social dilemma\nsituation. We show that the second-order phase transition to an absorbing phase\nin the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and we\ncompare the time needed to arrive at this result by means of the main processor\nand by means of a suitable graphics card. Parallel computing on graphics\nprocessing units has been developed actively during the last decade, to the\npoint where today the learning curve for entry is anything but steep for those\nfamiliar with programming. The subject is thus ripe for inclusion in graduate\nand advanced undergraduate curricula, and we hope that this paper will\nfacilitate this process in the realm of physics education. To that end, we\nprovide a documented source code for an easy reproduction of presented results\nand for further development of Monte Carlo simulations of similar systems.\n",

This gives rise to the need for scientific\ncommunities to adapt on shorter time scales than traditional university\ncurricula allow for, and therefore requires new modes of knowledge transfer.\nThe universal applicability of data science tools to a broad range of problems\nhas generated new opportunities to foster exchange of ideas and computational\nworkflows across disciplines. In recent years, hack weeks have emerged as an\neffective tool for fostering these exchanges by providing training in modern\ndata analysis workflows. While there are variations in hack week\nimplementation, all events consist of a common core of three components:\ntutorials in state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning and project work in a\ncollaborative environment. In this paper, we present the concept of a hack week\nin the larger context of scientific meetings and point out similarities and\ndifferences to traditional conferences. We motivate the need for such an event\nand present in detail its strengths and challenges. We find that hack weeks are\nsuccessful at cultivating collaboration and the exchange of knowledge.\nParticipants self-report that these events help them both in their day-to-day\nresearch as well as their careers.

Images of Enceladus' South Pole showed several\nfissures in the ice shell with plumes constantly exhausting frozen water\nparticles, building up the E-Ring, one of the outer rings of Saturn. In this\nsouthern region of Enceladus, the ice shell is considered to be as thin as 2\nkm, about an order of magnitude thinner than on the rest of the moon. Under the\nice shell, there is a global ocean consisting of liquid water. Scientists are\ndiscussing different approaches the possibilities of taking samples of water,\ni.e. by melting through the ice using a melting probe. FH Aachen UAS developed\na prototype of maneuverable melting probe which can navigate through the ice\nthat has already been tested successfully in a terrestrial environment. This\nmeans no atmosphere and or ambient pressure, low ice temperatures of around 100\nto 150 K (near the South Pole) and a very low gravity of 0.114 m/s$^2$ or 1100\n{\\mu}g. Two of these influencing measures are about to be investigated at FH\nAachen UAS in 2017, low ice temperature and low ambient pressure below the\ntriple point of water. Low gravity cannot be easily simulated inside a large\nexperiment chamber, though. Numerical simulations of the melting process at\nRWTH Aachen however are showing a gravity dependence of melting behavior.\nConsidering this aspect, VIPER provides a link between large-scale experimental\nsimulations at FH Aachen UAS and numerical simulations at RWTH Aachen. To\nanalyze the melting process, about 90 seconds of experiment time in reduced\ngravity and low ambient pressure is provided by the REXUS rocket.\n",

        "summary": "  Quantum physics, which describes the strange behavior of light and matter at\nthe smallest scales, is one of the most successful descriptions of reality, yet\nit is notoriously inaccessible. Here we provide an approachable explanation of\nquantum physics using simple thought experiments. We derive all relevant\nquantum predictions using minimal mathematics, without introducing the advanced\ncalculations that are typically used to describe quantum physics. We focus on\nthe two key surprises of quantum physics, namely wave-particle duality, a term\nthat was introduced to capture the fact that single quantum particles in some\nrespects behave like waves and in other respects like particles, and\nentanglement, which applies to two or more quantum particles and brings out the\ninherent contradiction between quantum physics and seemingly obvious\nassumptions regarding the nature of reality. Following arguments originally\nmade by John Bell and Lucien Hardy, we show that the so-called local hidden\nvariables are inadequate at explaining the behavior of entangled quantum\nparticles. This means that one either has to give up on hidden variables, i.e.,\nthe idea that the outcomes of measurements on quantum particles are determined\nbefore an experiment is actually carried out, or one has to relinquish the\nprinciple of locality, which requires that no causal influences should be\nfaster than the speed of light and is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of\nrelativity. Finally, we describe how these remarkable predictions of quantum\nphysics have been confirmed in experiments. We have successfully used the\npresent approach in a course that is open to all undergraduate students at the\nUniversity of Calgary, without any prerequisites in mathematics or physics.\n",

To study the\ngroup dynamics of introductory physics students at the University of Helsinki,\nwe collected network data from seven laboratory course sections of\napproximately 20 students each for seven consecutive weeks. The data was\ncollected via the SocioPatterns platform, and supplemented with students' major\nsubject, year of study and gender. We also collected the Mechanics Baseline\nTest to measure physics knowledge and the Colorado Learning Attitudes about\nScience Survey to measure attitudes. We developed metrics for studying the\nsmall networks of the laboratory sessions by using connections of the teaching\nassistant as a constant. In the network, we found both demographically\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous groups that are stable. While some students are\nconsistently loosely connected to their networks, we were not able to identify\nrisk factors. Based on our results, the physics laboratory course is equally\nsuccessful in building strongly connected groups regardless of student\ndemographics in the sections or the formed small groups. SocioPatterns\nsupplemented with surveys thus provides an opportunity to look into the\ndynamics of students' social networks.\n",

However, at many universities student\nenrollment patterns can be much more complicated, as it is not uncommon for\nstudents to alternate between full-time and part-time enrollment each semester\nbased on finances, scheduling, or family needs. While prior research has\nestablished full-time students maintain better outcomes then their part-time\ncounterparts, limited study has examined the impact of enrollment patterns or\nstrategies on academic outcomes. In this paper, we applying a Hidden Markov\nModel to identify and cluster students' enrollment strategies into three\ndifferent categorizes: full-time, part-time, and mixed-enrollment strategies.\nBased the enrollment strategies we investigate and compare the academic\nperformance outcomes of each group, taking into account differences between\nfirst-time-in-college students and transfer students. Analysis of data\ncollected from the University of Central Florida from 2008 to 2017 indicates\nthat first-time-in-college students that apply a mixed enrollment strategy are\ncloser in performance to full-time students, as compared to part-time students.\nMore importantly, during their part-time semesters, mixed-enrollment students\nsignificantly outperform part-time students. Similarly, analysis of transfer\nstudents shows that a mixed-enrollment strategy is correlated a similar\ngraduation rates as the full-time enrollment strategy, and more than double the\ngraduation rate associated with part-time enrollment. Such a finding suggests\nthat increased engagement through the occasional full-time enrollment leads to\nbetter overall outcomes.\n",

These programs\nare inherently convergent, complex, often resource intensive and likely require\ncollaboration with a broad variety of stakeholders. In order to address this\ncombination of challenges, we have captured ideas from many members in the\ncommunity. This manuscript not only addresses policy makers and funding\nagencies (both public and private and from the regional to the international\nlevel) but also contains needs identified by industry leaders and discusses the\ndifficulties inherent in creating an inclusive QISE curriculum. We report on\nthe status of eighteen post-secondary education programs in QISE and provide\nguidance for building new programs. Lastly, we encourage the development of a\ncomprehensive strategic plan for quantum education and workforce development as\na means to make the most of the ongoing substantial investments being made in\nQISE.\n",

Since the Schr\\\"odinger equation belongs to a special case of wave\nequations I start the course with introducing the wave equation. The\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is derived with the help of the two quantum concepts\nintroduced by Max Planck, Einstein, and de Broglie, i.e., the energy of a\nphoton $E=\\hbar\\omega$ and the wavelength of the de Broglie wave $\\lambda=h/p$.\nFinally, the difference between the classical wave equation and the quantum\nSchr\\\"odinger one is explained in order to help the students to grasp the\nmeaning of quantum wavefunction $\\Psi({\\bf r},t)$. A comparison of the present\nmethod to the approaches given by the authors of quantum mechanics textbooks as\nwell as that of the original Nuffield A level is presented. It is found that\nthe present approach is different from those given by these authors, except by\nWeinberg or Dicke and Wittke. However, the approach is in line with the\noriginal Nuffield A level one.\n",

For several years, we have been teaching an astro-animation class at the\nMaryland Institute College of Art as a collaboration between students and NASA\nscientists. Working in small groups, the students create short animations based\non the research of the scientists who are going to follow the projects as\nmentors. By creating these animations, students bring the power of their\nimagination to see the research of the scientists through a different lens.\nAstro-animation is an undergraduate-level course jointly taught by an\nastrophysicist and an animator. In this paper we present the motivation behind\nthe class, describe the details of how it is carried out, and discuss the\ninteractions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a program\noffers an effective way for art students, not only to learn about science but\nto have a glimpse of \"science in action\". The students have the opportunity to\nbecome involved in the process of science as artists, as observers first and\npotentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships\nat NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have been available for our students in the\nsummer. Two students describe their experiences undertaking these internships\nand how science affects their creation of animations for this program and in\ngeneral. We also explain the genesis of our astro-animation program, how it is\ntaught in our animation department, and we present the highlights of an\ninvestigation of the effectiveness of this program we carried out with the\nsupport of an NEA research grant. In conclusion we discuss how the program may\ngrow in new directions, such as contributing to informal STE(A)M learning.\n",

Here we studied how different instructional strategies led to\ndifferent social configurations and their differences in individual academic\nperformance in an experiment with 82 first-year students from an introductory\nphysics course. Surprisingly, we found that students who actively seek out\ninformation on multiple peers are less likely to achieve good performance on\nwell-structured (algebra-based) problems, whereas, for ill-structured\n(real-world-like) problems, this effect depended on the features of the\nlearning environment. Besides, we observed that good performance on ill and\nwell-structured problems responded to different social network configurations.\nIn a highly clustered network (which contains redundant information), students\nperformed well-structured problems better than ill-structured problems. In\ncontrast, students with access to network structural holes (which enable access\nto more diverse information) performed ill-structured problems better than\nwell-structured problems. Finally, ill-structured problems could promote\ncreative thinking, provided that instructors guide the solving process and\nmotivate students to engage in the appropriate cognitive demands these problems\nentail. Our results suggest that teaching and instructional strategies play an\nimportant role in cooperative learning; therefore, educators implementing\ncooperative learning methods have to accompany them with adequate instructional\nstrategy.\n",

In this way, quantum literacy can contribute to UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goal 4, Quality Education. We argue that quantum literacy, as\ndefined here, addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition\nwithin a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful\nknowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners throughout\nthe life course, both students and professionals. It is increasingly important\nthat the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with\nreal world applications in a more inclusive way. We therefore argue for the\nimportance of addressing pedagogic issues when powerful knowledge consists of\ndense concepts, as well as complex and hierarchical relations between concepts,\nin addition to presenting a strong barrier to entry in the form of mathematics.\nWe introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to\nachieve these pedagogic ends with respect to quantum computation. Visualization\nthrough puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still\nrigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility\nfor non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum\nalgorithms. Using the Hong-Ou-Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we\ndemonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle\nvisualization tool, can be very useful for understanding underlying complex\nprocesses in quantum physics and beyond and therefore support the aims of\nquantum literacy.\n",

This is the gauge theory, the\nfoundation for how all physical interactions are described and a guiding\nprinciple for almost all work on new physics theories. Is it not our duty as\nphysicists to try and spread this knowledge to a wider audience?\n  Here, two simple gauge theory models are presented that should be\nunderstandable without any advanced mathematics or physics and it is\ndemonstrated how they can be used to show how gauge symmetries are used to\nconstruct the standard model of particle physics. This is also used to describe\nthe real reason we need the Higgs field.\n  Though these concepts are complicated and abstract, it seems possible for at\nleast first year students to understand the main ideas. Since they typically\nare very interested in cutting edge physics, they do appreciate the effort and\nenjoy the more detail insight into modern particle physics. These results are\ncertainly encouraging more efforts in this direction.\n",

The solid grains acquire large negative charges on\ntheir surface and exhibits collective behavior similar to the ambient plasma\nmedium. Some remarkable features of the charged dust grain medium (dusty\nplasma) allow us to use it as a model system to understand some complex\nphenomena at a microscopic level. In this perspective paper, the author\nhighlights the role of dusty plasma experiments as a learning tool at\nundergraduate and post-graduate physics programs. The students could have great\nopportunities to understand some basic physical phenomena as well as to learn\nmany advanced data analysis tools and techniques by performing dusty plasma\nexperiments. How a single dusty plasma experimental device at a physics\nlaboratory can help undergraduate and post-graduate students in the learning\nprocess is discussed.\n",

Moreover,\na general matrix diagonalization method that is easily accessible to\nundergraduate students taking a first course in quantum mechanics is used.\nBeginning with a brief review of wave packet transport in the continuum limit,\ncomparisons are made with its counterpart in a lattice. The numerical results\nobtained through the diagonalization method are then benchmarked against\nanalytic results. The case of a resonant dimer is investigated in the lattice,\nand several resonant values of the mean wave packet momentum are identified.\nThe transmission coefficients obtained for a plane wave incident on a step\npotential and rectangular barrier are compared by investigating an equivalent\nscenario in a lattice. Lastly, we present several short simulations of the\nscattering process which emphasize how a simple methodology can be used to\nvisualize some remarkable phenomena.\n",

        "summary": "  The long-term success of HEP lies in expanding inclusiveness beyond national\nlabs and academic research institutions to a vast community of predominantly\nundergraduate institutions (PUI) and community colleges (CC). Institutions such\nas PUIs and CCs offer an early starting point in the pipeline that can mitigate\nissues of lack of diversity and underrepresented participation of different\ngroups in HEP. However, there are many underlying systemic, structural, and\ncultural challenges that need to be addressed collectively. Experimental\ncollaborations are largely populated by national labs and research-focused\nacademic institutions (non-PUIs). The faculty at PUIs and CCs have a high\nteaching load that is detrimental to their research participation. In addition,\nthere is a lack of guidance, access, and tough competition for securing\nresearch funding. The students also suffer from a lack of research\ninfrastructure and technical equipment that can only be found at national labs\nand larger universities. There are existing successful efforts to enhance the\nHEP research experience of students and faculty members. This paper discusses\nways to leverage these to provide more research opportunities and establish a\nsustainable national program targeting specifically the issues faced by\ncommunities at PUIs and CCs. The need for research mentoring and skill building\nfor faculty members is also laid out. The changes discussed in this paper would\nmake a direct impact on the current spectrum of challenges.\n",

Skills and knowledge developed during HEPA (High Energy Physics\nand Astrophysics) research as an undergraduate, graduate or a postdoc level\n(collectively called early career) have been long sought after in industry.\nThese skills are complex problem solving abilities, software programming, data\nanalysis, math, statistics and scientific writing, to name a few. Given that a\nvast majority transition to the industry jobs, existing paths for such\ntransition should be strengthened and new ways of facilitating it be identified\nand developed. A strong engagement between HEPA and its alumni would be a\npre-requisite for this. It might also lead to creative ways to reverse the\n\"brain drain\" by encouraging alumni to collaborate on HEPA research projects or\npossibly come back full time to research. We motivate and discuss below several\nactionable recommendations by which HEPA institutions as well as HEPA faculty\nmentors can strengthen both ability to identify non-HEP career opportunities\nfor students and post-docs as well as help more fully develop skills such as\neffective networking, resume building, project management, risk assessment,\nbudget planning, to name a few.

One way to show motion in galaxies are rotation curves that\nare plots of velocity measurements of how fast stars and gas move in a galaxy\naround the center of mass. According to Newton's Law of Gravitation, the\nrotational velocity is an indication of the amount of visible and non-visible\nmass in the galaxy. Given that the visible matter is measurable using\nphotometry, dark matter mass can therefore be estimated, offering an insight\ninto the size distribution in galaxies. In order to gain a greater appreciation\nof the research scientists' findings about dark matter, their method should be\neasily reproduced by any curious individual. Our interactive workshop is an\nexcellent educational tool to investigate how dark matter impacts the rotation\nof visible matter by providing a guide to produce galactic rotation curves. The\nPython-based notebooks are set up to walk you through the whole process of\nproducing rotation curves using an online database (SPARC) and to allow you to\nlearn about each component of the galaxy. The three steps of the rotation curve\nbuilding process is plotting the measured velocity data, constructing the\nrotation curves for each component, and fitting the total velocity to the\nmeasured values.\n",

To date,\nno research has yet assessed whether these potential issues are actually\npresent in popular communication about quantum science. In this content\nanalysis, we have examined the presence of these potential issues in 501 TEDx\ntalks with quantum science and technology content. Results show that while most\nexperts (70%) explained at least one underlying quantum concept (superposition,\nentanglement or contextuality) of quantum 2.0 technology, only 28% of the\nnon-experts did so. Secondly, the spooky/enigmatic frame was present in about a\nquarter of the talks.

Is it\npossible to restore a unitary vision of knowledge, overcoming the\nscientific-humanistic dichotomy that has established itself over time? The\nanswer is certainly not trivial, but we can start from school to experience a\nnew vision of a unified knowledge. From this need, the Gravitas project has\nborn. Gravitas is a multidisciplinary outreach and educational program devoted\nto high school students (17-19 years old) that mixes contemporary physics and\nthe philosophy of science.

Although the\nconceive-design-implement-operate (CDIO) approach and the computational\nthinking (CT) are hot topics in recent decade, there are still two\ndeficiencies: the CDIO approach and CT are discussed separately and a general\nframework of coping with complex STEM problems in system modeling and\nsimulation is missing. In this paper, a collaborative strategy based on the\nCDIO and CT is proposed for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling\nand simulation with a general framework, in which the CDIO is about ``how to\ndo\", CT is about ``how to think\", and the project means ``what to do\". As an\nillustration, the problem of solving the period of mathematical pendulum (MP)\nis discussed in detail. The most challenging task involved in the problem is to\ncompute the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (CEI-1). In the\nphilosophy of STEM education, all problems have more than one solutions. For\ncomputing the CEI-1, four methods are discussed with a top-down strategy, which\nincludes the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method,\nGauss-Chebyshev method and Gauss-Legendre method. The algorithms involved can\nbe utilized for R & D projects of interest and be reused according to the\nrequirements encountered.

Besides being\ninaccessible for Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) users, such figurative\nvisual representation can lead to misunderstandings about the real nature of\nthe represented object if the code of representation is not declared. We argue\nthat multi-sensory representations clearly arbitrary, i.e., that do not aim to\nimitate reality, are a valid choice for an effective meaning-making process of\nastronomical science for all. In an equity perspective, multi-sensory\nrepresentations also create an effective common ground for inclusion among\npeople with diverse abilities, skills, and learning styles, in the framework of\nUniversal Design for Learning. In order to investigate our hypothesis we\ndesigned two mono-sensory representation (one only haptic and the other only\nacoustic) and tested them in individual and group workshops with both sighted\nand BVI users. We then used our results to guide the design of a multi-sensory\nrepresentation of non-visible astronomical data including visual, acoustic, and\nhaptic stimuli. We tested this representation as well, in order to refine and\npropose it to the public. The result is the exhibit Sense the Universe, to be\nused for outreach and education.

A prime focus in this context is the Software and System Level\nsupport for quantum computers, which has shown promising potential in\nsignificantly decreasing this gap. However, a noteworthy deficit of quantum\nsoftware and system level-focused courses has been observed in academia\nworldwide. Addressing this deficiency, this paper proposes the Quantum Computer\nSystems (QuCS) Lecture Series. The QuCS Lecture Series aims to enhance the\nvisibility of quantum computing software and system level and foster diverse\nparticipation in quantum computing research across multiple universities\nworldwide. It is envisioned as an inclusive platform to bring together\nindividuals of diverse backgrounds, catalyzing cross-cultural collaboration and\ninnovation in this burgeoning field. The lecture series begins with an\nintroductory session elucidating the core concepts and fundamentals of quantum\ncomputing. This foundational knowledge will be built upon in subsequent\nsessions, highlighting cutting-edge research trends and recent findings in\nquantum software and system level. This paper provides a comprehensive overview\nof the QuCS Lecture Series, detailing the format, the gamut of topics to be\ncovered, and their significance. It emphasizes the potential impact of the\nseries on accelerating progress towards quantum supremacy and fostering a\ndiverse, global community of quantum computing researchers and practitioners.\nThe QuCS Lecture Series has already hosted nearly 40 lectures with over 40\nconfirmed speakers from more than eight different countries and from both\nacademia and industry, QuCS also attracted more than 1000 subscribers from all\nover the world.\n",

Our novel teaching proposal comprises debating the basic\nelements of control theory without requiring any background on advanced\nmathematical frameworks from the part of the students. The methodology\naddresses, conceptually, the majority of the steps required for the analysis\nand design of simple control systems. Herein, we thoroughly detail this\neducational guideline, as well as tools that can be used in the classroom.\nFurthermore, we propose a cheap test-bench kit and an open-source numerical\nsimulator that can be used to carry out experiments during the proposed course.\nMost importantly, we also assess on how the Introduction to process control\ncourse has affected the undergraduate program on Control and Automation\nEngineering at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC, Brazil).\nSpecifically, we debate the outcomes of implementing our education approach at\nUFSC from 2016 to 2023, considering students' rates of success in other control\ncourses and perspectives on how the chair helped them throughout the course of\ntheir program.

With quantum teleportation likely to play a key role in several\ncommunication technologies and the quantum internet in the future, it is\nimperative to create learning tools and approaches that can accurately and\neffectively communicate the concept. Recent research has indicated the\nimportance of teachers enthusing students about the topic of quantum physics.\nTherefore, educators at both high school and early university level need to\nfind engaging and perhaps unorthodox ways of teaching complex, yet interesting\ntopics such as quantum teleportation.

In addition, we outline a worksheet designed for use in the classroom\nsetting which is based on common naive conceptions from quantum physics. This\nworksheet will be evaluated as a classroom resource to teach quantum\nteleportation in a subsequent study.\n",

We pull from philosophy and psychology\nto define ethical decision making using the Four Component Model. This model\nstates that in order to make an ethical decision someone must consider four\ncomponents: moral sensitivity, moral reasoning, moral motivation, and moral\nimplementation. We formed a moderated fellowship of fourteen science faculty\nfrom different disciplines who met for ten sessions over the course of a year,\nwhere they discussed the values embedded in different scientific norms. We then\nconducted interviews before and after the year-long fellowship that involved\nguided reflection of scenarios where there was some kind of ethical misconduct\nwhere the scientific practice required value judgements (e.g using unpublished\ndata in their own work). We looked at how the fellowship affected the\nscientists' ability to recognize ethical dimensions regarding the scenarios.

Players must strategically place\ncards on a central card, simulating interactions based on strong,\nelectromagnetic, weak, and gravitational forces. Specific rules for particle\nplacement, including fundamental forces, annihilation and neutrino oscillations\nare elucidated. Additional rules and conditions add complexity and strategy to\nthe game, ensuring active engagement. The intended audience ranges from\nindividuals familiar with particle physics to those new to the field. The game\nprovides an engaging platform for learning about elementary particle\ninteractions, with varying levels of complexity. The paper discusses the\neducational potential, offering suggestions for simplified versions.\nFurthermore, all necessary concepts are briefly explained, and the physical\nbackground of the game is provided. The paper concludes with topics for further\ndiscussions, linking game experiences to particle physics concepts. Questions\ncover gravitational interaction interpretations, differentiation between quarks\nand leptons, explanations of weak and electromagnetic interactions and more.\nThe acknowledgment section expresses gratitude to mentors and pioneers of card\ngames with elementary particles for their inspiration and support.\n",

We discuss their features and potential role in bringing\ncontemporary physics topics to high school, and how to use them to integrate\nformal educational programs. We make an explicit example of the use of\nstorytelling and theatrical techniques to introduce secondary school students\nto black holes and gravitational waves topics. The activity has been designed\nby the Educational Division of the Physics Department at the University of\nCagliari. Participants were 200 high-school students (17 to 19 years old) from\nfive schools (scientific, humanities) in Sardinia. A measure of the efficacy in\nthe use of artistic tools to communicate and teach the proposed subjects has\nbeen done utilizing a research questionnaire. We collected 76 answers. Results\nshow that our methodology is useful to introduce students to contemporary\nphysics themes, fostering their interest and learning of such contents.\nStudents from humanities significantly appreciated more the use of poetry and\nartistic tools than their scientific peers. Finally, we discuss the\npotentiality of our approach in orientating students towards a STEAM (STEM and\nArts) career.\n",

However, this development creates a gap in current\ncomputer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly\nphysics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of\ncomputer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difficult,\nin particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there\nis consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for specific\ncomputational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems -\ncombined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an\napplication on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system\nthus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum\nmachine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the\nsystem. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future\nrequirements in this emerging field, we need to prepare a new generation of\ncomputer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum\ncomputing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula,\nwe designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical\nSystems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement\ncomputational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum.\nWhile learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are\nobligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with,\nmaking the entrance to the field of quantum computing comprehensive yet\nappealing and accessible to students of computer science.\n",

The paper begins with a\ndiscussion of the Framework for K-12 Science Education, which calls for a shift\nfrom conceptual learning to knowledge-in-use. This shift necessitates the\ndevelopment of new types of assessments that align with the Framework's three\ndimensions: science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and\ncrosscutting concepts. The paper further highlights the limitations of\ntraditional assessment methods like multiple-choice questions, which often fail\nto capture the complexities of scientific thinking and three-dimensional\nlearning in science. It emphasizes the need for performance-based assessments\nthat require students to engage in scientific practices like modeling,\nexplanation, and argumentation. The paper achieves three major goals: reviewing\nthe current state of ML-based assessments in science education, introducing a\nframework for scoring accuracy in ML-based automatic assessments, and\ndiscussing future directions and challenges. It delves into the evolution of\nML-based automatic scoring systems, discussing various types of ML, like\nsupervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. These systems can\nprovide timely and objective feedback, thus alleviating the burden on teachers.\nThe paper concludes by exploring pre-trained models like BERT and finetuned\nChatGPT, which have shown promise in assessing students' written responses\neffectively.\n",

The platform offers various functionalities, such as synchronous\ntransmission and reception of low-frequency signals, frequency measurement,\ndynamic frequency sweep measurement, and measurement using the three-point\napproximation method. The proposed platform has been successfully applied in\nexperiments involving forced vibration, resonance of tuning forks, and dynamic\nmeasurement of Young's modulus.

        "summary": "  Astronomy, of all the sciences, is possibly the one with the most public\nappeal across all age groups. This is also evidenced by the existence of a\nlarge number of planetaria and amateur astronomy societies, which is unique to\nthe field. Astronomy is known as a `gateway science', with an ability to\nattract students who then proceed to explore their interest in other STEM\nfields too. Astronomy's link to society is therefore substantive and diverse.\nIn this white paper, six key areas are analysed, namely outreach and\ncommunication, astronomy education, history and heritage, astronomy for\ndevelopment, diversity, and hiring practices for outreach personnel.\n  The current status of each of these areas is described, followed by an\nanalysis of what is needed for the future. A set of recommendations for\ninstitutions, funding agencies, and individuals are evolved for each specific\narea. This work charts out the vision for how the astronomy-society connection\nshould take shape in the future, and attempts to provide a road-map for the\nvarious stakeholders involved.\n",

We show that linear\noscillators alternately in contact with hot and cold baths obey this principle\nin the quantum as well as in the classical regime. The expression of the work\nperformed is derived from a simple prescription. Reversible and non-reversible\ncycles are illustrated.

        "summary": "  There is a nationwide drive to get more girls into physics and coding, and\nsome educators believe gaming could be a way to get girls interested in coding\nand STEM topics. This project, sponsored by NSF, is to create a QCD game that\nwill raise public interest in QCD, especially among K-12 girls, and increase\ninterest in coding among girls. Through the immersive framework of interactive\ngameplay, this QCD phone game will allow the public to peek into the QCD\nresearch world. The game design will fall into the \"Match 3\" genre, which\ntypically attracts a higher ratio of female players. The game will be\nimplemented initially as a phone app, and the gameplay would require learning\nsimple QCD rules to progress. By leveraging the willingness of players to\nengage with the rules of an entertaining game, they are able to easily learn a\nfew principles of physics. The game is now available to download from the\nGoogle Play store\n(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gellab.quantum3) and the\nApple Appstore (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quantum-3/id1406630529)!\n  We formed a development team of MSU undergraduate students to make the game\nand provided them with a QCD curriculum. The game will be tested at MSU\noutreach activities, as well as among local K-12 girls through school\nactivities, and feedback will be used to improve the design. The final game can\nbe easily distributed through various app stores and impact will be measured\nthrough a follow-up survey. If such a new direction works to attract more girls\nto coding and physics, one should develop more games to engage more girls in\nSTEM.\n",

In this\nopening paper of the proceedings book, I describe them and document their\nstrong impact on the academic life of the local institutions. The advanced\nresearch course was open to graduate students, senior researchers, and\nmotivated under-graduate students with good background in physics and\nmathematics. The course covered several multi-disciplinary issues of modern\nresearch on astrophysical dynamics, and thus also of interest to physicists,\nmathematicians and engineers. The major topic was gas dynamics, viewed in\ncontext with stellar dynamics and plasma physics. The course was complemented\nby parallel seminars on hot topics given by experts in such fields, and open to\na wide scientific audience. In particular, I gave a friendly introduction to\nwavelets, which are becoming an increasingly powerful tool not only for\nprocessing signals and images but also for analysing fractals and turbulence,\nand which promise to have important applications to dynamical modelling of disc\ngalaxies. The workshop was open to a wide scientific audience. The workshop\nwith published proceedings book was, as a matter of fact, the innovative form\nof exam that I proposed for the advanced research course. The contributions\nwere refereed and their quality is high on average, exceptionally high in a few\ncases. The advanced research course and the workshop all together produced\ngreat enthusiasm in the students and welcomed the participation of a hundred\ndifferent people, which means an order of magnitude more than an average\ngraduate course at Chalmers University of Technology and G\\\"oteborg University.\n",
