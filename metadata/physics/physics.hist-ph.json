        "summary": "  In two respects Ludwig Boltzmann was a pioneer of quantum mechanics. First\nbecause in his statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics\nhe introduced the theory of probability into a fundamental law of physics and\nthus broke with the classical prejudice, that fundamental laws have to be\nstrictly deterministic. Even Max Planck had not been ready to accept\nBoltzmann's statistical methods until 1900. With Boltzmann's pioneering work\nthe probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics had already a precedent.\nIn fact in a paper in 1897 Boltzmann had already suggested to Planck to use his\nstatistical methods for the treatment of black body radiation. The second\npioneering step towards quantum mechanics was Boltzmann's introduction of\ndiscrete energy levels. Boltzmann used this method already in his 1872 paper on\nthe H-theorem. One may ask whether Boltzmann considered this procedure only as\na mathematical device or whether he attributed physical significance to it. In\nthis connection Ostwald reports that when he and Planck tried to convince\nBoltzmann of the superiority of purely thermodynamic methods over atomism at\nthe Halle Conference in 1891 Boltzmann suddenly said: ``I see no reason why\nenergy shouldn't also be regarded as divided atomically.'' Finally I would like\nto mention, that Boltzmann in his lectures on Natural Philosophy in 1903\nalready anticipated the equal treatment of space coordinates and time\nintroduced in the theory of special relativity. Furthermore in the lectures by\nBoltzmann and his successor Fritz Hasen\\\"ohrl in Vienna the students learned\nalready about noneuclidean geometry, so that they could immediately start to\nwork when Einstein's general theory of relativity had been formulated.\n",

The Majorana-Oppenheimer form of electrodynamics, the\nSachs' theory of Elementary Matter, the analysis of the action-at-a-distance\nconcept, presented recently by Chubykalo and Smirnov-Rueda, and the analysis of\nthe claimed `longitudinality' of the antisymmetric tensor field after\nquantization are reviewed in this essay.

This\ndiscovery suggested the use of photons emitted without recoil in crystalline\nsolids for testing both time dilation and gravitational red shift. Finally,\naround 1970, Hafele and Keating dealt again with time dilation by sending\nmacroscopic atomic clocks around the Earth. The interpretations of these\nexperiments by experimenters have been characterized by the use of additional\nhypotheses not necessary for the formal development of the theories under test\n(the idea that all clocks measure proper time) or hypotheses completely\nextraneous to the theories themselves (the idea that atoms are clocks). If\nthese assumptions are dropped, it turns out that the only experiments\nconcerning time dilation are those performed with elementary particles in\ninertial flight.

In the context of Einstein's Relativity, the sole frame which is\nprivileged in Arago's experiment is the proper frame of the prism, and the null\nresult only says that Snell's law is valid in that frame.

We expose the dissimilar treatment received by the ray and\nthe wave front as an unavoidable consequence of the classical notions of space\nand time.\n",

At the same time, they can present difficulties for a\npublication in the documentary edition of the Collected Papers of Albert\nEinstein (CPAE). The problems are illustrated by discussing how some important\nexamples of Einstein's research manuscripts have been included in previous\nvolumes of the CPAE series: his Scratch Notebook from the years 1910-1914, his\nso-called Zurich Notebook from 1912, documenting his early search for a\ngenerally covariant theory of gravitation, and the Einstein-Besso manuscript\nfrom 1913, containing calculations of Mercury's perihelion advance on the basis\nof the Einstein-Grossmann equations. Another category of research notes are\n\"back-of-an-envelope\" calculations. A major challenge for future volumes of the\nCPAE series are Einstein's Berlin and Princeton research manuscripts on a\nunified field theory. This batch of some 1700 undated manuscript pages presents\na formidable challenge also for historians of science. Although the web\nprovides new possibilities for the editorial task, such as the publication of\nfacsimiles on the Einstein Archives Online website, it is argued that a\nsatisfactory solution of the editorial problems posed by these manuscripts\ndepends on scholarly efforts to reconstruct and understand the content of\nEinstein's manuscripts.\n",

Why\ndid Goethe champion his Farbenlehre so ardently even years after it was\ndismissed by almost everyone else? In answering this question, this essay will\nattempt to add to the existing scholarship by considering Goethe's Theory of\nColors in the context of his natural philosophy, and generalizing the variety\nof objectifications of the concepts invoked by his color theory and their\nrelationships to Goethe's epistemology and Newton's mechanics. In this fashion,\nI attempt to show that the reason for Goethe's self-assessment of his Theory of\nColors is less enigmatic than appears from its examination solely as a work of\nphysics. Rather, Zur Farbenlehre was the clearest expression of Goethe's most\nuniversal archetype-- polarity of opposites-- which bridged Goethe's conflicts\nwith Kant's and Spinoza's epistemologies, and in an over-reaching way served as\na cosmology underlying Goethe's art and his science.\n",

Considering three distinct temporal stages, we re-examine the roles\nof the main contributors to the porcelain project, referring to the role of the\nMercantilism system and to the philosophical roots of Tschirnhaus's method.\n",

The case of George Placzek appears as an\nexcellent one to illustrate the procedure and its problems.

He worked in a large\nnumber of places with some of the most outstanding collaborators and also as\nsole author during his short professional life. His publications appeared in\nregular, so-called source journals, in books, lecture notes and also internal\nreports which were classified till several years after the end of the war.

In fact,\nalthough he intended to defend what seemed to him to be orthodoxy, he himself\nbecame a heterodox. I suggest that Wigner's conjectures on the role of\nconsciousness in physical phenomena were not fruitful and were discarded, being\ntoday part of the history of physics rather than physics proper. However, his\nideas and actions left an indelible mark on the physics of the second half of\nthe 20th century. Namely, he formulated his ideas in opposition to the\nCopenhagen monocracy, which held a stronghold on the interpretation of quantum\nphysics until the late 1960s; he stressed the unsolved status of the\nmeasurement problem; and he effectively defended his ideas and supported those\nwho were willing to investigate the foundations of quantum physics. He thus\ncontributed to the creation of a new field of physical research, that of the\nfoundations of quantum physics, which attributed a higher scientific status to\nthe old controversy on the interpretations and foundations of this theory. This\nnew field has had to deal with important theoretical, experimental, and\nphilosophical issues, and significant repercussions have arisen in the last\ndecades.\n",

After\nleaving Aristotelian metaphysics, early modern science had to cope with these\nproblems: it did so by introducing ``space'' as the seat of stability, and\n``time'' as the theater of motion. But the ontological structure present in\nthis solution remained the same. Therefore the fundamental notion `separable\nsystem', related to the notions observation and measurement, themselves related\nto the modern concepts of space and time, appears to be intrinsically\nproblematic, because it is inextricably connected to classical logic on the\nontological level. We see therefore the problems dealt with by quantum logic\nnot as merely formal, and the problem of `non-locality' as related to it,\nindicating the need to re-think the notions `system', `entity', as well as the\nimplications of the operation `measurement', which is seen here as an\napplication of classical logic (including its ontological consequences) on the\nmaterial world.\n",

Detecting\nparallax would be solid evidence for the Earth's motion, but failure to detect\nparallax could be explained by the stars lying at great distances. Recent work\npertaining to Galileo's observations of double stars illustrates Galileo's\nskill as an observer. It also indicates that, given the knowledge of optics of\nthe time, Galileo could expect his measurements to be accurate enough that they\nwould have revealed stellar parallax had it existed. Thus parallax was not a\n\"win-win situation\" after all. It could be solid evidence against the Earth's\nmotion, evidence which fortunately did not dissuade Galileo from the Copernican\nview.\n",

This paper will argue, after\nexploring their interpretation, that the experiments were a relevant part of\nthe background to such celebrated contributions to quantum mechanics as Born's\nstatistical interpretation of the wave function and Heisenberg's uncertainty\nprinciple. Yet, the Einstein-Rupp experiments have hardly received attention in\nthe history of quantum mechanics literature.

In a key contribution to the 1925 Dreimaennerarbeit with Born and\nHeisenberg, Jordan showed that one recovers both terms in a simple model of\nquantized waves. So the two terms do not require separate mechanisms but arise\nfrom a single consistent dynamical framework. Several authors have argued that\nvarious infinities invalidate Jordan's conclusions. In this paper, we defend\nJordan's argument against such criticism. In particular, we note that the\nfluctuation in a narrow frequency range, which is what Jordan calculated, is\nperfectly finite. We also note, however, that Jordan's argument is incomplete.\nIn modern terms, Jordan calculated the quantum uncertainty in the energy of a\nsubsystem in an energy eigenstate of the whole system, whereas the thermal\nfluctuation is the average of this quantity over an ensemble of such states.\nStill, our overall conclusion is that Jordan's argument is basically sound and\nthat he deserves credit for resolving a major conundrum in the development of\nquantum physics.\n",

Shortly thereafter Ralph Kronig and,\nindependently, Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck took up a less radical\nstance by suggesting that this degree of freedom somehow corresponded to an\ninner rotational motion, though it was unclear from the very beginning how\nliteral one was actually supposed to take this picture, since it was\nimmediately recognised (already by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck) that it would very\nlikely lead to serious problems with Special Relativity if the model were to\nreproduce the electron's values for mass, charge, angular momentum, and\nmagnetic moment. However, probably due to the then overwhelming impression that\nclassical concepts were generally insufficient for the proper description of\nmicroscopic phenomena, a more detailed reasoning was never given. In this\ncontribution I shall investigate in some detail what the restrictions on the\nphysical quantities just mentioned are, if they are to be reproduced by rather\nsimple classical models of the electron within the framework of Special\nRelativity. It turns out that surface stresses play a decisive role and that\nthe question of whether a classical model for the electron does indeed\ncontradict Special Relativity can only be answered on the basis of an\n\\emph{exact} solution, which has hitherto not been given.\n",

This confirms that such a system was not his own invention.\nEthnohistorical and archaeological evidence provide support for Duquesne's\ncalendar model. Massive Muisca ceremonies described by 16th century Spanish\nchroniclers, is examined and; the occurrence of such ceremonies seem to match\nthe astronomical cycle of conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, wich\nalso agrees with the 60-year span described by Duquesne as the Muisca Acrotom\nCentury.

        "summary": "  Since Descartes' dualism, with his res extensa and res cogitans, six\nfundamental problems in the philosophy and natural history of mind are these:\n1. how does mind act on matter? 2. If mind does not act on matter is mind a\nmere epiphenomenon? 3. What might be the source of free will? 4. What might be\nthe source of a responsible free will? 5. Why might it have been selectively\nadvantageous to evolve consciousness? 6. What is consciousness? I approach the\nfirst five of the above six problems based on two physical postulates. First\nthe mind-brain system is a quantum coherent, but reversibly decohering and\nrecohering system. This allows me to answer 1) above, mind does not act\ncausally on brain at all, rather it acausally decohers to classicity (for all\npractical purposes), hence has consequences for brain and body as matter.\nEpiphenomenalism is averted. A quantum mind, because it is acausal on\nCopenhagen including Born, yields a free will, but a merely random free will,\nnot a responsible free will. Second, the most radical part of this article\nproposes that the quantum classical interface is not always describable by a\nlaw: specifically in a special relativity setting, no function, F, maps the\npresent state of the system mind-brain into its future. In its place is a\nnonrandom yet lawless process. I seek in this non-random yet lawless process a\nsource for a responsible free will. Finally, if the quantum-classical boundary\ncan be non-random yet lawless, then no algorithmic simulation of the world or\nourselves can calculate the real world, hence the evolutionary selective\nadvantages for evolving consciousness to know it may be great. I make no\nprogress on problem 6, the hard problem of qualia.\n",

While its architecture has been well studied,\nits function remains uncertain. This paper argues that both the design and the\nmeaning of the Pantheon are in fact dependent upon an understanding of the role\nof the sun in the building, and of the apotheosised emperor in Roman thought.\nSupporting evidence is drawn not only from the instruments of time in the form\nof the roofed spherical sundial, but also from other Imperial monuments,\nnotably Nero's Domus Aurea and Augustus's complex of structures on the Campus\nMartius: his Ara Pacis, the \"Horologium Augusti\", and his Mausoleum. Hadrian's\nMausoleum and potentially part of his Villa at Tivoli are drawn into this\nargument as correlatives. Ultimately, it is proposed that sun and time were\nlinked architecturally into cosmological signposts for those Romans who could\nread such things.\n",

        "summary": "  In Minoan art, symbols for celestial objects were depicted frequently and\noften in a religious context. The most common were various solar and stellar\nsymbols. The palace of Knossos was amply decorated with these symbols. The\nrituals performed in Knossos and other Minoan palaces included the alteration\nof light and darkness, as well as the use of reflection. The Minoan primary\ngoddess was a solar goddess, the 'Minoan Demeter'. A Late Minoan clay disk has\nbeen identified as a ritual calendrical object showing the most important\ncelestial cycles, especially the lunar octaeteris. The disk, as well as the\nMinoan stone kernoi, were probably used in relation to the Minoan festival\ncalendar. The orientations of the central courts of the palaces of Knossos,\nPhaistos, Mallia and Gournia were to the rising sun, whereas the Eastern\npalaces Zakros and Petras were oriented to the southernmost and the\nnorthernmost risings of the moon, respectively. The E-W axes of the courts of\nKnossos and Phaistos were oriented to the sunrise five days before the vernal\nequinox. This orientation is related to the five epagomenal days in the end of\na year, which was probably the time of a Minoan festival. One of the\norientations of the Knossian Throne Room is towards the heliacal rising of\nSpica in 2000-1000 BCE. Spica rose heliacally at the time of vintage in Minoan\ntimes. The time near the date of the heliacal rising of Spica was the time of\nan important festival related to ctchonic deities, the Minoan predecessor of\nthe Eleusinian Mysteries. The myths of Minos, Demeter and Persephone probably\nhave an astronomical origin, related to Minoan observations of the periods of\nthe moon, Venus and Spica. These celestial events were related to the idea of\nrenewal, which was central in the Minoan religion.\n",

By\nthe fifth century BC the island is effectively 'Hellenised' and ancient\nhistorians record the political and military action of poleis, Greek\ncity-states. Each polis has traditionally been seen as the offshoot of a city\nelsewhere. Genealogies of cities ultimately end in cities found in the cities\nof the Peloponnese and the Aegean. The 'Greek' identity of the Sicilian cities\nis part of a wider debate on the concept of Identity in the ancient world. This\npaper considers if there is a contribution archaeoastronomers can make to such\ndiscussions by considering the alignments of Greek temples. Greek religion was\nintimately related to notions of civic identity and what it meant to be\n'Greek'. I propose a method of studying small samples of temples, which\ncombines both alignment analysis and historical context. Therefore it may be\npossible that a study of the temples may yield useful information about\ncollective identities. However, as this method shows, the more ambiguous the\ncultural data the less certain any astronomical patterns may be.\n",

It contains an attempt to extend and exhaust\nthe characterization of the monatomic ideal gas without appealing to\ncombinatorics. Its ambiguities illustrate Einstein's confusion with his initial\nsuccess in extending Bose's results and in realizing the consequences of what\nlater became to be called Bose-Einstein statistics. We discuss Einstein's\nmotivation for writing a non-combinatorial paper, partly in response to\ncriticism by his friend Ehrenfest, and we paraphrase its content. Its arguments\nare based on Einstein's belief in the complete analogy between the\nthermodynamics of light quanta and of material particles and invoke\nconsiderations of adiabatic transformations as well as of dimensional analysis.\nThese techniques were well-known to Einstein from earlier work on Wien's\ndisplacement law, Planck's radiation theory, and the specific heat of solids.\nWe also investigate the possible role of Ehrenfest in the gestation of the\ntheory.\n",

We wish to point out that\nmuch simpler possibilities intrinsic to electromagnetism already exist from\nwhich we may get at the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis. In\nparticular we consider an example going back to Poincar\\'e in [{\\it Bulletin\ndes Sciences math\\'ematiques}, 28, (1904) pp. 302-324], in which he considers\nthe problem of two moving, parallel line charges in order to get at length\ncontraction.

Apparently, it took an extremely sensitive experiment, not\nintrinsic to electromagnetism, such as was the Michelson-Morley experiment,\ntogether with the efforts of persons with authority, like Lorentz and\nPoincar\\'e, trying to uphold the relativity principle before the radical notion\nof length contraction could seriously be entertained, and making ripe the way\nfor the genius of Einstein.\n",

A synopsis of each argument is presented here, with discussion and\nanalysis. Seen through Riccioli's 126 arguments, the debate over the Copernican\nhypothesis appears dynamic and indeed similar to more modern scientific\ndebates. Both sides present good arguments as point and counter-point.\nReligious arguments play a minor role in the debate; careful, reproducible\nexperiments a major role. To Riccioli, the anti-Copernican arguments carry the\ngreater weight, on the basis of a few key arguments against which the\nCopernicans have no good response. These include arguments based on telescopic\nobservations of stars, and on the apparent absence of what today would be\ncalled \"Coriolis Effect\" phenomena; both have been overlooked by the historical\nrecord (which paints a picture of the 126 arguments that little resembles\nthem). Given the available scientific knowledge in 1651, a geo-heliocentric\nhypothesis clearly had real strength, but Riccioli presents it as merely the\n\"least absurd\" available model - perhaps comparable to the Standard Model in\nparticle physics today - and not as a fully coherent theory. Riccioli's work\nsheds light on a fascinating piece of the history of astronomy, and highlights\nthe competence of scientists of his time.\n",

The goal of\nthis text is to study the implications of relativity and quantum mechanics on\npresentism, possibilism, and eternalism. We put the emphasis on the implicit\nmetaphysical preconceptions underlying each of these different approaches to\nthe question of time. We show that there exists a unique version of presentism\nwhich is both non-trivial, in the sense that it does not reduce the present to\na unique event, and compatible with special relativity and quantum mechanics:\nthe one in which the present of an observer at a point is identified with the\nbackward light cone of that point. However, this compatibility is achieved at\nthe cost of a renouncement to the notion of an objective, observer-independent\nreality. We also argue that no non-trivial version of presentism survives in\ngeneral relativity, except if some mechanism forbids the existence of closed\ntimelike curves, in which case precisely one version of possibilism does\nsurvive. We remark that the above physical theories force the\npresentist/possibilist's view of reality to shrink and break up, whereas the\neternalist, on the contrary, is forced to grant the status of reality to more\nand more entities. Finally, we identify mathematics as the \"deus ex machina\"\nallowing the eternalist to unify his vision of reality into a coherent whole,\nand offer to him an \"idealist deal\": to accept a mathematical ontology in\nexchange for the assurance of surviving any physical theory.\n",

This is one of the most\nimportant achievements in the history of physics. In contrast to Newton's\nPrincipia and Galilei's Dialogo Kepler's text is not easy to read, for various\nreasons. Therefore, in the present article, his results -- most of them well\nknown -- are first presented in modern language. Then, in order to justify the\nclaim, the full text of some relevant chapters of Astronomia Nova is presented.\nThe translation from latin is by the present author, with apologies for its\nshortcomings.\n",

In the context of lattice\ngauge theory, the statement that local gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously\nbroken can even be made rigorous in the form of Elitzur's theorem.\nNevertheless, gauge symmetry breaking does occur in gauge quantum field\ntheories in the form of the breaking of remnant subgroups of the original local\ngauge group under which the theories typically remain invariant after gauge\nfixing. The paper discusses the relation between these instances of symmetry\nbreaking and phase transitions and draws some more general conclusions for the\nphilosophical interpretation of gauge symmetries and their breaking.\n",

The article analyses the struggles that\narise in the course of determining what counts as theory, as model and even as\na simulation. Such debates are especially decisive when working across\ndisciplinary boundaries, and their resolution is an important part of the work\ninvolved in building simulations. In particular, we show how ontological\narguments about the value of simulations tend to determine the direction of\nsimulation-building. This dynamic makes it difficult to maintain an interest in\nthe heterogeneity of simulations and a view of simulations as unfolding\nscientific objects. As an outcome of our analysis of the process and\nreflections about interdisciplinary work around simulations, we propose a\nchart, as a tool to facilitate discussions about simulations. This chart can be\na means to create common ground among actors in a simulation-building project,\nand a support for discussions that address other features of simulations\nbesides their ontological status. Rather than foregrounding the chart's\nclassificatory potential, we stress its (past and potential) role in discussing\nand reflecting on simulation-building as interdisciplinary endeavor.

This event\nwas the gale which according to Captain Scott, lasted nine/ten days. Were the\nlaws of physics suspended at the end of March 1912 in the Antarctic? I have\nshown that the near surface winds in the Antarctic are self-organized\ncritically and that the winds over the continent form an ergodic system. I have\npresented an analysis of wind events in the proximity of Captain Scott's camp\nand at Ross Island. By comparing wind events at these locations, and performing\nan analysis of a gale's wind duration and strength at One Ton Dep\\^ot, I\nconcluded that Captain Scott's wind record was highly inaccurate. I concluded\nthat the nine/ten day gale described by Captain Scott, that lasted from March\n21 to 29, did not take place. This result combined with my previous analysis of\nCaptain Scott's temperature record, shows that two black swan meteorological\nevents: February 27-March 19, 1912 - Extreme Cold Snap and March 21-29, 1912 -\nNever Ending Gale reported by Captain Scott, did not take place.

The\nperceived crisis was an issue not only in microphysics but also in cosmology,\nwhere it resulted in ambitious cosmophysical theories that transcended the\nordinary methods of physics. The uncertain cognitive situation was, in some\ncircles, associated to the uncertain political and moral situation. Did the\nproblems of foundational physics demand a revolution in thinking that somehow\nparalleled the political revolutions of the time? I argue that although such\nideas were indeed discussed in the 1930s, they were more rhetoric than reality.\nWith the benefit of hindsight one can see that the perceived crisis was only\ntemporary and not significantly related to social or ideological developments\nin the decade.\n",

        "summary": "  The precise position of a spectral line emitted by an atomic system depends\non the mass of the atomic nucleus and is therefore different for isotopes\nbelonging to the same element. The possible presence of an isotope effect\nfollowed from Bohr's atomic theory of 1913, but it took several years before it\nwas confirmed experimentally. Its early history involves the childhood not only\nof the quantum atom, but also of the concept of isotopy. Bohr's prediction of\nthe isotope effect was apparently at odds with early attempts to distinguish\nbetween isotopes by means of their optical spectra. However, in 1920 the effect\nwas discovered in HCl molecules, which gave rise to a fruitful development in\nmolecular spectroscopy. The first detection of an atomic isotope effect was no\nless important, as it was by this means that the heavy hydrogen isotope\ndeuterium was discovered in 1932. The early development of isotope spectroscopy\nillustrates the complex relationship between theory and experiment, and is also\ninstructive with regard to the concepts of prediction and discovery.\n",

The work of physicists such as Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr,\namong others, was pivotal to the so-called planetary model of the atom, which,\nstill today, is used in popular accounts and in science textbooks. In an\nattempt to add to our knowledge about the popular trajectory of the new atomic\nphysics, this paper examines one book in particular, coauthored by Danish\nscience writer Helge Holst and Dutch physicist and close collaborator of Niels\nBohr, Hendrik A. Kramers. Translated from Danish into four European languages,\nthe book not only presented contemporary ideas about the quantum atom, but also\nwent into rather lengthy discussions about unresolved problems. Moreover, the\nbook was quite explicit in identifying the quantum atom with the atom as\ndescribed by Bohr's theory. We argue that Kramers and Holst's book, along with\nother atomic books, was a useful tool for physicists and science popularisers\nas they grappled with the new quantum physics.\n",

        "summary": "  In 1895 Hendrik Antoon Lorentz derived the Fresnel dragging coefficient in\nhis theory of immobile ether and electrons. This derivation did not explicitly\ninvolve electromagnetic theory at all. According to the 1922 Kyoto lecture\nnotes, before 1905 Einstein tried to discuss Fizeau's experiment \"as originally\ndiscussed by Lorentz\" (in 1895). At this time he was still under the impression\nthat the ordinary Newtonian law of addition of velocities was unproblematic. In\n1907 Max Laue showed that the Fresnel dragging coefficient would follow from a\nstraightforward application of the relativistic addition theorem of velocities.\nThis derivation is mathematically equivalent to Lorentz's derivation of 1895.\nFrom 1907 onwards Einstein adopted Laue's derivation. When Robert Shankland\nasked Einstein how he had learned of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein\ntold him that he had become aware of it through the writings of Lorentz, but\nonly after 1905 had it come to his attention. \"Otherwise\", he said, \"I would\nhave mentioned it in my paper\". He continued to say that the experimental\nresults which had influenced him most were stellar aberration and Fizeau's\nwater tube experiment. \"They were enough\". Indeed the famous Michelson-Morley\nexperiment is not mentioned in the 1905 relativity paper; but curiously\nEinstein did not mention Fizeau's experimental result either, and this is\npuzzling in light of the importance of the experiment in Einstein's pathway to\nhis theory. In this paper I try to discuss this question.\n",

In\n1905 Einstein showed that a change in energy is associated with a change in\ninertial mass equal to the change in energy divided by c2. In 1900 Poincar\\'e\nconsidered a device creating and emitting electromagnetic waves. The device\nemits energy in all directions. As a result of the energy being emitted, it\nrecoils. No motion of any other material body compensates for the recoil at\nthat moment. Poincar\\'e found that as a result of the recoil of the oscillator,\nin the moving system, the oscillator generating the electromagnetic energy\nsuffers an \"apparent complementary force\". In addition, in order to demonstrate\nthe non-violation of the theorem of the motion of the centre of gravity,\nPoincar\\'e needed an arbitrary convention, the \"fictitious fluid\". Einstein\ndemonstrated that if the inertial mass E/c2 is associated with the energy E,\nand on assuming the inseparability of the theorem of the conservation of mass\nand that of energy, then - at least as a first approximation - the theorem of\nthe conservation of the motion of the centre of gravity is also valid for all\nsystems in which electromagnetic processes take place. Before 1905 (and also\nafterwards) Poincar\\'e did not explore the inertial mass-energy equivalence. In\n1908 Einstein wrote the German physicist Johannes Stark, \"I was a little\nsurprised to see that you did not acknowledge my priority regarding the\nrelationship between inertial mass and energy\".\n",

In 1905 Poincar\\'e elaborated Lorentz's electron theory from 1904 in two\npapers entitled \"Sur la dynamique de l'electron\". In May 1905 he sent three\nletters to Lorentz at the same time that Albert Einstein wrote his famous May\n1905 letter to Conrad Habicht: \"I can promise you in return four works,[...]\nThe fourth paper is only a rough draft at this point, and is an electrodynamics\nof moving bodies\". In the May 1905 letters to Lorentz Poincar\\'e presented the\nbasic equations of his 1905 Dynamics of the Electron. Hence, in May 1905,\nPoincar\\'e and Einstein both had drafts of papers pertaining to the principle\nof relativity. Poincar\\'e's draft led to a space-time mathematical theory of\ngroups at the basis of which stood the postulate of relativity, and Einstein's\ndraft led to a kinematical theory of relativity.

Van Vleck from his 1926 Bulletin for the\nNational Research Council (NRC) on the old quantum theory to his 1932 book, The\nTheory of Electric and Magnetic Susceptibilities. We highlight the continuity\nof formalism and technique in the transition from dealing with spectra in the\nold quantum theory to dealing with susceptibilities in the new quantum\nmechanics. Our main focus is on the checkered history of a numerical factor in\nthe Langevin-Debye formula for the electric susceptibility of gases. Classical\ntheory predicts that this factor is equal to 1/3. The old quantum theory\npredicted values up to 14 times higher. Van Vleck showed that quantum mechanics\ndoes away with this \"wonderful nonsense\" (as Van Vleck called it) and restores\nthe classical value 1/3. The Langevin-Debye formula thus provides an\ninstructive example of a Kuhn loss in one paradigm shift that was regained in\nthe next. In accordance with Kuhn's expectation that textbooks sweep Kuhn\nlosses under the rug, Van Vleck did not mention this particular Kuhn loss\nanywhere in his 1926 NRC Bulletin (though he prominently did flag a Kuhn loss\nin dispersion theory that had recently been regained). Contrary to Kuhn's\nexpectations, however, he put the regained Kuhn loss in susceptibility theory\nto good pedagogical use in his 1932 book. Kuhn claimed that textbooks must\nsuppress, truncate, and/or distort the prehistory of their subject matter if\nthey are to inculcate the exemplars of the new paradigm in their readers. This\nclaim is not borne out in this case. Because of the continuity of formalism and\ntechnique that we draw attention to that Van Vleck could achieve his\npedagogical objectives in his 1932 book even though he devoted about a third of\nit to the treatment of susceptibilities in classical theory and the old quantum\ntheory in a way that matches the historical record reasonably well.\n",

However, it was unable to supply the Perihelion of\nMercury, such as Einstein's theory; it led to a Perihelion like the one\npredicted by Newton's law, and, it could not explain the deflection of light\nnear the sun, because in Nordstr\\\"om's theory the velocity of light was\nconstant. Einstein's 1913-1914 theory, the field equations of which were not\ngenerally covariant, remained without empirical support. Thus a decision in\nfavor of one or the other theory - Einstein's or Nordstr\\\"om's - was impossible\non empirical grounds. Einstein began to study Nordstr\\\"om's theory from the\ntheoretical point of view and he developed his own Einstein-Nordstr\\\"om theory\non the basis of his conception of the natural interval.

In this paper Galileo's first\nobservations of Jupiter's satellites are quantitatively re-analysed by using\nmodern planetarium software. All the angular records reported in the Sidereus\nNuncius are, for the first time, compared with satellites' elongations\ncarefully reconstructed taking into account software accuracy and the\nindeterminacy of observation time. This comparison allows us to derive the\nexperimental errors of Galileo's measurements and gives us direct insight into\nthe effective angular resolution of Galileo's observations. Until now,\nhistorians of science have mainly obtained these indirectly and they are often\nnot correctly estimated. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of Galileo's\nexperimental errors shows an asymmetrical distribution with prevailing positive\nerrors.

In this paper I present a personal and scientific biographical\nsketch of Poincar\\'e, which does not in any way reflect Poincar\\'e's rich\npersonality and immense activity in science: When Poincar\\'e traveled to parts\nof Europe, Africa and America, his companions noticed that he knew well\neverything from statistics to history and curious customs and habits of\npeoples. He was almost teaching everything in science. He was so encyclopedic\nthat he dealt with the outstanding questions in the different branches of\nphysics and mathematics; he had altered whole fields of science such as\nnon-Euclidean geometry, Arithmetic, celestial mechanics, thermodynamics and\nkinetic theory, optics, electrodynamics, Maxwell's theory, and other topics\nfrom the forefront of Fin de Si\\`ecle physical science. It is interesting to\nnote that as opposed to the prosperity of biographies and secondary papers\nstudying the life and scientific contributions of Albert Einstein, one finds\nmuch less biographies and secondary sources discussing Poincar\\'e's life and\nwork. As opposed to Einstein, Poincar\\'e was not a cultural icon. Beginning in\n1920 Einstein became a myth and a world famous figure. Although Poincar\\'e was\nso brilliant in mathematics, he mainly remained a famous mathematician within\nthe professional circle of scientists. He published more papers than Einstein,\nperformed research in many more branches of physics and mathematics, received\nmore prizes on his studies, and was a member of more academies in the whole\nworld.

Einstein's 1907 breakthrough was to\nconsider Galileo's law of free fall as a powerful argument in favor of\nexpanding the principle of relativity to systems moving non-uniformly relative\nto each other. Einstein realized that he might be able to generalize the\nprinciple of relativity when guided by Galileo's law of free fall; for if one\nbody fell differently from all others in the gravitational field, then with the\nhelp of this body an observer in free fall (with all other bodies) could find\nout that he was falling in a gravitational field.\n",

However, due to the lack of direct written accounts and the\nscarcity of inscriptions we do not have a clear knowledge on the precise nature\nof such believes and how these reflected on the calendar or the religious\ntime-keeping system of this ancient society. A statistical analysis of the\norientation of their sacred monuments demonstrates that astronomical\norientations were often part of an elaborated plan and possibly a trace of the\nastral nature of Nabataean religion. Petra and other monuments in the ancient\nNabataean kingdom have proven to be marvellous laboratories of the interaction\nbetween landscape features and astronomical events showing impressive\nhierophanies on particular monuments related to cultic times and worships.\nAmong other findings, the famous Ad Deir has shown a fascinating ensemble of\nlight and shadow effects, perhaps connected with the bulk of Nabataean\nmythology, while from the impressive Urn tomb, a series of suggestive\nsolstitial and equinoctial alignments emanate which might have lately helped\nits selection as the cathedral of the city. This paper demonstrates that the\nsky was a substantial element on Nabataean religion and reveals new evidence\nfor cultic worship centred on the celestial sphere.\n",

This is an empirically\nuntestable thesis and thus lies beyond the scope of science. However, this\nargument presupposes a conception of science which holds that in science\ntheories are accepted solely on the basis of evidence. But this conception of\nscience is untenable. Any fundamental physical theory, in order to be accepted\nas a part of theoretical scientific knowledge, must be (1) sufficiently\nempirically successful, and (2) sufficiently unified. Given any accepted theory\nof physics, endlessly many empirically more successful disunified rivals can\nalways be concocted - disunified because they assert that different dynamical\nlaws govern the diverse phenomena to which the theory applies. These disunified\nrivals are not considered for a moment in physics, despite their greater\nempirical success. This persistent rejection of empirically more successful but\ndisunified rival theories means, I argue, that a big, highly problematic,\nimplicit assumption is made by science about the cosmos, to the effect, at\nleast, that the cosmos is such that all seriously disunified theories are\nfalse. Once this point is recognized, it becomes clear, I argue, that we need a\nnew conception of science which holds that science makes a hierarchy of\nassumptions about the cosmos, these assumptions becoming less and less\nsubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy. One of these assumptions is that the\ncosmos is physically comprehensible. Hence the conclusion: improve our ideas\nabout the nature of science and it becomes apparent that science has\nestablished that the cosmos is physically comprehensible.\n",

A.D.1685) was chosen\nbased on previous works which considered it a valuable source on the history of\noptics that had not been studied before. After studying his major optical\nmanuscript, titled Manazir wa Maraya, it was found very interesting that the\nmajority of al-Qayini's propositions relating to natural phenomena were not\nmerely geometrical definitions, but that the proofs related to astronomy. As an\nexample, in one case, which had not been explained in previous astronomical and\noptical manuscripts, al-Qayini tried, despite lacking a vigorous proof, to show\nhow a special point in a room could be lit up by sunlight throughout the year.\nHis particular interest in astronomy led us to a general study of his other\nworks, and it is worth noting that out of the nineteen works that have been\nattributed to him, eleven are devoted to astronomy and have not been thoroughly\nstudied. Much more research is required on his astronomical manuscripts in\norder to obtain a better understanding of this author, the century in which he\nlived and the general state of science in the late Islamic period. After all,\ngiven the many as-yet unstudied manuscripts that still exist, maybe this\ndecline was not as rapid as has previously been assumed.\n",

A rendition of this essay into English, along with the\nfull text of the essay in the original Latin, is provided in this paper. The\nessay, upon which the Inquisition condemnation was likely based, lists\nmathematical, physical, and theological arguments against the Copernican\ntheory. Ingoli asks Galileo to respond to those mathematical and physical\narguments that are \"more weighty\", and does not ask him to respond to the\ntheological arguments at all. The mathematical and physical arguments Ingoli\npresents are largely the anti-Copernican arguments of the great Danish\nastronomer Tycho Brahe; one of these (an argument based on measurements of the\napparent sizes of stars) was all but unanswerable. Ingoli's emphasis on the\nscientific arguments of Brahe, and his lack of emphasis on theological\narguments, raises the question of whether the condemnation of the Copernican\ntheory was, in contrast to how it is usually viewed, essentially scientific in\nnature, following the ideas of Brahe.\n",

Nonetheless, Bernoulli did not confuse those\ntwo entities: he defined a link from gender to species between the former,\ngeneral, and the latter, organic. Besides, Bernoulli clearly distinguished vis\nviva and potentia absoluta (or work). Their mutual conversions are rarely\nexplicitly mentionned in this book, except once, in the Section X of his work,\nfrom vis viva to work, and subordinated to the mediation of a machine, in a\ndriving forces substitution problem. His attitude significantly evolved in a\ntext in 1753, in which work and vis viva were unambiguously connected, while\nthe concept of potentia absoluta was reduced to the one of men's work, and the\nexpression itself was abandoned. It was then accepted that work can be\nconverted into vis viva, but the opposite is true in only one case, the\nintra-organic one. The concept of tiredness, seen as an expenditure of animal\nspirits conceived themselves as little tensed springs liberating vis viva,\nallowed direct conversion, even never quantified and listed simply as a model,\nfrom vis viva to work. Thus, work may have ultimately appeared as a\ntransitional state between two kinds of vis viva, which the first is\nnon-quantifiable. At the same time, natural elements were discredited from any\nhint of profitable production. Only men and animals were able to work in the\nstrict sense of the word. Nature did not work by itself, according to\nBernoulli. Despite his will to bring together rational mechanics and common\nmechanics, one perceived in the work of Bernoulli the subsistence of a rarely\ncrossed disjunction between practical and theoretical fields.\n",

Surprisingly, given the many astronomical hypotheses and\nspeculations that have been offered in the intervening 130 years, there have\nbeen remarkably few attempts to reaffirm or improve on the basic survey data\nconcerning the primary orientations.\n  This paper presents the results of a week-long Total Station survey\nundertaken by the authors during December 2006 whose principal aim was to\nclarify the basic data concerning the orientation of each side of the three\nlarge pyramids and to determine, as accurately as possible, the orientations of\nas many as possible of the associated structures. The principal difference\nbetween this and all previous surveys is that it focuses upon measurements of\nsequences of points along multiple straight and relatively well preserved\nstructural segments, with best-fit techniques being used to provide the best\nestimate of their orientation, as opposed to simple triangulation between\ndirectly identified or extrapolated corners.\n  Our results suggest that there is only a very slight difference in\norientation (c. 0.5 arc minutes) between the north-south axes of Khufu's and\nKhafre's pyramids, that the sides of Khafre's are more perfectly perpendicular\nthan those of Khufu's, and that the east-west axis is closer to true\ncardinality in both cases.

Early\ncatalogues by the Herschels, Struves, and others began with their own\ndiscoveries. In 1906 court reporter and amateur astronomer Sherburne Wesley\nBurnham published a massive double star catalogue containing data from many\nobservers on more than 13,000 systems. Lick Observatory astronomer Robert Grant\nAitken produced a much larger catalogue in 1932 and coordinated with Robert\nInnes of Johannesburg, who catalogued the southern systems. Aitken maintained\nand expanded Burnham's records of observations on handwritten file cards, and\neventually turned them over to the Lick Observatory, where astrometrist\nHamilton Jeffers further expanded the collection and put all the observations\non punched cards. With the aid of Frances M. \"Rete\" Greeby he made two\ncatalogues: an Index Catalogue with basic data about each star, and a complete\ncatalogue of observations, with one observation per punched card. He enlisted\nWillem van den Bos of Johannesburg to add southern stars, and together they\npublished the Index Catalogue of Visual Double Stars, 1961.0. As Jeffers\napproached retirement he became greatly concerned about the disposition of the\ncatalogues. He wanted to be replaced by another \"double star man,\" but Lick\nDirector Albert E. Whitford had the new 120-inch reflector, the world's second\nlargest telescope, and he wanted to pursue modern astrophysics instead. Jeffers\nwas vociferously opposed to turning over the card files to another institution,\nand especially against their coming under the control of Kaj Strand of the\nUnited States Naval Observatory. The USNO got the files and has maintained the\nrecords ever since, first under Charles Worley, and, since 1997, under Brian\nMason. Now called the Washington Double Star Catalog, it is online.\n",

Einstein's physical geometry enables a\nnon-conventional view on Euclidean geometry (as the geometry associated to\ninertial motion and inertial reference frames) and on the uniform time. Also,\nby taking into account the implications of the view of geometry as a physical\ngeometry, it is presented a critical reassessment of the so-called boostability\nassumption (implicit according to Einstein in the formulation of the theory)\nand also of 'alternative' derivations of the Lorentz transformations that do\nnot take into account the so-called 'light postulate'. Finally it is addressed\nthe issue of the eventual conventionality of the one-way speed of light or,\nwhat is the same, the conventionality of simultaneity (within the same inertial\nreference frame). It turns out that it is possible to see the (possible)\nconventionality of distant simultaneity as a case of conventionality of\ngeometry (in Einstein's reinterpretation of Poincar\\'e's views). By taking into\naccount synchronization procedures that do not make reference to light\npropagation (which is necessary in the derivation of the Lorentz\ntransformations without the 'light postulate'), it can be shown that the\nsynchronization of distant clocks does not need any conventional element. This\nimplies that the whole of chronogeometry (and because of this the physical part\nof the theory) does not have any conventional element in it, and it is a\nphysical chronogeometry.\n",

By developing a formalism for an\nabstract mathematical description of inherently non-mathematical (physical)\nobjects, an attempt is made to clarify the mechanisms and implications of the\nphilosophical tool of Ansatz. Outcomes of this style of analysis include a\npossible explanation for the philosophical issue of the 'unreasonable\neffectiveness' of mathematics as raised by Wigner, and an investigation into\nformal definitions of the terms: 'principles', 'evidence', 'existence' and\n'universes', that are consistent with the conventions used in physics.\n  It is found that the formalism places restrictions on the mathematical\nproperties of objects that represent the tools and terms mentioned above.

In this manuscript, we\npropose a new interpretation of existence that we call physical relativism.\nUnder physical relativism, the difference between mathematical existence and\nphysical existence is clarified, and Wheeler's `it from bit' viewpoint can be\nobjectively evaluated. In addition, physical relativism provides a simple\nanswer to the question of why the universe exists at all, and permits us to\nderive the maximally biophilic principle, a generalization of the anthropic\nprinciple that ascribes high prior likelihood to the observation of a universe\nwith simple physical laws supporting the overall concepts of time, space and\nthe emergent evolution of life.\n",

This epistemological\nviewpoint is based on the philosophical theses advanced by Ludwig Boltzmann\n(1844-1906) which states that scientific theories are nothing more than\nrepresentations, or images, of nature (arXiv:physics/0701308v1). By being\nrepresentations one cannot know how nature really is because the intrinsic and\nindispensable properties that characterize nature are unreachable by science.\nIn other words, the true essences that constitute nature are unknowable.\nTherefore, all answers proposed by science are partial, simplified and\nreplaceable. Another way of putting forward this viewpoint is to state that all\nscientific truths are provisional, a result which naturally leads to the\nconclusion that the same set of phenomena, or scientific questions, may have\nvarious answers, or representations. This conclusion is generally known as\ntheoretical pluralism (arXiv:physics/9806011). It is exactly such a plurality\nfor conceiving, or representing, nature that opens the way for a possibly\nfruitful dialog among the various forms of thinking, since this dialog can take\nplace in the realm of the representations. A few examples taken from cosmology,\nsociology and theology are discussed in the context of this epistemological\nframework.\n",

This pivotal date is considered crucial to the various\ncalculations of the early chronology of the ancient Near East. According to the\nVenus Tablet (Enuma Anu Enlil 63) which describes the rising and setting of\nVenus during the reign of Ammisaduqa, there are only 4 possibilities implying 4\ndates for the destruction of Ur (1912, 1944, 2004, 2064 BCE) but a tablet of\nastronomical omens (Enuma Anu Enlil 20,21) mentions a lunar eclipse, dated\n14/III/48, at the end of the reign of Shulgi and a lunar eclipse, dated\n14/XII/24, at the end of the reign of Ibbi-Sin. Over the period 2200-1850 BCE\nthere are only 3 pairs of eclipses, spaced by 42 years, matching the\ndescription of astronomical omens but only 1 agreeing with the previous 4\ndates. The second way to check the date for the fall of Babylon is to rebuild\nthe chronology of this period thanks to synchronisms dated by astronomy from\nAssyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian and Israelite chronologies which provide\nsynchronisms that can be dated independently. The Mesopotamian chronology of\nthis period is reconstructed using the number of Assyrian eponyms (1 a year)\nand the length of Babylonian reigns combined with the set of synchronisms among\nAssyrian and Babylonian kings in Annals. During the reign of Assur-dan I\n(1179-1133) eponyms began on 1 Nisan instead of 1 Sippu, but Assyrian lunar\nyears without intercalation remained the norm until Tiglath-pileser I. As the\nBabylonian year began on 1st Nisan (just after the spring equinox), Assyrian\nyears coincided with Babylonian lunar years with intercalation, thus the period\nbetween Assur-dan I and Tiglath-pileser I was therefore transitional. Owing to\nthe Babylonian chronology and synchronisms it is possible to date other\nchronologies.\n",

        "summary": "  A number of elite thinkers in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries\npursued an agenda which historian Paolo Rossi calls the \"quest for a universal\nlanguage,\" a quest which was deeply interwoven with the emergence of the\nscientific method. From a modern perspective, one of the many surprising\naspects of these efforts is that they relied on a diverse array of memorization\ntechniques as foundational elements. In the case of Leibniz's universal\ncalculus, the ultimate vision was to create a pictorial language that could be\nlearned by anyone in a matter of weeks and which would contain within it a\nsymbolic representation of all domains of contemporary thought, ranging from\nthe natural sciences, to theology, to law. In this brief article, I explore why\nthis agenda might have been appealing to thinkers of this era by examining\nancient and modern memory feats. As a thought experiment, I suggest that a\nsociety built entirely upon memorization might be less limited than we might\notherwise imagine, and furthermore, that cultural norms discouraging the use of\nwritten language might have had implications for the development of scientific\nmethodology. Viewed in this light, the efforts of Leibniz and others seem\nsignificantly less surprising. I close with some general observations about\ncross-cultural origins of scientific thought.\n",

Einstein desired to eliminate absolute space\nfrom physics according to \"Mach's ideas\". De Sitter objected to the\n\"world-matter\" in Einstein's world, and proposed a vacuum solution of\nEinstein's field equations with the cosmological constant and with no\n\"world-matter\". In 1920 the world-matter of Einstein's world was equivalent to\n\"Mach's Ether\", a carrier of the effects of inertia. De Sitter's 1917 solution\npredicted a spectral shift effect. In 1923 Eddington and Weyl adopted De\nSitter's model and studied this effect. Einstein objected to this \"cosmological\nproblem\". In 1922-1927, Friedmann and Lamaitre published dynamical universe\nmodels. Friedmann's model with cosmological constant equal to zero was the\nsimplest general relativity universe. Einstein was willing to accept the\nmathematics, but not the physics of a dynamical universe. In 1929 Hubble\nannounced the discovery that the actual universe is apparently expanding. In\n1931 Einstein accepted Friedmann's model with a cosmological constant equal to\nzero, which he previously abhorred; he claimed that one did not need the\ncosmological term anymore. It was very typical to Einstein that he used to do a\ntheoretical work and he cared about experiments and observations. This paper is\na new interpretation to Einstein's cosmological considerations over the period\n1917-1931.\n",

But the cosmological\nconstant rears its ugly head again and again and again. Apparently, Einstein\nhimself has never used the apercu \"biggest blunder\"; nevertheless a vast\nliterature grew up around this notion and associated it with Einstein. The\npresent work is prompted by questions put by Mario Livio in his latest book\n\"Brilliant Blunders\" as to the phrase \"biggest blunder\": Did Einstein actually\nsay, \"biggest blunder\"? I show that in 1947 Einstein wrote Lemaitre that he\nfound it \"very ugly\" that the field law of gravitation should be composed of\ntwo logically independent terms. Earlier, in 1922 Einstein wrote Max Born that\nhe committed \"a monumental blunder some time ago\". In 1965 Born commented:\n\"Here Einstein admits that the considerations which led him to the positive-ray\nexperiments were wrong: 'a monumental [capital] blunder'\". It is likely that\nwhen Einstein met Gamow he formulated his views in his native German, and\nperhaps he told Gamow that suggesting his cosmological constant was a\n\"blunder\". I suggest that, Einstein perhaps told Gamow that the cosmological\nconstant was a \"capital blunder\" or a \"monumental blunder\", and Gamow could\nhave embellished Einstein's words to become the famous apercu \"biggest\nblunder\".\n",

In 1914 Einstein wrote\nthe equations for conservation of energy-momentum for matter, and established a\nconnection between these equations and the components of the gravitational\nfield. He showed that a material point in gravitational fields moves on a\ngeodesic line in space-time, the equation of which is written in terms of the\nChristoffel symbols. By November 4, 1915, Einstein found it advantageous to use\nfor the components of the gravitational field, not the previous equation, but\nthe Christoffel symbols. He corrected the 1914 equations of conservation of\nenergy-momentum for matter. Einstein had already basically possessed the field\nequations in 1912 together with his mathematician friend Marcel Grossman, but\nbecause he had not recognized the formal importance of the Christoffel symbols\nas the components of the gravitational field, he could \"not obtain a clear\noverview\". Finally, considering the energy-momentum conservation equations for\nmatter, an important similarity between equations suggests that, this equation\ncould have assisted Einstein in obtaining the final form of the field equations\n(the November 25, 1915 ones) that were generally covariant.\n",

These disagreements do not much affect the ordinary practice of\nscience which is about small subsystems of the universe, described or explained\nagainst a background, idealized to be fixed. But these issues become crucial\nwhen we consider including the whole universe within our system, for then there\nis no fixed background to reference observables to. I argue here that the key\nissue responsible for divergent versions of naturalism and divergent approaches\nto cosmology is the conception of time. One version, which I call temporal\nnaturalism, holds that time, in the sense of the succession of present moments,\nis real, and that laws of nature evolve in that time. This is contrasted with\ntimeless naturalism, which holds that laws are immutable and the present moment\nand its passage are illusions. I argue that temporal naturalism is empirically\nmore adequate than the alternatives, because it offers testable explanations\nfor puzzles its rivals cannot address, and is likely a better basis for solving\nmajor puzzles that presently face cosmology and physics.\n  This essay also addresses the problem of qualia and experience within\nnaturalism and argues that only temporal naturalism can make a place for qualia\nas intrinsic qualities of matter.\n",

        "summary": "  Dennis Dieks advanced the view that the idea of flow of time is implemented\nin the theory of relativity. The 'flow' results from the successive\nhappening/becoming of events along the time-like worldline of a material\nsystem. This leads to a view of now as local to each worldline. Each past event\nof the worldline has occurred once as a nowpoint, and we take there to be an\never-changing present now-point 'marking' the unfolding of a physical system.\nIn Dieks' approach there is no preferred worldline and only along each\nworldline is there a Newtonian-like linear order between successive now-points.\nWe have a flow of time per worldline. Also there is no global temporal order of\nthe now-points of different worldlines. There is, as much, what Dieks calls a\npartial order. However Dieks needs for a consistency reason to impose a\nlimitation on the assignment of the now-points along different worldlines. In\nthis work it is made the claim that Dieks' consistency requirement is, in fact,\ninbuilt in the theory as a spatial relation between physical systems and\nprocesses. Furthermore, in this work we will consider (very) particular cases\nof assignments of now-points restricted by this spatial relation, in which the\nnow-points taken to be simultaneous are not relative to the adopted inertial\nreference frame.\n",

However,\nLewis' photon was a concept of a very different kind, something few physicists\nknew or cared about. It turns out that Lewis' name was not quite the neologism\nthat it has usually been assumed to be. The same name was proposed or used\nearlier, apparently independently, by at least four scientists. Three of the\nfour early proposals were related to physiology or visual perception, and only\none to quantum physics. Priority belongs to the American physicist and\npsychologist L. T. Troland (1889-1932), who coined the word in 1916, and five\nyears later it was independently introduced by the Irish physicist J. Joly\n(1857-1933). Then in 1925 a French physiologist, Rene Wurmser (1890-1993),\nwrote about the photon, and in July 1926 his compatriot, the physicist F.\nWolfers (ca. 1890-1971), did the same in the context of optical physics. None\nof the four pre-Lewis versions of \"photon\" was well known and they were soon\nforgotten.\n",

On\nbasis of logical paradoxes, we argue that FW has a meta-theoretic character,\nlike the concept of truth in Tarski's undefinability theorem. Free will exists\nrelative to a base theory if there is freedom to deviate from the deterministic\nor indeterministic dynamics in the theory, with the deviations caused by\nparameters (representing will) in the meta-theory. By contrast, determinism and\nindeterminism do not require meta-theoretic considerations in their\nformalization, making FW a fundamentally new causal primitive. FW exists\nrelative to the meta-theory if there is freedom for deviation, due to\nhigher-order causes. Absolute free will, which corresponds to our intuitive\nintrospective notion of free will, exists if this meta-theoretic hierarchy is\ninfinite. We argue that this hierarchy corresponds to higher levels of\nuncomputability. In other words, at any finitely high order in the hierarchy,\nthere are uncomputable deviations from the law at that order. Applied to the\nhuman condition, the hierarchy corresponds to deeper levels of the subconscious\nor unconscious mind. Possible ramifications of our model for physics,\nneuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) are briefly considered.\n",

But\nthen they drew back, modifying the theory in a way that spoiled the\nfive-dimensional symmetry and looks contrived to modern readers. Why? According\nto correspondence of Peter Bergmann with the author, the reason was that the\nmore symmetric version of the theory predicts the existence of a new long range\nfield (a massless scalar field). In 1938, Einstein and Bergmann did not wish to\nmake this prediction. (Based on a lecture at the Einstein Centennial\nCelebration at the Library of Alexandria, June, 2005.\n",

James M.\nGilliss,astronomer at the newly founded U.S. Naval Observatory,\nenthusiastically adopted this idea and procured a grant for the young\nastronomical community of the United States for an expedition to Chile. There\nthey were to observe several conjunctions of Venus and oppositions of Mars,\nwhile the accompanying measurements were to be taken at the US Naval\nObservatory in Washington D.C. and the Harvard College Observatory at\nCambridge, USA. This expedition was supported by A. v. Humboldt, C.F. Gau{\\ss},\nJ.F. Encke, S.C. Walker, A.D. Bache, B. Peirce and others. From 1849 to 1852\nnot only were astronomical, but also meteorological and magnetic observations\nand measurements recorded, mainly in Santa Lucia close to Santiago, Chile. By\ncomparing these measurements with those taken simultaneously at other\nobservatories around the world the solar parallax could be calculated, although\nincomplete data from the corresponding northern observatories threatened the\nproject's success. In retrospect this expedition can be recognized as the\nfoundation of the Chilean astronomy. The first director of the new National\nAstronomical Observatory of Chile was Dr. C.W. Moesta, a Hessian student of\nChristian Ludwig Gerling's. The exchange of data between German, American and\nother astronomers during this expedition was well mediated by J.G.

In this draft\nEinstein hopes to have found a solution to the cosmological problem: a\nstationary, dynamic universe in expansion. His model was stationary because\nparticles leaving a given volume were replaced by particles created out of the\nvacuum, anticipating an idea of Bondi, Gold and Hoyle published in 1948.

        "summary": "  Simple assumptions represent a decisive reason to prefer one theory to\nanother in everyday scientific praxis. But this praxis has little philosophical\njustification, since there exist many notions of simplicity, and those that can\nbe defined precisely strongly depend on the language in which the theory is\nformulated. The language dependence is a natural feature - to some extent - but\nit is also believed to be a fatal problem, because, according to a common\ngeneral argument, the simplicity of a theory is always trivial in a suitably\nchosen language. But, this trivialization argument is typically either applied\nto toy-models of scientific theories or applied with little regard for the\nempirical content of the theory. This paper shows that the trivialization\nargument fails, when one considers realistic theories and requires their\nempirical content to be preserved. In fact, the concepts that enable a very\nsimple formulation, are not necessarily measurable, in general. Moreover, the\ninspection of a theory describing a chaotic billiard shows that precisely those\nconcepts that naturally make the theory extremely simple are provably not\nmeasurable. This suggests that - whenever a theory possesses sufficiently\ncomplex consequences - the constraint of measurability prevents too simple\nformulations in any language. This explains why the scientists often regard\ntheir assessments of simplicity as largely unambiguous. In order to reveal a\ncultural bias in the scientists' assessment, one should explicitly identify\ndifferent characterizations of simplicity of the assumptions that lead to\ndifferent theory selections. General arguments are not sufficient.\n",

Once produced, cosmic magnetic fields are able to act back on moving\nfluids. This back-reaction may have dramatic consequences for cosmic structure\nformation, with the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in accretions disks as\nthe most prominent example. Considerable theoretical and computational progress\nhas been made in understanding both the dynamo effect as well as magnetically\ntriggered flow instabilities. Complementary to this, the last fifteen years\nhave seen much effort in studying both effects in liquid metal experiments. We\nsummarize the history of these experiments, discuss their main results and\ntheir limitations, and give an outlook on future activities.\n",

By comparing these astronomical results with\nthe geodetic--determined longitude differences he had recently measured for the\ntriangulation of Kurhessen, he was able to extract a combined value of the\ndeflection of the vertical in longitude of G\\\"ottingen and Mannheim.

It\nconcerns the fact that perceptual processing is so rapid, compared with the\ntypical time-scale on which macroscopic objects change their observable\nproperties, that it engenders the idea of a 'common now', spread across space.\n  The other two connections are specific to quantum theory, as interpreted\nalong the lines of Everett. So for these two connections, the physics side is\ncontroversial, just as the philosophical side is.\n  In Section 3, I connect the subjective uncertainty before an Everettian\n'splitting' of the multiverse to Dummett's suggestion, inspired by McTaggart,\nthat a complete, i.e. indexical-free description of a temporal reality is\nimpossible. And in Section 4, I connect Barbour's denial that time is real---a\ndenial along the lines of Everett, rather than McTaggart---to Dummett's\nsuggestion that statements about the past are not determinately true or false,\nbecause they are not effectively decidable.\n",

Like\nseveral other Aboriginal peoples, they did not travel extensively at night, and\nso were assumed not to use the night sky for navigation. This study has\nconfirmed that they, like most other Aboriginal groups, travelled extensively\noutside their own country for purposes of trade and ceremonies. We also found\nthat, previously unknown, they used star maps in the night sky for learning and\nremembering waypoints along their routes of travel, but not for actual\nnavigation.

That's why philosophy of science\nhas independent position in epistemology and ontology corresponding to\ninterpretation of time as a general category of scientific thinking. The nature\nof time has internally inconsistent (paradoxical) character. Time is phenomenon\nwhich existing and not existing at the same time. This phenomenon is identified\nwith imaginary movement and also ideal (formal) process of formation of the\nnature. The general understanding of time is connected with its \"mathematical\"\nmeaning as calculable formal regulation of language practice and also the\nuniversal organization rules of quantitative parameters of intelligence of\nnatural (physical) processes. From the second side we can say that exist an\nactual branch of philosophy of science. It exists on the basis of disclosure of\naprioristic limits of consciousness of its cultural and historical development.\nThere is possible a special interpretation of time. In that context time is the\nconnection of an action of the cultural phenomenon or its \"energy\" with some\nkind of \"weight\", the historical importance of a separate limit of\nconsciousness through analog of \"distance\" as intensity of cultural and\nhistorical space (or \"oppositional nature of interaction of mental\nintentions\").\n",

Danish astronomy at the time was however based on\nTycho Brahe's view of the universe and therefore hostile to Copernican and, by\nimplication, Galilean cosmology. Although Galileo's telescope attracted much\nattention, it took about thirty years until a Danish astronomer actually used\nthe instrument for observations.

It is argued here that when using the demon to relate\ninformation to work (Landauer's principle), the demon's goal must be regarded\nas an implicit assumption that should not be taken for granted. Other demons\nthan the standard one can be constructed depending on their assumed goal. When\nthe demon is purely mechanical, the goal is instilled in it by its design. When\nthe demon is regarded as \"intelligent\" (Maxwell) and \"endowed with free will\"\n(Thomson), it is not so clear whence he could acquire a specific goal. A\nsolution is to subject the demon to evolution by natural selection, which in an\nextended form can provide the demon with a genuine goal for which work is\nnecessary. This implies that the information the demon acquires and uses for\noperating the engine becomes functional for the demon, and thereby acquires a\nreal physical status. Such information, called functional information, applies\nto all life and technology. It should be distinguished from the formal,\ncausally ineffective information that can be defined, more arbitrarily, for any\nsystem. Information in general is not physical, only functional information is.\nA similar functional/formal distinction applies to close associates of\ninformation, in particular entropy, probability, and the second law of\nthermodynamics.\n",

These structures, commonly\nindicated as castellieri, are earthworks of quadrangular shape, with sides\nranging from 140 to 250 m.

It may be that quantum gravity\nrepresents the breakdown of spacetime geometry described by GR. The\nrelationship between quantum gravity and spacetime has been deemed \"emergence\",\nand the aim of this thesis is to investigate and explicate this relation. After\nfinding traditional philosophical accounts of emergence to be inappropriate, I\ndevelop a new conception of emergence by considering physical case studies\nincluding condensed matter physics, hydrodynamics, critical phenomena and\nquantum field theory understood as effective field theory.\n  This new conception of emergence is independent of reduction and derivation.\nInstead, a low-energy theory is understood as emergent from a high-energy\ntheory if it is novel and autonomous compared to the high-energy theory, and\nthe low-energy physics is dependent (in a particular, minimal sense) on the\nhigh-energy physics (this dependence is revealed by the techniques of effective\nfield theory and the renormalisation group). These ideas are important in\nexploring the relationship between quantum gravity and GR, where GR is\nunderstood as an effective, low-energy theory of quantum gravity. Without\nexperimental data or a theory of quantum gravity, we rely on principles and\ntechniques from other areas of physics to guide the way. As well as considering\nthe idea of emergence appropriate to treating GR as an effective field theory,\nI investigate the emergence of spacetime (and other aspects of GR) in several\nconcrete approaches to quantum gravity, including examples of the condensed\nmatter approaches, the \"discrete approaches\" (causal set theory, causal\ndynamical triangulations, quantum causal histories and quantum graphity) and\nloop quantum gravity.\n",

The main contribution\nof this discussion is to emphasize the pragmatic elements in the derivation.\nMore specifically: (1) Probability theory is designed as the uniquely natural\ntool for representing states of incomplete information. (2) An epistemic notion\nof information is defined in terms of its relation to the Bayesian beliefs of\nideally rational agents. (3) The method of updating from a prior to a posterior\nprobability distribution is designed through an eliminative induction process\nthat singles out the logarithmic relative entropy as the unique tool for\ninference. The resulting framework includes as special cases both MaxEnt and\nBayes' rule. It therefore unifies entropic and Bayesian methods into a single\ngeneral inference scheme. I find that similar pragmatic elements are an\nintegral part of Putnam's internal realism, of Floridi's informational\nstructural realism, and also of van Fraasen's empiricist structuralism. I\nconclude with the conjecture that their valuable insights can be incorporated\ninto a single coherent doctrine - an informational pragmatic realism.\n",

The branch of the Cantoni family, on\nMichele's mother's side, rather ignored by now, played a crucial role: with\nVittorio Cantoni, a renowned electrical engineer who had not been previously\nidentified as being Michele's uncle, and Giuseppe Jung, professor at the Milan\nPolitecnico.

The wave theory of light is so deeply rooted that it has\nbeen--and currently is--applied to describe phenomena in which the fundamental\nentities at work are discrete (photons). The fact that the wave theory of light\ncan describe one aspect of these phenomena can not overshadow two issues: the\ncorpuscular theory of light, firstly applied to the Doppler effect for photons\nby Schr\\\"odinger in 1922, is by far more complete since it describes all the\nfeatures of the studied phenomena; the wave theory can be used only when the\nnumber of photons at work is statistically significant. The disregard of basic\nmethodological criteria may appear as a minor fault. However, the historical\ndevelopment of quantum physics shows that the predominance of the wave theory\nof radiation, beyond its natural application domain, has hampered the\nreorientation toward the photon description of the underlying phenomena.\n",

He decided not to publish it after having\nreceived the new results by Sommerfeld in Munich. Two years later, Bohr\npublished \"On the quantum theory of line-spectra.\" There, the adiabatic\nhypothesis played an important role, although it appeared with another name:\nthe principle of mechanical transformability. In the subsequent variations of\nhis theory, Bohr never suppressed this principle completely. We discuss the\nrole of Ehrenfest's principle in the works of Bohr, paying special attention to\nits relation to the correspondence principle.

In that paper, the flying atom was conceived as a flying clock:\nthe reference to the Doppler effect was only indirect (the experiments by Stark\nto the first order of $v/c$). In 1922, Schr\\\"odinger showed that the emission\nof a light quantum by a (flying) atom is regulated by the conservation laws of\nenergy and linear momentum. Therefore, the Doppler effect for photons is the\nconsequence of the energy and momentum exchange between the atom and the\nphoton: a central role is played by the quantum energy jump $\\Delta E$ of the\ntransition (a relativistic invariant). The first realization of the experiment\ndevised by Einstein is due to Ives and Stilwell (1938). Since then till\nnowadays experiments of this kind have been repeated in search of better\nprecision and/or a deviation from the predictions of special relativity. The\nstriking feature is that all the papers dealing with these experiments\ncompletely neglect Schr\\\"odinger's dynamical treatment. The origins of this\nomission are of different kind: pragmatic (agreement between formulas, wherever\ncoming from, and experiments), historical (deep rooting of the wave theory of\nlight) and epistemological (neglect of basic epistemological rules).\n",

Then, a\ncombined journal is described, detailing significant events. In additional to a\nbiographical sketch, comments by various authors are compared and contrasted\nconcerning two narratives: firstly, the sequence of events that happened and\nthe couples relationship at particular times. Secondly, the contents of letters\nfrom both Einstein and Mileva. Some interpretations of the usage of pronouns in\nthose letters during 1899 and 1905 are re-examined, and a different hypothesis\nregarding the usage of those pronouns is introduced. Various papers are\nexamined and the content of each subsequent paper is compared to the work that\nMileva was performing. With a different take, this treatment further suggests\nthat the couple continued to work together much longer than other authors have\nindicated. We also evaluate critics and supporters of the hypothesis that\nMileva was involved in Einsteins work, and refocus this within a historical\ncontext, in terms of women in science in the late 19th century. Finally, the\ndefinition of, collaboration (co-authorship, specifically) is outlined. As a\nresult, recommendations are stated, the first of which is that Mileva should be\nseriously considered as an honorary co-author of one, possibly two, papers, and\nsecondly, of which it is recommended that a serious inquiry should be made,\nconcerning the extent of Mileva Mari\\'cs involvement in Albert Einsteins\npublished works between 1902 and 1905.\n",

I discuss the possible connection between the 1912 rotating\ndisk problem and the Hole Argument and the connection between the 1916 rotating\ndisk problem and the Point Coincident Argument. Finally, according to Mach's\nideas we see that the possibility of an empty hole is unacceptable.

In this essay I explore the possibility\nthat rather than being an odd coincidence arising due to our strange position\nas passive (and even more strangely, conscious) observers in the cosmos, these\ntwo problems might be related and could be explainable in terms of fundamental\nphysics. The perspective presented suggests a potential unified framework\nwhere, when taken together, comprehenders and comprehensibility are part of\ncausal structure of physical reality, which is considered as a causal graph\n(network) connecting states that are physically possible. I argue that in some\nlocal regions, the most probable states are those that include physical systems\nwhich contain information encodings - such as mathematics, language and art -\nbecause these are the most highly connected to other possible states in this\ncausal graph. Such physical systems include life and - of particular interest\nfor the discussion of the place of math in physical reality - comprehenders\ncapable of making mathematical sense of the world. Within this framework, the\ndescent of math is an undirected outcome of the evolution of the universe,\nwhich will tend toward states that are increasingly connected to other possible\nstates of the universe, a process greatly facilitated if some physical systems\nknow the rules of the game. I therefore conclude that our ability to use\nmathematics to describe, and more importantly manipulate, the natural world may\nnot be an anomaly or trick, but instead could provide clues to the underlying\ncausal structure of physical reality.\n",

We\nanalyze this issue from a sober perspective.

In fact, fine-tuning and Design even seem to be at odds with\neach other, whereas the inference from fine-tuning to a Multiverse only works\nif the latter is underwritten by an additional metaphysical hypothesis we\nconsider unwarranted. Instead, we suggest that fine-tuning requires no special\nexplanation at all, since it is not the Universe that is fine-tuned for life,\nbut life that has been fine-tuned to the Universe.\n",

First we analyze basic properties\nof the SBs such as the time-dependent distribution, author characteristics\n(names of authors, country, institution), as well as the journals and fields of\nthe SBs are analyzed. Next we develop a new approach in which the cognitive\nenvironment of the SBs is analyzed, based on the mapping of Sleeping Beauties\nusing their citation links and conceptual relations, particularly co-citation\nmapping. In this way we investigate the research themes in which the SBs are\nused and possible causes of why the premature work in the SBs becomes topical,\ni.e., the trigger of the awakening of the SBs. This approach is tested with a\nblue skies SB and an application-oriented SB. We think that the mapping\nprocedures discussed in this paper are not only important for bibliometric\nanalyses.

The essential behavior\nof physical phenomena can be expressed by mathematical laws, providing\ndescriptions and predictions. In the present essay I argue that, although\nmathematics can be seen, in a first approach, as a language, it goes beyond\nthis concept. I conjecture that mathematics presents two extreme features,\ndenoted here by {\\sl irreducibility} and {\\sl insaturation}, representing\ndelimiters for self-referentiality. These features are then related to physical\nlaws by realizing that nature is a self-referential system obeying bounds\nsimilar to those respected by mathematics. Self-referential systems can only be\nautonomous entities by a kind of metabolism that provides and sustains such an\nautonomy. A rational mind, able of consciousness, is a manifestation of the\nself-referentiality of the Universe. Hence mathematics is here proposed to go\nbeyond language by actually representing the most fundamental existence\ncondition for self-referentiality. This idea is synthesized in the form of a\nprinciple, namely, that {\\sl mathematics is the ultimate tactics of\nself-referential systems to mimic themselves}. That is, well beyond an\neffective language to express the physical world, mathematics uncovers a deep\nmanifestation of the autonomous nature of the Universe, wherein the human brain\nis but an instance.\n",

However, this\nwas not an inevitable development from the relationships among its countries.\nIndeed, regional rivalries between Brazil and Argentina, with military\nimplications for both countries, lasted a long time. After WWII these countries\ntook part in the race to obtain nuclear technologies and nuclear ambitions were\npart of the game. In the mid 1980s, the end of military dictatorships and the\nsuccessful establishing of democratic institutions put an end to the race. Thus\nregional and national interests in addition to the establishment of democracies\nin Latin America have been responsible for the building of trust between the\ntwo countries. Meaningful international initiatives are once again needed in\nthe framework of worldwide cooperation. This cooperation is better developed\nwhen democratic regimes are in place.\n",

From\nthese assumptions, conclusions can be drawn regarding the laws of physics in\nany one frame. Can we do the reverse, that is, build the correct physics\nentirely from considerations within a single frame and infer therefrom the\nresults of measurements in moving frames? Can we, in this project, supply the\n\"elementary foundations\" that Einstein found lacking in his own theory, thereby\nconverting special relativity from (in Einstein's terminology) a \"principle\"\ntheory to a \"constructive\" one? Expanding on the approach suggested by Johns S.\nBell, this paper demonstrates that we can progress toward those goals via the\nintroduction of elementary quantum concepts, particularly the idea of matter\nwaves (deBroglie waves) that was unknown to Einstein in 1905. This quantum\ndynamical approach offers to resolve a recent dispute in philosophy of physics\nregarding the Minkowski geometry of spacetime.\n",

The main\nchallenge for this view is to explain how mathematical theories can become\nincreasingly abstract and develop their own internal structure, whilst still\nmaintaining an appropriate empirical tether that can explain their later use in\nphysics. In order to address this, I offer a theory of mathematical\ntheory-building based on the idea that human knowledge has the structure of a\nscale-free network and that abstract mathematical theories arise from a\nrepeated process of replacing strong analogies with new hubs in this network.\nThis allows mathematics to be seen as the study of regularities, within\nregularities, within ..., within regularities of the natural world. Since\nmathematical theories are derived from the natural world, albeit at a much\nhigher level of abstraction than most other scientific theories, it should come\nas no surprise that they so often show up in physics.\n  This version of the essay contains an addendum responding to Slyvia\nWenmackers' essay and comments that were made on the FQXi website.\n",

We\ncritically review several celestial observations from AD 757 to the end of the\n770s, most of which were previously considered to be true, and in some cases,\nstrong aurorae; we discuss in detail the East Asian records and their wording.\nWe conclude that probably none among the events after AD 770 was actually an\naurora, including the event in AD 776 Jan, which was misdated for AD 774 or\n775; the observed white qi phenomenon that happened \"above the moon\" in the\nsouth-east was most probably a halo effect near the full moon - too late in any\ncase to be related to the 14C variation in AD 774/5. There is another report of\na similar (or identical) white qi phenomenon \"above the moon\", reported just\nbefore a comet observation and dated to AD 776 Jan; the reported comet observed\nby the Chinese was misdated to AD 776, but actually sighted in AD 767.

The sign polyline has been interpreted as an analog of graphic of\nequation of time in which the testimony of a water clock correspond with\naverage solar time, and the testimony of a sundial - the true solar time. Sign\nwheel has been interpreted as a complex of lines, reflecting the regularity\nchanging the direction of the shadows from the gnomon at sunset at the\nequinoxes and solstices. The sign thin polyline has been interpreted as a\nsymbol of change of height of the Sun in the meridian at the equinoxes and\nsolstices.

We argue that change is\nontologically and epistemologically a more basic phenomenon than time. Time is\nan abstract entity created by the human mind on the basis of the experience of\nchange. Physical reality is a process of ceaseless becoming and vanishing; time\nis not a part of that process. Time is the abstract bank in relation to which\nwe measure the intensity and amount of the flow (change) of physical reality.\nWe must differentiate physical reality from abstract entities (language) by\nmeans of which we speak about this reality. It is necessary to differentiate a\nformal description (formulas) from its interpretation: a correct formal\ndescription can be interpreted in a logically inconsistent and factually wrong\nway. We argue that the discourse about the relativity of time joins (mixes)\nphysical reality and language, and gives an inconsistent interpretation of\ncorrect formulas. Regarding the future of time, it has been said that\nphysicists are divided between two options: (1) to pin down a \"master time\", as\na measure of change of physical reality, and (2) to proclaim time \"out of\nexistence\". We argue that both options must be adopted, because time is (1) a\nmeasure of change, created by the human mind, (2) and time is an abstract\nentity that does not exist in physical reality.\n",

This is based on the fact that a natural law\nin a platonic metaphysics represents a timeless order in the motion of matter,\nwhile a natural law in a materialistic metaphysics can be only defined as a\ntemporary order which appears at random in the chaotic motion of matter.\nAlthough a logical possibility, one can argue that this type of metaphysics is\nhighly implausible. Given that mathematics fits naturally within platonism, we\nconclude that a platonic metaphysics is more preferable than a materialistic\nmetaphysics.\n",

Under this precondition an own model to derive\nthe mathematical structure of general relativity from a unified quantum field\ntheory of spinors is developed. In addition the quantum theory of fundamental\nbinary logical alternatives, which has been conceived by Carl Friedrich von\nWeizs\\\"acker in the second half of the twentieth century and in which the\nexistence of physical space and his properties is a consequence of quantum\ntheory, is treated elaborately and considered with respect to the question of\nthe unification of quantum theory and general relativity.\n",

The\nconstants of nature, which he claimed to be able to deduce purely\ntheoretically, were of particular significance to his project.

The initial aim of the two\ncountries was to search for evidence of cosmic rays being emitted by the\nsupernova in a project named JANZOS. A large cosmic ray detector was installed\nnear the summit of the Black Birch range in Marlborough to monitor the\nsupernova but, after seven years of operations, the results proved to be\nnegative. In 1994 a second phase of research was commenced, this time at the Mt\nJohn University Observatory in Canterbury under the emblem MOA. The aim of the\nMOA project is to study dark matter and extrasolar planets using a novel\ngravitational microlensing technique. A 1.8m telescope was built at the\nobservatory, and several planets were subsequently found. Some have exotic\nproperties, the most exotic being a new class of free-floating planets that\nappear not to be orbiting stars. They are estimated to outnumber stars by about\ntwo to one. In this article the work carried out by the JANZOS and MOA\ncollaborations is reviewed, and plans for the future are outlined.\n",

We\nconcentrate on formal systems not only for the sake of showing how there is a\nfundamental mathematical structure to biology, but also to consider and\nreconsider philosophical and phenomenological points of view in relation to\nnatural science and mathematics. The relationship with phenomenology comes\nabout in the questions that arise about the nature of the observer in relation\nto the observed that arise in philosophy, but also in science in the very act\nof determining the context and models upon which it shall be based.We examine\nthe schema behind the reproduction of DNA. The DNA molecule consists of two\ninterwound strands, the Watson Strand (W) and the Crick Strand (C). The two\nstrands are bonded to each other via a backbone of base-pairings and these\nbonds can be broken by certain enzymes present in the cell. In reproduction of\nDNA the bonds between the two strands are broken and the two strands then\nacquire the needed complementary base molecules from the cellular environment\nto reconstitute each a separate copy of the DNA. At this level the situation\ncan be described by a symbolism like this. DNA = <W|C> -------> <W| E |C>\n--------> <W| |C><W| |C> = <W|C><W|C> = DNA DNA. Here E stands for the\nenvironment of the cell. The first arrow denotes the separation of the DNA into\nthe two strands.

By\n1873 they had given definition to the electromagnetic system of units (emu) and\ndefined the practical units of the ohm as ${10}^9$ emu units of resistance and\nthe volt as ${10}^8$ emu units of electromotive force. These recommendations\nwere ratified and expanded upon in a series of international congresses held\nbetween 1881 and 1904. A proposal by Giovanni Giorgi in 1901 took advantage of\na coincidence between the conversion of the units of energy in the emu system\n(the erg) and in the practical system (the joule) in that the same conversion\nfactor existed between the cgs based emu system and a theretofore undefined MKS\nsystem. By introducing another unit, X (where X could be any of the practical\nelectrical units), Giorgi demonstrated that a self consistent MKSX system was\ntenable without the need for multiplying factors. Ultimately the ampere was\nselected as the fourth unit. It took nearly 60 years, but in 1960 Giorgi's\nproposal was incorporated as the core of the newly inaugurated International\nSystem of Units (SI). This article surveys the physics, physicists and events\nthat contributed to those developments.\n",

Gill abandoned a successful career as a clock and watchmaker.\nHis speciality was in astrometry, an area of astronomy of both practical and\nscientific importance that tended to be eclipsed in the 20th century by the\nrise of astrophysics. As Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope for\n27 years, David Gill was admired for his prolific contribution to highly\naccurate and trustworthy results. David Gill's collaboration was desired by\nleading astronomers of the day and he was the only southern hemisphere\nrepresentative on the hugely important Conference Internationale des Etoiles\nFondamentales of 1896. He created with Jacobus Kapteyn the first extensive star\ncatalogue derived from photographic plates (the CPD), including over 450,000\nstars. He was an initiator of the biggest multi-national and multi-observatory\nproject of the century, taking on the role of President of the International\nCommission overseeing the Carte du Ciel project. David Gill raised the Cape of\nGood Hope observatory from a rather run-down jobbing observatory of the\nAdmiralty to the best observatory in the Southern hemisphere. He acquired in\nthe process the reputation of an expert in precision instrument design. He also\nmade a substantial name for himself as semi-official director of the geodetic\nsurvey of South Africa. Overall David Gill was highly influential, respected\nand well liked. With the resurgence of interest in astrometry, the contribution\nof David Gill to astronomy is due for a re-assessment a century after he died.\n",

A recent alternative formulation of Newtonian gravity due\nto Saunders (Philosophy of Science 80 (2013) pp.22-48) provides a conceptually\nsatisfactory cosmology but fails to reproduce the Newtonian limit of general\nrelativity in homogenous but anisotropic universes.

This means following the\nelectron's path on its way from a cylindrical cathode moving toward a co-axial\ncylindrical anode in presence of a uniform magnetic field parallel to the\ncommon axis. After analyzing the situation without coupling to an external\noscillatory electric field, we employ methods of canonical perturbation theory\nto find the resonance condition between the frequencies of the free theory w_r,\nw_phi and the applied perturbing oscillatory frequency w. A long-time averaging\nprocess will then eliminate the periodic terms in the equation for the now\ntime-dependent action-angle variables. The terms that are no longer periodic\nwill cause secular changes so that the canonical action-angle variables (J,\ndelta) change in a way that the path of the electron will deform gradually so\nthat it can reach the anode. How the ensemble of the initially randomly\ndistributed electrons forms spokes and how their energy is conveyed to the\ncavity-field oscillation is the main focus of this article. Some remarks\nconcerning the importance of results in QED and the invention of radar theory\nand application conclude the article.\n",

The split at\nthe sphere of the moon has been definitely overcome through the observation of\na supernova and several comets by Tycho Brahe. The second distinction was\neradicated by Isaak Newton who showed that gravitational motion was caused by a\nforce proportional to the inverse square of the distance. By the theory of\nGeneral Relativity, Albert Einstein showed that there is no gravitational force\nbut motion under gravity (i.e. Aristotles <natural motion>) is caused by the\ncurved geometry of spacetime. In this way, the Aristotelian distinction between\nnatural motion and enforced motion has come back in the form of two great\ntheories: General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory which are today\nincompatible.

A prime example of this is the\ncurrent parallel universes or multiverse theory, which has the support of a\nnumber of famous cosmologists. In this article, we contend that the claim for\nthe existence of those parallel universes, as presented in Max Tegmark's book\n\"Our Mathematical Universe\", rests crucially on some questionable probability\narguments involving infinity. As a result, a doubt is cast over the multiverse\nhypothesis: Is it more credible than the counterarguments based on\nphilosophical and metaphysical considerations?\n",

Persian astrologer and\nastronomer Abu Mashar: Dixit Albumasar, Cometa supra Venerem visus fuit, i.e.\nthat he had reported much earlier that comets were seen beyond Venus. However,\neven from a more detailed Latin translation, the observations and logic behind\nAbu Mashar's conclusion were not understandable. We present here the original\nArabic text (MS Ankara, Saib 199) together with our translation and\ninterpretation: Abu Mashar reported that he had observed Venus in (or projected\nonto) the tail of a comet and concluded that the comet was behind Venus,\nbecause he had observed the extinction of Venus due to the cometary tail to be\nnegligible (light of Venus was unimpaired). He then concluded that the comet\nwould be located behind Venus. He also mentioned that others had observed\nJupiter and Saturn in cometary tails, so that those comets would even be\nlocated beyond those two outer planets - in the sphere of the stars. The dates\nof the observed close conjunctions were not mentioned; using known orbital\nelements for a few comets, we found a few close conjunctions between comets and\nplanets from A.D. 770 to 868, but we cannot be sure regarding which\nconjunctions were reported. While the argument of Abu Mashar is not correct (as\ncometary tails are optically thin), parts of the conclusion - namely that\ncomets are outside the Earth atmosphere and beyond the moon - is correct. This\nmay have helped Tycho Brahe to come to his revolutionary conclusion.\n",

One way to extract such predictions is from\ntheory-generated probability distributions that allow for selection\neffects---generally expressed in terms of assumptions about anthropic\nconditionalization and how typical we are. In this paper, I urge three lessons\nabout typicality in multiverse settings. (i) Because it is difficult to\ncharacterize our observational situation in the multiverse, we cannot assume\nthat we are typical (as in the 'principle of mediocrity'): nor can we ignore\nthe issue of typicality, for it has a measurable impact on predictions for our\nobservations. (ii) There are spectra of assumptions about both\nconditionalization and typicality, which lead to coincident predictions for our\nobservations, leading to problems of confirmation in multiverse cosmology. And\nmoreover, (iii) when one has the freedom to consider competing theories of the\nmultiverse, the assumption of typicality may not lead to the highest\nlikelihoods for our observations. These three entwined aspects of typicality\nimply that positive assertions about our typicality, such as the 'principle of\nmediocrity', are more questionable than has been recently claimed.\n",

A different and more\nsuccessful version of gravitation-to-heat energy conversion was proposed by H.\nHelmholtz in 1854 and further developed by W. Thomson.

The SGE was the first fully successful molecular beam experiment\nwith high momentum-resolution by beam measurements in vacuum. This technique\nprovided a new kinematic microscope with which inner atomic or nuclear\nproperties could be investigated.\n  The original SGE is described together with early attempts by Einstein,\nEhrenfest, Heisenberg, and others to understand directional quantization in the\nSGE. Heisenberg's and Einstein's proposals of an improved multi-stage SGE are\npresented. The first realization of these proposals by Stern, Phipps, Frisch\nand Segr\\`e is described. The set-up suggested by Einstein can be considered an\nanticipation of a Rabi-apparatus. Recent theoretical work is mentioned in which\nthe directional quantization process and possible interference effects of the\ntwo different spin states are investigated.\n  In full agreement with the results of the new quantum theory directional\nquantization appears as a general and universal feature of quantum\nmeasurements.

The hypothesis of reductionism finds\nno obstacle within contemporary natural sciences. Determinism in classical\nphysics is irrefutable, unless classical physics is itself refuted. From\nquantum mechanics, some authors argue that free will is possible because there\nis an ontological indeterminism in the natural laws, and that the mind is\nresponsible for the wave function collapse of matter, which leads to a choice\namong the different possibilities for the body. However, here I defend the\nopposite thesis because indeterminism does not imply free will, and because the\nconsiderations about an autonomous mind sending orders to the body is against\nneuroscience or evolutionary theories about human beings. The quantum theory of\nmeasurement can be interpreted without the intervention of human minds, but\nother fields of science cannot contemplate the mentalist scenario.

From the algebraic point of\nview, the set of observables of a physical system, be it classical or quantum,\nis described by a \\emph{Jordan-Lie algebra}. From the geometric point of view,\nthe space of states of any system is described by a \\emph{uniform Poisson space\nwith transition probability}. Both these structures are here perceived as\nformal translations of \\emph{the fundamental twofold role of properties in\nMechanics}: they are at the same time quantities and transformations. The\nquestion becomes then to understand the precise articulation between these two\nroles. The analysis will show that Quantum Mechanics can be thought as\ndistinguishing itself from Classical Mechanics by a compatibility condition\nbetween properties-as-quantities and properties-as-transformations.\n  Moreover, this dissertation shows the existence of a tension between a\ncertain \"abstract way\" of conceiving mathematical structures, used in the\npractice of mathematical physics, and the necessary capacity to specify\nparticular states or observables. It then becomes important to understand how,\nwithin the formalism, one can construct a \\emph{labelling scheme}. The \"Chase\nfor Individuation\" is the analysis of different mathematical techniques which\nattempt to overcome this tension. In particular, we discuss how group theory\nfurnishes a partial solution.\n",

However, all the astronomical answers have detailed\nrefutations, and general disproofs, so all the astronomical answers for the\nStar are dead.\n  In 1999, Michael Molnar put forth a completely new solution, where the Star\noriginated as a report of a natal horoscope for 17 April 6 BC. This natal\nhoroscope shows very impressive regal portents and points to Judea. It is very\nimprobable that such a very rare planet configuration (averaging only once per\nmillennium or longer) would coincide with the very restricted day of Jesus'\nbirth (springtime in a year shortly before Herod's death in 4 BC), unless there\nis some causal connection. The Magi (as labeled by the gospel author) were\nastrologers, so they were only interested in horoscopes. The astrological\nsolution is further supported by the presence of an astrological technical term\n('in the east' meaning what astronomers call the 'heliacal rise') in the\nNativity narrative of Matthew. Importantly, Molnar has only identified the Star\nas originating from a particular natal horoscope, while making no statement\nabout the nature or historicity of any of the other elements of the story in\nMatthew. So for example, the Magi might be astrologers as idealized by the\nGreeks of the time, or they might have been non-existent (invented by a\nlatter-day Greek seeking omens for the birth of a great king), and they might\nhave arrived on 17 April 6 BC or months later, and they might or might not have\nbeen three in numbers with given names. But for the Star of Bethlehem alone,\nMolnar's astrological solution is convincing.\n",

The desire to construct a tool with which it\nwas possible to build a \"dial\" for analemmatic sundial for different latitude\nup to the latitude of the North Pole could appear under the influence of the\ndominant mythological ideas about sacred geography of the surrounding world in\nwhich the North is the World Mountain, World Tree or the abode of the gods. In\nthe article the authors conclude that the petroglyph \"tree\" on Varvarinsky slab\nmarks the direction to the North as a projection of the North Pole of the world\non the earth's surface, which simulates the slab. Petroglyph is an image of an\ninverted World Tree, when viewed from the gnomon / man.

Its goals are to assert\nthat the universe is fine-tuned for life, to defend that this fact can\nreasonably motivate further scientific inquiry as to why it is so, and to show\nthat the multiverse and intelligent design hypotheses are reasonable proposals\nto explain this fine-tuning.

For example, the parameters of the standard model of particle\nphysics are \"unnaturally\" small (in various technical senses), which has driven\nmuch of the search for physics beyond the standard model. Of particular\ninterest is the fine-tuning of the universe for life, which suggests that our\nuniverse's ability to create physical life forms is improbable and in need of\nexplanation, perhaps by a multiverse. This claim has been challenged on the\ngrounds that the relevant probability measure cannot be justified because it\ncannot be normalized, and so small probabilities cannot be inferred. We show\nhow fine-tuning can be formulated within the context of Bayesian theory testing\n(or \\emph{model selection}) in the physical sciences. The normalizability\nproblem is seen to be a general problem for testing any theory with free\nparameters, and not a unique problem for fine-tuning. Physical theories in fact\navoid such problems in one of two ways. Dimensional parameters are bounded by\nthe Planck scale, avoiding troublesome infinities, and we are not compelled to\nassume that dimensionless parameters are distributed uniformly, which avoids\nnon-normalizability.\n",

It was presented at the public meeting of the St.Petersburg\nAcademy of Sciences in November 1753 and is traditionally listed among\nLomonosov's most important scientific accomplishments. In the Discourse,\nLomonosov presents an original theory of generation of electricity in the air\nand lightning, many elements of which are profoundly correct even by present\nday understanding of the phenomenon. The theory is based on experimental\nobservations and measurements and supported by some mathematical estimates. The\nbasis of the Lomonosov theory is the idea of vertical air movements as the main\ncause of atmospheric electricity - the immersion of the cold upper strata of\nthe atmosphere into the lower (warmer) layers causes mechanical friction of\nminiscular particles in the air against each other, that results in generation\nof atmospheric electricity. Miniscular particles of two types are required:\nthose of water (vapors) capable of accumulation of the electricity, and organic\ncompounds/fatty particles in the air which are involved in production of the\nelectricity via friction. Electrically charged droplets are assumed to be\nspread throughout the entire volume of the cloud. The transfer of charges from\nindividual fatty particles to droplets of water in the clouds via countless\ncollisions leads to formation in atmosphere, in clouds of strong electric\nfields, which are the cause of the appearance of lightning. At the end of\nDiscourse Lomonosov suggests explanations of the Northern lights (aurora\nborealis) and comet tails as purely electrical phenomena originating from the\ndown- and updrafts in the atmospheres, like in his theory of lightning,and\nexpanding beyond them into the surrounding ether.\n",

This simple definition has multiple consequences:\n-The context dependence of the notion of symmetry is evident in the humanities\nbut by no means irrelevant yet often neglected in science. The subtle\nproblematic of concept formation and the ontological status of similarities\nopens up. -In general, the substitutions underlying the concept of symmetry are\nnot really performed but remain in a state of virtuality. Counterfactuality,\nfreedom and creativity come into focus. The detection of previously hidden\nsymmetries may provide deep and surprising insights. -Related to this, due\nattention is devoted to the aesthetic dimension of symmetry and the breaking of\nit. -Finally, we point out to what extent life is based on the interplay\nbetween order and freedom, between full and broken symmetry.\n",

In\naddition to Aristotle's wide-ranging philosophical concerns, his theory arose\nfrom the observation in everyday life that if an object is moving something\nmust be moving it. This idea works very well for the horse and cart but is\npuzzling if you apply it to a thrown stone or spear. Problems with Aristotle's\ntheory of projectile motion were identified by one or two people between his\ntime and the 14th century, particularly John Philoponus (6th century AD) and\nJohn Buridan (14th century AD). An archer or a spearman does not need a theory\nof projectile motion, just a great deal of practice. But once the gun was\ninvented it became important to know what angle a barrel should be oriented at\nand how much propellant to use, particularly as gunpowder was expensive.\nHowever, for many years afterwards the manufacturing techniques used meant that\ncannonballs were a loose fit to gun-barrels making cannons both inaccurate and\nof poor reproducibility shot-to-shot. Also air resistance makes the trajectory\nboth impossible to calculate and qualitatively similar to theories based on\nAristotle's writings. It was not until Galileo and Newton worked on the problem\nthat a better theory of ideal projectile motion was arrived at.\n",

Our analysis of quantum mechanics will naturally lead us to the\nnotion of a hidden reality and to the postulate that consciousness is an\nintegral component of this reality. The framework proposed in the paper\nprovides the philosophical underpinnings for a theory of consciousness while\nsatisfactorily resolving the interpretation problem in quantum mechanics\nwithout the need to alter its mathematical structure.

The issue of\nconfirmation for an entire framework (e.g, Newtonian mechanics en bloc, as\nopposed, say, to Newton's theory of gravitation) either does not arise, or is\ndismissed in so far as frameworks are thought not to be the kind of thing that\nadmits scientific confirmation. I argue that there is another form of\nscientific reasoning that has not received philosophical attention, what I call\n'Newtonian abduction', that does provide confirmation for frameworks as a\nwhole, and does so in two novel ways. (In particular, Newtonian abduction is\nnot inference to the best explanation, but rather is closer to Peirce's\noriginal idea of abduction.) I further argue that Newtonian abduction is at\nleast as important a form of reasoning in science as standard deductive and\ninductive forms. The form is beautifully summed up by Maxwell (1876): \"The true\nmethod of physical reasoning is to begin with the phenomena and to deduce the\nforces from them by a direct application of the equations of motion.\"\n",

Based on the analysis of experimental data, mainly\npho-tographic observations of nebulae in the Milky Way and extragalactic\nsystems, he made conclu-sions and suggested well-founded hypotheses on a wide\nrange of the considered problems, in-cluding those related to cosmogony. The\nstructure of nebulae, their masses and sizes give a reason to the conclusion\nthat most of them are formed not in the process of ejection of matter from the\nstars, but this is the objects, which are born and evolved, and quite often\ncomprised in giant conglomerates of gas, dust and stars. The distribution of\nO-stars and nebulae in spiral branches points to their genetic relation and the\nfundamental role of the interstellar medium as a source of their formation. The\nstructural features of nebulae are determined by the action of\nmagnetohydrodynamic forces. Magnetic fields in a galaxy control the motion of\ndiffuse gas-dust matter and ensure the maintenance of its spiral structure.\nThese ideas continue being developed in modern directions of astrophysics.\n",

However, what information we do have tells\nus that Aboriginal people were close observers of planets and their motions,\nnoting the relative brightness of the planets, their motions along the\necliptic, retrograde motion, the relationship between Venus and its proximity\nto the Sun, Venus' connection to the Sun through zodiacal light, and the\nsynodic cycle of Venus, particularly as it transitions from the Evening Star to\nthe Morning Star. The dearth of descriptions of planets in Aboriginal\ntraditions may be due to the gross incompleteness of recorded astronomical\ntraditions, and of ethnographic bias and misidentification in the\nanthropological record. Ethnographic fieldwork with Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander communities is revealing new, previously unrecorded knowledge\nabout the planets and their related phenomena.\n",

It is based on\nquestionnaires and interviews made shortly before and shortly after the\ndiscovery in 2012. We show, to begin with, that the discovery of a Standard\nModel (SM) Higgs boson was less expected than is sometimes assumed. Once the\nnew particle was shown to have properties consistent with SM expectations -\nalbeit with significant experimental uncertainties -, there was a broad\nagreement that 'a' Higgs boson had been found. Physicists adopted a twopronged\nstrategy. On the one hand, they treated the particle as a SM Higgs boson and\ntried to establish its properties with higher precision; on the other hand,\nthey searched for any hints of physics beyond the SM. This motivates our first\nphilosophical thesis: the Higgs discovery, being of fundamental importance and\nestablishing a new kind of particle, represented a crucial experiment if one\ninterprets this notion in an appropriate sense. By embedding the LHC into\nthetradition of previous precision experiments and the experimental strategies\nthus established, Duhemian underdetermination is kept at bay. Second, our case\nstudy suggests that criteria of theory (or model) preference should be\nunderstood as epistemic and pragmatic values that have to be weighed in factual\nresearch practice. The Higgs discovery led to a shift from pragmatic to\nepistemic values as regards the mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking.\nComplex criteria, such as naturalness, combine epistemic and pragmatic values,\nbut are coherently applied by the community.\n",

Part III considers some of what happened to Einstein, his theory of\ngravity, and related science after the war and, perhaps, because of it.

Others perhaps less so, including a flood of books about GR (pro and\ncon) with the end of paper rationing surely playing a role, AE's 1922 trip to\nParis, and the gory details, swings and roundabouts of gravitational\nradiation/waves and the cosmological constant.

For it\nis claimed that, in certain theories of quantum gravity, spacetime\n'disappears': and this suggests that one may have sensible physical theories in\nwhich spacetime is completely absent. This makes the philosophical question\nwhether such theories are intelligible, even more pressing. And if such\ntheories are intelligible, the question then is how they manage to do so. In\nthis paper, we adapt the contextual theory of scientific understanding,\ndeveloped by one of us, to fit the novel challenges posed by physical theories\nwithout spacetime. We construe understanding as a matter of skill rather than\njust knowledge. The appeal is thus to understanding, rather than explanation,\nbecause we will be concerned with the tools that scientists have at their\ndisposal for understanding these theories. Our central thesis is that such\nphysical theories can provide scientific understanding, and that such\nunderstanding does not require spacetimes of any sort. Our argument consists of\nfour consecutive steps: (a) We argue, from the general theory of scientific\nunderstanding, that although visualization is an oft-used tool for\nunderstanding, it is not a necessary condition for it; (b) we criticise certain\nmetaphysical preconceptions which can stand in the way of recognising how\nintelligibility without spacetime can be had; (c) we catalogue tools for\nrendering theories without a spacetime intelligible; and (d) we give examples\nof cases in which understanding is attained without a spacetime, and explain\nwhat kind of understanding these examples provide.\n",

One influential formulation of the principle, which\nprohibits fine tuning of bare Standard Model (SM) parameters, rests on the\nassumption that a particular set of values for these parameters constitute the\n\"fundamental parameters\" of the theory, and serve to mathematically define the\ntheory. On the other hand, an old argument by Wetterich suggests that fine\ntuning of bare parameters merely reflects an arbitrary, inconvenient choice of\nexpansion parameters and that the choice of parameters in an EFT is therefore\narbitrary. We argue that these two interpretations of Higgs fine tuning reflect\ndistinct ways of formulating and interpreting effective field theories (EFTs)\nwithin the Wilsonian framework: the first takes an EFT to be defined by a\nsingle set of physical, fundamental bare parameters, while the second takes a\nWilsonian EFT to be defined instead by a whole Wilsonian renormalization group\n(RG) trajectory, associated with a one-parameter class of physically equivalent\nparametrizations. From this latter perspective, no single parametrization\nconstitutes the physically correct, fundamental parametrization of the theory,\nand the delicate cancellation between bare Higgs mass and quantum corrections\nappears as an eliminable artifact of the arbitrary, unphysical reference scale\nwith respect to which the physical amplitudes of the theory are parametrized.\nWhile the notion of fundamental parameters is well motivated in the context of\ncondensed matter field theory, we explain why it may be superfluous in the\ncontext of high energy physics.\n",

        "summary": "  The relationship according to which one physical theory encompasses the\ndomain of empirical validity of another is widely known as \"reduction.\" Here it\nis argued that one popular methodology for showing that one theory reduces to\nanother, associated with the so-called \"Bronstein cube\" of physical theories,\nrests on an over-simplified characterization of the type of mathematical\nrelationship between theories that typically underpins reduction. An\nalternative methodology, based on a certain simple geometrical relationship\nbetween dis- tinct state space models of the same physical system, is then\ndescribed and illustrated with examples. Within this approach, it is shown how\nand under what conditions inter-model reductions involving distinct model pairs\ncan be composed or chained together to yield a direct reduction between\ntheoretically remote descriptions of the same system. Building on this\nanalysis, we consider cases in which a single reduction between two models may\nbe effected via distinct composite reductions differing in their intermediate\nlayer of description, and motivate a set of formal consistency requirements on\nthe mappings between model state spaces and on the subsets of the model state\nspaces that characterize such reductions. These constraints are explicitly\nshown to hold in the reduction of a non-relativistic classical model to a model\nof relativistic quantum mechanics, which may be effected via distinct composite\nreductions in which the intermediate layer of description is either a model of\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics or of relativistic classical mechanics. Some\nbrief speculations are offered as to whether and how this sort of consistency\nrequirement between distinct composite reductions might serve to constrain the\nrelationship that any unification of the Standard Model with general relativity\nmust bear to these theories.\n",

In this theory, although some disciplines are in a sense\n\"more fundamental\" than others, we never get to a \"most fundamental\"\ndiscipline.

Forbes wrote this survey of eighteenth- and\nnineteenth-century mathematical and physical sciences, in 1852-6, when British\n\"physics\" was at a pivotal point in its history, situated between a discipline\nidentified by its mathematical methods - originating in France - and one\nidentified by its university laboratory institutions. Contemporary\nencyclopaedias provided a nexus for publishers, the book trade, readers, and\nmen of science, in the formation of physics as a field. Forbes was both a\nwitness, whose account of the progress of physics or natural philosophy can be\nexplored at face value, and an agent, who exploited the opportunity offered by\nthe Encyclopaedia Britannica in the mid nineteenth-century to enrol the broadly\neducated public, and scientific collective, illuminating the connection between\nthe definition of physics and its forms of social practice. Forbes used the\nterms \"physics\" and \"natural philosophy\" interchangeably. He portrayed the\nfield as progressed by the natural genius of great men, who curated the\ndiscipline within an associational culture that engendered true intellectual\nspirit. Although this societal mechanism was becoming ineffective, Forbes did\nnot see university institutions as the way forward. Instead, running counter to\nhis friend William Whewell, he advocated inclusion of the mechanical arts\n(engineering), and a strictly limited role for mathematics. He revealed\ntensions when the widely accepted discovery-based historiography conflicted\nwith intellectual and moral worth, reflecting a nineteenth-century concern with\nspirit that cuts across twentieth-century questions about discipline and field.\n",

This multidisciplinary research\nrepresents a new reading of the historical-archaeological sources and the use\nof astronomy according to the Etruscan-Latin gromatica. By taking into\nconsideration the apparent motion of a True Sun, the possible measurement\nerrors, the atmospheric refraction and the elevation of the horizon, and the\nJulian date in use in astronomy, a numerical program has been elaborated to\ndefine the coincidences of the calendars between the azimuth of the main road\naxis and the course of the sun. For a series of very particular historical and\ncontextual conditions it was therefore possible to trace with sufficient\naccuracy the day and the year of foundation of the city: January 30, 9 BC,\nwhich coincides, not surprisingly, with a particularly important anniversary\nfor Ottaviano Augusto, Emperor from 27 BC to 14 AC. In fact, the astronomical\ndata interfaced with the archaeological, epigraphic and written sources suggest\nthat Turin was born at the end of the Alpine wars, concluded after the\nacquisition of the Valle di Susa and, more extensively, of the Maritime Alps,\nPennine and Graie. Founded as a colony along the road leading to the Gauls,\nAugusta Taurinorum was inaugurated on the day of the anniversary of the feast\nof Pax, established by Augustus and celebrated at the Ara Pacis in Rome\nstarting from 9 BC. The large marble altar of Campo Marzio was, as matter of\nfact, built to celebrate the end of civil wars and the beginning of a new era\n(confirmed also by the astrological/astronomical ephemerides of that time),\nwhich is widely reported in the official Augustean literature.\n",

After a short discussion of these notions in the context of a\nsimple toy model, they are defined in general terms. Afterwards, we discuss how\nthese definitions can help to understand how gauge symmetries can be at the\nsame time fundamentally important and purely mathematical redundancies. In this\ncontext, we also argue that local gauge symmetry is not the defining feature of\na gauge theory since every theory can be rewritten in locally invariant terms.\nWe then discuss what really makes a gauge theory different and why the\nwidespread \"gauge argument\" is, at most, a useful didactic tool.

One upshot is that standard pictures of\nwhat a scientific theory can be are grossly inadequate. In particular, standard\nformulations assume, with no argument ever given, that it is possible to make a\nclean separation between, on the one hand, one part of the scientific knowledge\na physical theory embodies, viz., that encoded in the pure mathematical\nformalism and, on the other, the remainder of that knowledge. The remainder\nincludes at a minimum what is encoded in the practice of modeling particular\nsystems, of performing experiments, of bringing the results of theory and\nexperiment into mutually fruitful contact---in sum, real application of the\ntheory in actual scientific practice. This assumption comes out most clearly in\nthe picture of semantics that naturally accompanies the standard view of\ntheories: semantics is fixed by ontology's shining City on the Hill, and all\nepistemology and methodology and other practical issues and considerations are\nsegregated to the ghetto of the theory's pragmatics. We should not assume such\na clean separation is possible without an argument, and, indeed, I offer many\narguments that such a separation is not feasible. An adequate semantics for\ntheories cannot be founded on ontology, but rather on epistemology and\nmethodology.\n",

After completion of his observatory in 1841 Gerling's\nstudents started observing and theoretically analysing the orbits of the\ncontinuously newly discovered asteroids including the perturbation of the\nlarger solar system bodies.

        "summary": "  Before the establishment of the hot Big Bang scenario as the modern paradigm\nof cosmology, it faced several early competitors : the so-called stationary\ncosmological models. There were truly plural and independent approaches\nincorporating cosmic expansion but without time evolution of the total\ncosmological density, thanks to the inclusion of some processes of continuous\nmatter creation. We distinguish here three different independent motivations\nleading to a stationary vision of the universe. First, Einstein's concerns on\nthe asymptotic behaviour of gravitation led him to consider continuous matter\ncreation in a recently discovered unpublished work dated of 1931. Second, there\nis the quest by Dirac and Jordan for a scientific explanation of numerical\ncoincidences in the values of fundamental constants, leading both to a time\nvariation of Newton's constant and spontaneous matter creation. The third one\nappears in the steady-state theory of Bondi and Gold as the postulate of the\nPerfect Cosmological Principle according to which the properties of the\nuniverse do not depend in any way of the location and the epoch of the\nobserver. Hoyle developed a mathematical model of spontaneous matter creation\nfrom a modification of general relativity that should be considered as a direct\nlegacy of Einstein's and Dirac's approaches. Hoyle's model allows obtaining a\n\"\\textit{wide cosmological principle}\" as an end-product, echoing Bondi and\nGold's Perfect Cosmological Principle. Somewhat ironically, many modern key\nquestions in hot Big Bang cosmology, like dark energy and inflation, can\ntherefore be directly related to the physical motivations of the early\nstationary cosmologies.\n",

I argue that this\nprinciple is neither an aesthetic nor a sociologically-influenced principle. I\ncontend that naturalness may only be plausibly argued to be an\naesthetic/sociological principle when formal measures of naturalness and their\nuse in physics communities are conflated with the central dogma of naturalness\n- the former may indeed be argued to be sociologically-influenced and somewhat\narbitrary - but these formal measures of naturalness are in fact less\nsuccessful than AoS naturalness. I put forward arguments as to why AoS\nnaturalness is well-defined and why it was reasonable for physicists to endorse\nthis naturalness principle on both theoretical and empirical grounds.\n  Up to date, no compelling reasons have appeared as to why the laws of nature\nshould generically decoupling into quasi-autonomous physical domains. A\ndecoupling of scales in the quantum realm is often claimed to be entailed by\nthe Decoupling Theorem (Cao and Schweber (1993)), yet I will show that this\ntheorem is too weak to underwrite quasi-autonomous physical domains in quantum\nfield theories because one should additionally impose that parameters be\nnatural.

As such it aims to show how one\nmay engage in the natural sciences and in metaphysics under the restriction\nthat certain conditions are imposed on our cognition of objects. Underlying\nKant's doctrine, however, is an ontological posit, of a sort, regarding the\nfundamental nature of our cognition. This posit, sometimes called the\n`discursivity thesis', while considered to be completely obvious and\nuncontroversial by some, has nevertheless been denied by thinkers both before\nand after Kant. One such thinker is Jakob Friedrich Fries, an early neo-Kantian\nwho, despite his rejection of discursivity, also advocated for a\nmetaphilosophical understanding of critical philosophy. As I will explain, a\nconsequence for Fries of the denial of discursivity is a radical\nreconceptualisation of the method of critical philosophy; whereas this method\nis a priori for Kant, for Fries it is in general empirical. I discuss these\nissues in the context of quantum theory, and I focus in particular on the views\nof the physicist Niels Bohr and the Neo-Friesian philosopher Grete Hermann. I\nargue that Bohr's understanding of quantum mechanics can be seen as a natural\nextension of an orthodox Kantian viewpoint in the face of the challenges posed\nby quantum theory, and I compare this with the extension of Friesian philosophy\nthat is represented by Hermann's view.\n",

Kepler's starry universe was in fact the Copernican universe\nsupported by observations of the stars, which showed them to have measureable\napparent sizes. Not until the later seventeenth century were those apparent\nsizes shown to be spurious, allowing for a universe in which the stars were\nsuns.\n",

        "summary": "  This history of the concept of fact reveals that the fact-oriented practices\nof German physicists and historians derived from common origins. The concept of\nfact became part of the German language remarkably late. It gained momentum\nonly toward the end of the eighteenth century. I show that the concept of fact\nemerged as part of a historical knowledge tradition, which comprised both human\nand natural empirical study. Around 1800, parts of this tradition, including\nthe concept of fact, were integrated into the epistemological basis of several\nemerging disciplines, including physics and historiography. During this process\nof discipline formation, the concept of fact remained fluid. I reveal this\nfluidity by unearthing different interpretations and roles of facts in\ndifferent German contexts around 1800. I demonstrate how a fact-based\nepistemology emerged at the University of G\\\"ottingen in the late eighteenth\ncentury, by focusing on universal historian August Ludwig Schl\\\"ozer and the\nexperimentalist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. In a time of scientific and\npolitical revolutions, they regarded facts as eternal knowledge, contrasting\nthem with short-lived theories and speculations. Remarkably, Schl\\\"ozer and\nLichtenberg construed facts as the basis of Wissenschaft, but not as\nWissenschaft itself. Only after 1800, empirically minded German physicists and\nhistorians granted facts self-contained value. As physics and historiography\nbecame institutionalized at German universities, the concept of fact acquired\ndifferent interpretations in different disciplinary settings. These related to\nfact-oriented research practices, such as precision measurement in physics and\nsource criticism in historiography.\n",

After reviewing the definition of active\ndiffeomorphisms, this paper uses them to outline a mathematical proof of\nEinstein's result. The relativistic field equation is shown to have multiple\nsolutions, just as Einstein thought. But these multiple solutions can be\ndistinguished by the different physical meaning that each metric solution\nattaches to the local coordinates used to write it. Thus the hole argument,\nwhile formally correct, does not prohibit the subsequent rejection of spurious\nsolutions and the selection of a physically unique metric. This conclusion is\nillustrated using the Schwarzschild metric. It is suggested that the Einstein\nhole argument therefore cannot be used to argue against substantivalism.\n",

That said, Wiener, as he\npointed out, was inspired by the work of some French mathematicians,\nparticularly Gateaux and Levy. Moreover, although Richard Feynman has\nindependently found this notion, we show that in the course of the 1930s, while\nsearching a kind of geometrization of quantum mechanics, another French\nmathematician, Adolphe Buhl, noticed by the philosopher Gaston Bachelard, had\nhimself been close to forge such a notion. This reminder does not detract from\nthe remarkable discovery of Feynman, which must undeniably be attributed to\nhim. We also show, however, that the difficulties of this notion had to wait\nmany years before being resolved, and it was only recently that the path\nintegral could be rigorously established from a mathematical point of view.\n",

Of Bononia, we know the\ndate of foundation as Roman colony in 189 BC, given by Livy. We will show that,\naccording to Roman chronology and Republican calendar, it is impossible that\nBononia had been oriented to the sunrise on the day given by Livy. The\ndiscrepancy is huge. Moreover, the direction of the decumanus cannot match the\ndates of Terminalia for 189 BC. However, if we consider that the layout that we\nsee today is that of a recolonization under Octavian, we can have a certain\nagreement between the direction of the decumanus and the sunrise on the day of\nTerminalia (within three days), and a perfect agreement with the day of the\nfestival of Armilustrium. In the proposed discussion, we will stress in\nparticular the problem of the discrepancy between the historical dates of Roman\nchronology and the Julian dates, those that we can find according to an\nastronomical analysis.

The quantum ontology\nthus derived appears to be strictly limited to evolving experimental contexts\nand instantaneous measurement outcomes, which are to be understood,\nrespectively, as mere potential measurement outcomes and actual ones. The\nnotions of material body in particular and physical system in general are\nabsent from this ontology, hence the vanishing of Schroedinger's cat and EPR\nparadoxes, as well as of the quantum measurement problem.

        "summary": "  The problematic relationship between science and philosophy has, since the\nbeginning of modernity, divided the world into two separate domains: nature and\nhuman. Some of today's schools of philosophy and epistemological inquiry have\nmaintained a radical separation to the point where they refuse to maintain any\ncommonality within the two. We argue that such a dichotomy will not only\ndestroy the idea of the unity of knowledge from a theoretical perspective but,\nit will destroy a unified understanding of reality. This article is a critique\nof now mainstream belief of such dichotomy through re-reading of Leibniz's idea\non the unity of knowledge. The distinctive feature of Leibniz's approach, which\nwas specifically laid down in his correspondence with Clarke, is that his way\nof reasoning is philosophical as well as physical. In Leibniz's view what\nguarantees the soundness of philosophical principles cannot defy the laws of\nphysics. We shall also demonstrate that Chaos Theory is consistent with the\naffinities of Leibniz's approach. The main focus of this article is on\nre-evaluating views on causal determinism and randomness as well as free will.\nThe final claim of this article is that the natural world and human world\nfollow the same causal deterministic laws, and that causal laws are however\nnonlinear. Knowledge of our reality should be rigorously sought in both the\ndomains of humanities and natural sciences, but this causal determinism should\ndistance itself from a simple linear causal model. What is thought of as random\nevents or probabilistic events in the physical world, as well as in the human\nworld, are not ontologically run by chance. The complexity and vastness of\nreality are such that our knowledge of reality always suffers a lack, and it is\nthis lack of knowledge that is usually being called randomness.\n",

This is exemplified by the thought experiment known as\nGalileo's ship: the inertial state of motion of a ship is immaterial to how\nevents unfold in the cabin, but is registered in the values of relational\nquantities such as the distance and velocity of the ship relative to the shore.\n  But the significance of gauge symmetries seems less clear. For example, can\ngauge transformations in Yang-Mills theory---taken as mere descriptive\nredundancy---exhibit a similar relational empirical significance as the boosts\nof Galileo's ship? This question has been debated in the last fifteen years in\nphilosophy of physics.\n  I will argue that the answer is `yes', but only for a finite subset of gauge\ntransformations, and under special conditions. Under those conditions, we can\nmathematically identify empirical significance with a failure of supervenience:\nthe state of the Universe is not uniquely determined by the intrinsic state of\nits isolated subsystems. Empirical significance is therefore encoded in those\nrelations between subsystems that stand apart from their intrinsic states.\n",

This is the foundation of the Eurocentric four-season Julian (and later\nGregorian) calendar. Famous examples include Stonehenge, Newgrange, Chichen\nItza, and Chankillo.

The second example deals with the\nconflict between the assumed reality of quantum fields, so fundamental and\nessential to our standard physics worldview, and the dynamics of the observable\nuniverse. The third deals with an all-important difference between conventional\nmodern physics constructed in the unreal and unobservable empty `space' and an\nempirically and logically determined physics with matter-filled universe as its\narena. The acknowledgment of the observable matter-filled universe necessitates\nreformulation of dynamics with total relativity.

So in order to discuss\n3-space and dynamics, we recall briefly Minkowski's approach in 1910\nimplementing the nowadays commonly used 4-vector calculus and related tensorial\nrepresentations as well as Klein's 1910 paper on the geometry of the Lorentz\ngroup. To include microscopic representations, we discuss few aspects of\nWigner's and Weinberg's 'boost' approach to describe 'any spin' with respect to\nits reductive Lie algebra and coset theory, and we relate the physical\nidentification to objects in $P^{5}$ based on the case $(1,0)\\oplus(0,1)$ of\nthe electromagnetic field. So instead of following this -- in some aspects --\nspecial and misleading 'old' representation theory, based on 4-vector calculus\nand tensors, we provide and use an alternative representation based on line\ngeometry which -- besides comprising known representation theory -- is capable\nof both describing (classical) projective geometry of 3-space as well as it\nyields spin matrices and the classical Lie transfer. In addition, this geometry\nis capable of providing a more general route to known Lie symmetries,\nespecially of the su(2)$\\oplus$i~su(2) Lie algebra of special relativity, as\nwell as it comprises gauge theories and affine geometry. Thus it serves as\nfoundation for a future understanding of more general representation theory of\nrelativity based, however, on roots known from classical projective geometry\nand $P^{5}$. As an application, we discuss Lorentz transformations in point\nspace in terms of line and Complex geometry, where we can identify them as...\n",

After ascertaining that his categories\nmost naturally have the structure of ontological equivalence classes, we show\nthat they cannot be seriously introduced into the quantum formalism without\nrendering it incoherent, as under some circumstances the formalism permits an\nequality between members of distinct equivalence classes. This is labeled the\n`equality of inequivalents problem'. Three possible reactions are discussed:\nFirst, one could deny the problem by challenging some of the assumptions that\nunderlie its formulation; second, one could accept the problem and take it to\nbe grounds for dismissing Heisenberg's or similar distinctions altogether;\nthird, one could accept the problem but take its source to be not Heisenberg's\ndistinction but the quantum formalism. A plausibility argument in support of\nthe third reaction is given by analogy: it is shown that axiomatic probability\nsuffers from a similar problem if one wishes to seriously distinguish between\nthings which are possibilities and things which are not. An enriched\naxiomatization of probability is proposed which captures the concept of\nprobability as a measure over possibilities and thereby overcomes the equality\nof inequivalents problem in axiomatic probability.\n",

By assuming the supervenience of a conscious state on some\nsufficient underlying physical state, I show that the existence of two or more\ninstances, whether spacelike or timelike, of the same conscious state leads to\na logical contradiction, ultimately refuting the assumption that a conscious\nstate can be physically reset to an earlier state or duplicated by any physical\nmeans.

        "summary": "  Many macroscopic physical processes are known to occur in a time-directed way\ndespite the apparent time-symmetry of the known fundamental laws. A popular\nexplanation is to postulate an unimaginably atypical state for the early\nuniverse -- a \"Past Hypothesis\" (PH) -- that seeds the time-asymmetry from\nwhich all others follow. I will argue that such a PH faces serious new\ndifficulties. First I strengthen the grounds for existing criticism by\nproviding a systematic analytic framework for assessing the status of the PH. I\noutline three broad categories of criticism that put into question a list of\nessential requirements of the proposal. The resulting analysis paints a grim\npicture for the prospects of providing an adequate formulation for an explicit\nPH. I then provide a new argument that substantively extends this criticism by\nshowing that any time-independent measure on the space of models of the\nuniverse must necessarily break one of its gauge symmetries. The PH then faces\na new dilemma: reject a gauge symmetry of the universe and introduce a\ndistinction without difference or reject the time-independence of the measure\nand lose explanatory power.\n",

        "summary": "  The notion of tree network has sparked renewed interest in recent years,\nparticularly in computer science and biology (neural network). However, this\nnotion is usually interpreted in an extremely restrictive way: essentially\nlinked to data processing, today tree networks are hybrid network topologies in\nwhich star networks are generally interconnected via bus networks. These\nnetworks are, most often, hierarchical and regular, and each of their nodes can\nhave an arbitrary number of child nodes. At the outset, however, the notion of\ntree network, introduced in 1936 by Belgian physicist Julien Pacotte, was quite\ndifferent: more general and, at the same time, more constrained, it should also\nserve an ambitious objective: the reconstruction of mathematics from concrete\nempirical structures. Usually poorly commented on and poorly understood\n(especially by philosophers), it had no real posterity. In this article, we\nfirst try to clarify this notion of \"tree network\" in the sense of Julien\nPacotte, which makes it possible to eliminate the bad interpretations to which\nthis notion has given rise. To this end, we use the language and concepts of\ngraph theory and formalize the main properties of these networks which,\ncontrary to popular belief, are not, in general, trees. In a second part, we\nthen try to follow and explain, step by step, how Pacotte intended, using\nconcepts borrowed from projective geometry, to reconstruct all of mathematics\nfrom such a network.\n",

Moreover, they claimed that Einstein - who was a supporter of the\nstatistical interpretation of quantum mechanics - endorsed an epistemic view of\n$\\psi$. In this essay we critically assess such a classification and some of\nits consequences by proposing a two-fold argumentation. Firstly, we show that\nHarrigan and Spekkens' categorization implicitly assumes that a complete\ndescription of a quantum system (its ontic state, $\\lambda$) only concerns\nsingle, individual systems instantiating absolute, intrinsic properties.\nSecondly, we argue that such assumptions conflict with some current\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics, which employ different ontic states as a\ncomplete description of quantum systems. In particular, we will show that,\nsince in the statistical interpretation ontic states describe ensembles rather\nthan individuals, such a view cannot be considered psi-epistemic. As a\nconsequence, the authors misinterpreted Einstein's view concerning the nature\nof the quantum state. Next, we will focus on Relationalist Quantum Mechanics\nand Perspectival Quantum Mechanics, which in virtue of their relational and\nperspectival metaphysics employ ontic states lambda dealing with relational\nproperties. We conclude that Harrigan and Spekkens' categorization is too\nnarrow and entails an inadequate classification of the mentioned\ninterpretations of quantum theory. Hence, any satisfactory classification of\nquantum ontological models ought to take into account the variations of\n$\\lambda$ across different interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n",

To defend the\nthesis that the whole of physical reality was caused to exist a finite time\nago, William Lane Craig and co-author James Sinclair have argued the low\nentropy interface between universes should instead be understood as the\nbeginning of two universes. Here, I present Craig and Sinclair with a dilemma.\nOn the one hand, if the direction of time is reducible, as friends of the\nMentaculus -- e.g., David Albert, Barry Loewer, and David Papineau -- maintain,\nthen there is reason to think that the direction of time and the entropic arrow\nof time align. But on that account, efficient causation is likely reducible to\nnon-causal phenomena. In consequence, contrary to Craig and Sinclair's\ntheological aims, things can begin to exist without causes. On the other hand,\nif the direction of time is not reducible, Craig and Sinclair's interpretation\nof bounce cosmologies is unjustified. Lastly, a reply to a potential objection\nmotivates a discussion of how to interpret bounce cosmologies on the tensed\ntheory of absolute time favored by Craig and Sinclair. I offer two\ninterpretations of bounce cosmologies that, given a tensed theory of absolute\ntime, are preferable to those Craig and Sinclair offer, yet inconsistent with\ntheir project in natural theology; on one interpretation, the universe does not\nrequire a supernatural cause and, on the other, bounce cosmologies represent\nthe universe as never having begun to exist.\n",

This paper gives our general framework\nfor discussing functionalism. Following Lewis, we take it as a species of\nreduction. We start by expounding reduction in a broadly Nagelian sense. Then\nwe argue that Lewis's functionalism is an improvement on Nagelian reduction.\nThis paper thereby sets the scene for the other papers, which will apply our\nframework to theories of space and time.\n  Overall, we come to praise spacetime functionalism, not to bury it. But we\ncriticize the recent philosophical literature for failing to stress:\n  (i) functionalism's being a species of reduction (in particular: reduction of\nchrono-geometry to the physics of matter and radiation);\n  (ii) functionalism's idea of specifying several concepts simultaneously by\ntheir roles;\n  (iii) functionalism's providing bridge laws that are mandatory, not optional:\nthey are statements of identity (or co-extension) that are conclusions of a\ndeductive argument; and once we infer them, we have a reduction in a Nagelian\nsense.\n  On the other hand, some of the older philosophical literature, and the\nmathematical physics literature, is faithful to these ideas (i) to (iii). In\nvarious papers, falling under various research programmes, the unique\ndefinability of a chrono-geometric concept (or concepts) in terms of matter and\nradiation, and a corresponding bridge law and reduction, is secured by a\nprecise theorem.

We consider claims that the paper\nwas neither original nor important; we find that, by providing the first\nspecific analysis of the case of a dynamic cosmology without a cosmological\nconstant or spatial curvature, the authors delivered a unique, simple model\nwith a straightforward relation between cosmic expansion and the mean density\nof matter that set an important benchmark for both theorists and observers.

Because of such effects, rotation has played a central role in\nthe absolute-relational debate and poses a particularly difficult challenge to\nthe relationalist. In this paper, we provide a qualified response to this\nchallenge that significantly weakens the absolutist position. We present a\ntheory that, contrary to orthodoxy, can account for all rotational effects\nwithout introducing, as the absolutist does, a fixed standard of rotation.\nInstead, our theory posits a universal SO(3) charge that plays the role of\nangular momentum and couples to inter-particle relations via terms commonly\nseen in standard gauge theories such as electromagnetism and the Standard Model\nof particle physics. Our theory makes use of an enriched form of relationalism:\nit adds an SO(3) structure to the traditional relational description. Our\nconstruction is made possible by the modern tools of gauge theory, which reveal\na simple relational law describing rotational effects. In this way, we can save\nthe phenomena of Newtonian mechanics using conserved charges and relationalism.\nIn a second paper, we will further explore the ontological and explanatory\nimplications of the theory developed here.\n",

Secondly, I show how focusing on the extended process of inquiry\n(rather than the mere presence or absence of states like knowledge) provides a\nbetter evaluation of different types of progress.

Abandoning\nthe Aristotelian tradition centered on the notion of substance, I claim that\nRQM embraces an ontology of properties that finds its roots in the heritage of\nDavid Hume. To this regard, defining what kind of concrete physical objects\npopulate the world according to RQM, I argue that this theoretical framework\ncan be made compatible with (i) a property-oriented ontology, in which the\nnotion of object can be easily defined, and (ii) moderate structural realism, a\nphilosophical position where relations and relata are both fundamental.\nFinally, I conclude that under this reading relational quantum mechanics should\nbe included among the full-fledged realist interpretations of quantum theory.\n",

Predicated on the concept of trading zones and actor network models,\nthe paper addresses the problem of extinction of simulation codes and attempts\nto understand their evolution and development within those frameworks. We show\nthat simulation codes of closed type develop to the level of creoles, becoming\nlocal languages and standards of scientific centers and disappearing as their\nfew main developers leave, whereas codes of open types become universal\nlanguages, imposing problem-solving patterns on the entire community and\ncrowding out other codes. The paper suggests that because of simulations'\nreliance on tacit knowledge, practices entrenched in codes cannot be\nexhaustively explicated or transmitted through writing alone; on the contrary,\nthe life cycle of a simulation code is determined by the life cycle of its\ntrading zone. We examine the extent to which both of these phenomena pose a\nrisk to the preservation of knowledge. Bearing upon intergenerational ethics,\nwe draw analogies between the pure intergenerational problem (PIP) and the\nproblem of preserving the knowledge implemented in simulation codes and\ntransmitting it to future generations. We argue that for the complete transfer\nof knowledge, it is necessary to develop and maintain inhabitability and\nsustainability of simulation trading zones in a controllable way, at least\nuntil the demand for these codes is warranted to cease in the future.\n",

It assumed the existence of a static aether\nfilling space in which particles are affected by the Lorentz factor for length\ncontraction to explain the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment.\nHowever, it was early abandoned in favour of SR due to the apparent arbitrary\nintroduction of the Lorentz factor. The aether has thereafter been assumed not\nto exist as it is seemingly undetectable and not needed for the SR. In this\ndiscussion paper it is argued that this reasoning to reject the aether is\nunfounded since the Lorentz factor also appears as an increased resistance term\nin fluid dynamics when the speed of sound is approached. This means that, for\nexample, particle accelerator tests of the Lorentz factor can be interpreted as\na form of detection of a fluidic aether. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nmass-energy equivalence is identical to the energy for compression of a fluid\nwith the speed of sound equal to the speed of light.

Johannes Kepler emphasized this, especially in arguing against Giordano\nBruno. Jesuit astronomers like Tacquet and Scheiner understood this.

In his published paper of November 18, 1915, Einstein presented a\nsolution to the problem of the perihelion motion of Mercury and obtained the\ncorrect result of 43 seconds of arc per century. Before 1915, Einstein had\nestablished non-covariant field equations (the Entwurf field equations). But in\n1915, he changed his mind and dropped these equations and was led to general\ncovariance. In a manuscript written in 1913, Einstein and his best friend\nMichele Besso tried to solve the Entwurf field equations to attain the\nperihelion advance of Mercury. The end result arrived at by Einstein was 1821\nseconds of arc per century. To make a long story short, the field of a static\nSun produced an advance of the perihelion of Mercury of 18 seconds of arc per\ncentury. Einstein kept quiet about this result and continued to work on the\nEntwurf theory. Janssen and Renn ask: If we follow the prescriptions of Karl\nPopper, why did Einstein not accept that his Entwurf theory had been falsified?\nThey further ask: Given the undeniable importance of Besso's earlier\ncalculations, why did Einstein not invite Besso as a co-author of his November\n1915 paper on the perihelion motion of Mercury? Besso did not even get an\nacknowledgment in Einstein's paper. After a brief review of Einstein's and\nBesso's early attempts at calculating the advance of the perihelion of Mercury,\nI discuss falsification and confirmation by previously known evidence and then\npropose an answer to the above two questions.\n",

That's certainly a vague concept, but at the same time it's\nboth simple and satisfying from a philosophical point of view: things do not\nchange along time, but they do change and the measurement of such changes is\nwhat we call time. This deprives time of any attribute of substantiality,\nmeanwhile depriving it of all problems in defining the properties of time as a\nsubstance. With the rise of Classical Mechanics, Aristotle's view is abandoned\nand Newton's concept of \"true\" and absolute time imposes itself; time flows\nindependently on changes of any kind. Relativity will then radically modify our\nconcept of time, but won't actually modify the fundamental idea: things keep\nchanging along time -- changes do not make time. This work will argue\nAristotle's thesis, showing how such an approach automatically leads to the\nprinciples of Special Relativity. An interesting consequence and, at least\nvirtually, measurable will also be highlighted: the fact that synchronizing two\nclocks with a precision greater than a certain scale is impossible, estimating\nsuch scale around $10^{-22}$s.\n",

While a number of respectable\nphilosophers advocate some sort of panpsychistic solution to the mind-body\nproblem now, fewer advocate that idealism can contribute substantially to the\ndebate. Interest in idealism has nevertheless risen again, as can be seen also\nfrom recent overview articles and collections of works. The working hypothesis\nhere is that a properly formulated idealism can not only provide an alternative\nview of the mind/matter gap, but that this new view will also shed light on\nopen questions in our common scientific, i.e. materialist, world view. To\ninvestigate this possibility, idealism first of all needs a model for the\nintegration of modern science which allows for a mathematically consistent\nreinterpretation of the physical world as a limiting case of a both material\nand non-material world, which would make the outcome of idealistic\nconsiderations accessible to scientific investigation. To develop such a model\nI will first try to explain what I mean when I speak of a 'scientifically\ntenable' idealism, including a formulation of the emanation problem which for\nidealism replaces the interaction problem, then give a very brief summary of\nthe available elements of such a theory in the philosophical literature, before\nsketching out some 'design questions' which have to be answered upon the\nconstruction of such models, and finally put forward a first model for a\nscientifically tenable objective idealism.\n",

There are currently two, viable theories of cosmology: the standard\ncosmological model, and a theory due to Mordehai Milgrom called MOND. Both\ntheories can point to successes and failures, but only MOND has repeatedly made\nnovel predictions that were subsequently found to be correct.

        "summary": "  Wolfgang Pauli's philosophy and physics were intertwined. His philosophy was\na variety of Platonism, in which Pauli's affiliation with Carl Jung formed an\nintegral part, but Pauli's philosophical explorations in physics appeared\nbefore he met Jung. Jung validated Pauli's psycho-philosophical perspective.\nThus, the roots of Pauli's physics and philosophy are important in the history\nof modern physics. In his early physics, Pauli attempted to ground his\ntheoretical physics in positivism. He then began instead to trust his intuitive\nvisualizations of entities that formed an underlying reality to the sensible\nphysical world. These visualizations included holistic kernels of\nmathematical-physical entities that later became for him synonymous with Jung's\nmandalas. I have connected Pauli's visualization patterns in physics during the\nperiod 1900 to 1930 to the psychological philosophy of Jung and displayed some\nexamples of Pauli's creativity in the development of quantum mechanics. By\nlooking at Pauli's early physics and philosophy, we gain insight into Pauli's\ncontributions to quantum mechanics. His exclusion principle, his influence on\nWerner Heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm\nlogical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron\nspinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum\nphysicists, all point to Pauli being the dominant genius in the development of\nquantum theory. Because Pauli was in a difficult individuation process during\nhis early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often\ncontradictory. My analysis of Pauli's physics and philosophy is based upon\npublished and unpublished sources, and Pauli's later reflections. A pattern has\nemerged. Pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and\nempiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. This coupled with\ndisturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led Pauli to seek\ntreatment at the Jung Clinic. Pauli's psychological tension diminished after\n1932. His physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. His philosophy\nallied with Jung's resembled a Platonism of combined psyche and physics. Pauli\nsought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal\nwas cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58.\n",

An original\nscheme of a simple method for a fairly accurate time measurement with their\nhelp is also proposed. The model proposed by us, which describes a vertical\nsundial, is a vertical sundial with an inclined gnomon that takes into account\nthe latitude of the area. The model proposed by us is characterized by marking\nthe hour lines from 6 to 12 o'clock every hour. From 12:00 a shift is made in\nthe marking of the hour lines for half an hour, and then the marking is\nrepeated every hour. As a consequence of the reconstruction of the vertical\nsundial, we have developed and proposed a model that describes the design\nfeatures and operation of two types of L-shaped sundial. They had to work in\nconjunction with an inclined gnomon, like a vertical sundial, or directly with\na vertical sundial. In this case, the L-shaped sundial could complement the\nvertical sundial by providing the ability to read hour markers and interpret\nthe readings of the vertical sundial, as there were no inscriptions on the\nvertical sundial. The article also provides a decoding of the inscription from\nthe tomb of Seti I, which has long intrigued researchers. It is proved that the\ninscription contains the lengths of the intervals between adjacent marks of the\nL-shaped sundial of the second type, where the first interval corresponds not\nto one hour, but to half an hour.\n",

I analyze this claim and find that all methods destined to measure\n$k$ fail without further assumptions, similar to the second postulate.\nSpecifically, measuring $k$ requires a signal that travels identically in\nopposite directions (this is unrelated to the conventionality of\nsynchronization, as the one-postulate program implicitly selects the standard\nsynchronization convention).

Later, Swarup went to Stanford where he\ncompleted a PhD with Ron Bracewell working on the new Solar Microwave\nSpectroheliograph. In the era 1960-1963, with the encouragement of Pawsey,\nseveral colleagues in Australia and Bracewell, discussions began among a number\nof Indian colleagues to form a radio astronomy group in India. The main players\nwere G. Swarup, T.K. Menon, M.R. Kundu and T. Krishnan. Homi J. Bhabha, the\nDirector of TIFR, made the decisive offer to this group to start a radio\nastronomy project in early 1962. Swarup joined TIFR in early April 1963. Many\nfactors contributed to the successful formation of the new group: international\nnetworking among scientists of several generations, rapid decisions by Bhabha\nand the readiness to take chances in choosing promising, young, energetic\nscientists.In December 2013, we have celebrated 50 years of ground breaking\nresearch by the TIFR radio astronomers as well as the outstanding decade of\nresearch with the GMRT- the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope.

After each plate was developed, astronomers and\ntheir assistants studied and annotated the plates as they made astrometric,\nphotometric and spectroscopic measurements, counted galaxies, observed stellar\nvariability, tracked meteors, and calculated the ephemerides of asteroids and\ncomets. In this paper, the authors assess the importance of the plate\nannotations for future scientific, historical, and educational programs.\nUnfortunately, many of these interesting annotations are now being erased when\ngrime is removed from the plates before they are digitized to make the\nphotometric data available for time-domain astrophysics. To see what\nprofessional astronomers and historians think about this situation, the authors\nconducted a survey. This paper captures the lively discussion on the pros and\ncons of the removal of plate markings, how to best to document them if they\nmust be cleaned off, and what to do with plates whose annotations are deemed\ntoo valuable to be erased. Three appendices to the paper offer professional\nguidance on the best practices for handling and cleaning the plates,\nphotographing any annotations, and rehousing them.\n",

Later, Einstein published a paper on\ngravitational waves. The solution presented in this paper did not satisfy the\nabove restrictive condition. In his gravitational waves paper, Einstein\nconcluded that gravitational fields propagate at the speed of light. The\nsolution is the Minkowski flat metric plus a small disturbance propagating in a\nflat spacetime. Einstein calculated the small deviation from Minkowski metric\nin a manner analogous to that of retarded potentials in electrodynamics.\nHowever, in obtaining the above derivation, Einstein made a mathematical error.\nThis error caused him to obtain three different types of waves compatible with\nhis approximate field equations: longitudinal waves, transverse waves and a new\ntype of wave. Einstein added an Addendum in which he suggested that in systems\nin unimodular coordinates only waves of the third type occur and these waves\ntransport energy. He became obsessed with his unimodular coordinates.\nEinstein's colleagues demonstrated to him that in the coordinate system in\nunimodular coordinates the gravitational wave of a mass point carry no energy,\nbut Einstein tried to persuade them that he had actually not made a mistake in\nhis gravitational waves paper. Einstein, however, eventually accepted his\ncolleagues results and dropped the restrictive unimodular coordinates. This\nfinally led him to discover plane transverse gravitational waves.\n",

We then comment on Rosenfeld's General Theory\ndealing with symmetries and constraints, symmetry generators, conservation laws\nand the construction of a Hamiltonian in the case of phase-space constraints.\nIt is remarkable that he was able to derive expressions for all phase space\nsymmetry generators without making explicit reference to the generator of time\nevolution. In his Applications, Rosenfeld treated the general relativistic\nexample of Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac theory. We show, that although Rosenfeld\nrefrained from fully applying his general findings to this example, he could\nhave obtained the Hamiltonian. Many of Rosenfeld's discoveries were\nre-developed or re-discovered by others two decades later, yet as we show there\nremain additional firsts that are still not recognized in the community.\n",

Considerable efforts have been devoted\nto derive fundamental cosmological parameters from the characteristics of this\nradiation that led to a surprising universe that is shaped by at least three\nmajor unknown components: inflation, dark matter and dark energy. This is an\nimportant weakness of the present consensus cosmological model that justifies\nraising several questions on the CMB interpretation. Can we consider its\ncosmological nature as undisputable? Do other possible interpretations exist in\nthe context of other cosmological theories or simply as a result of other\nphysical mechanisms that could account for it? In an effort to questioning the\nvalidity of scientific hypotheses and the under-determination of theories\ncompared to observations, we examine here the difficulties that still exist on\nthe interpretation of this diffuse radiation and explore other proposed tracks\nto explain its origin. We discuss previous historical concepts of diffuse\nradiation before and after the CMB discovery and underline the limit of our\npresent understanding.\n",

I highlight the mathematically suggestive nature of\nthe formula, accessible even to a high school student, that could have provided\na clue to the physical reasoning of Planck. In 1905, Einstein made the bold\nphoton hypothesis and was able to predict the formula for the photoelectric\neffect which was not fully explored then.

Furthermore,\nSchroedinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of\nthe explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility\nof superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed,\nSchroedinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of\ndiscrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different\nenergies.\n  However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schroedinger's wave\nmechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full\nimplementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix\nformalism reconciles quantum jumps with continuous time evolution through the\nidentification of quantum jumps with transitions between different sectors of\nFock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a\nsum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock\nspace.\n  In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering\nmatrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from the\nresolution of the dichotomy between quantum jumps and continuous time evolution\ntherefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of\nquantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate\nthat discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take\ninto account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the\nrole of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of\nquantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually\nexpected.\n",

Going back\nand rethinking the consequences of the experiment in a new context, theoretical\nor empirical, has great merit as a strategy for investigation and for\nscientific problem analysis. I apply this analysis to the interplay between\nFizeau's classic optical experiments and the building of special relativity.\nEinstein's understanding of the problems facing classical electrodynamics and\noptics, in part, was informed by Fizeau's 1851 experiments. However, between\n1851 and 1905, Fizeau's experiments were duplicated and reinterpreted by a\nsuccession of scientists, including Hertz, Lorentz, and Michelson. Einstein's\nanalysis of the consequences of the experiments is tied closely to this\ntheoretical and experimental tradition.

        "summary": "  We present a translation of the German text of an 1874 article by Valentin\nRose that concerns the possible school of translators that worked in Toledo,\nSpain, from about 1150 to 1250. Rose's article relies significantly on the\nfirst-hand account of the activities in Toledo by the Englishman Daniel of\nMorley. The most prolific translator in Toledo was Gerard of Cremona, who\ntranslated Ptolemy's Almagest from Arabic into Latin with the help of Galib the\nMozarab; this translation was significant to Copernicus's work. Georg Peurbach\nand Regiomontanus based their Epitome of the Almagest (1463) on Gerard's\ntranslation, which in turn introduced Greek astronomy to astronomers in Italy\nand throughout Europe. Copernicus studied in Padua in the first few years of\nthe sixteenth century, where he learned about Ptolemy's Almagest. Copernicus's\nbook De Revolutionibus (1543) also contains two geometrical tools of\nastronomers from thirteenth century Maragha, and his model of the motion of the\nMoon is mathematically identical to that of Ibn al-Shatir (fourteenth century\nDamascus). A Greek language manuscript written prior to 1308, and the residence\nin Padua of Moses Galeano, a Jewish scholar from Constantinople and Crete, who\nwas familiar with the work of Ibn al-Shatir, provide evidence of the\ntransmission of Arabic astronomical ideas to Copernicus. We have only begun to\nunderstand this conduit of transmission.\n",

Looking north from the 3-d present we see\nto the north-past and so see the 4-d past. The past only contains images of the\nmaterial objects in the present, so the world we see contains no material\nobjects. We do not see a tree; we see an image of the tree, or, with two\nmirrors, an infinite stream of images of the tree receding into the 4-d past.\nThe science of the 4-d past described with data-defined language is objective.\nWhen the Relativistic Doppler Effect is so described, it is simple and\ncomplete, unlike Einstein's space and time version in his 1905 theory of\nrelativity. Scientists still use space and time science though so Berkeley's\ndiscoveries have been neglected and lost. Their recovery in this paper\nreinststes the choice between a data-defined language description of the\nobserved 4-d past and an idea-based language description of idea-based (3+1)-d\nspace and time.\n",

This appears strange: that coordinates\nare conventional markers of events seems an obvious fact, already familiar from\npre-relativistic physics. In this paper we explore the background of Einsteins\ndifficulties, going from his 1905 paper on special relativity, through his 1907\nand 1911 papers on the consequences of the equivalence principle, to the 1916\nreview paper on the general theory. As we shall argue, Einstein's problems were\nintimately connected to his early methodology, in which clarity achieved by\nconcrete physical pictures played an essential role; and to the related fact\nthat on his route to the general theory he focused on special situations that\nwere easily accessible to physical intuition. The details of this background of\nEinstein's early reasoning have not always been sufficiently appreciated in\nmodern commentaries. As we shall see, this has led to erroneous judgments about\nthe status and validity of some of the early relativistic derivations by\nEinstein and others, in particular concerning the gravitational redshift.\n",

This state of affairs lasted,\nso the story continues, until Bell in 1966 exposed von Neumann's proof as\nobviously wrong. The realization that von Neumann's proof was fallacious then\nrehabilitated hidden variables and made serious foundational research possible\nagain. It is often added in recent accounts that von Neumann's error had been\nspotted almost immediately by Grete Hermann, but that her discovery was of no\neffect due to the dominant Copenhagen Zeitgeist. We shall attempt to tell a\nstory that is more historically accurate and less ideologically charged. Most\nimportantly, von Neumann never claimed to have shown the impossibility of\nhidden variables tout court, but argued that hidden-variable theories must\npossess a structure that deviates fundamentally from that of quantum mechanics.\nBoth Hermann and Bell appear to have missed this point, moreover, both raised\nunjustified technical objections to the proof. Von Neumann's argument was\nbasically that hidden-variables schemes must violate the \"quantum principle\"\nthat physical quantities are to be represented by operators in a Hilbert space.\nAs a consequence, hidden-variables schemes, though possible in principle,\nnecessarily exhibit a certain kind of contextuality.\n",

Perhaps\nsurprisingly, once the theory is framed in this way, one can predict existence\nof a \"universal velocity\" which stays the same in all \"inertial reference\nframes\".

Thus, had these physical experiments\nbeen performed prior to Michelson-Morley type experiments (which, in principle,\ncould have been done in any period with precise enough time keeping\ninstruments), the Michelson-Morley experiments would simply give us an example\nof a physical entity, i.e., light, which enjoys this special \"universal\"\nstatus.\n",

This procedure works in the same manner for both classical and\nquantum physics. (3) There is no cogent reason to take the parameters that\nenter into the (deterministic) dynamical equations of physics to refer to\nproperties of the physical systems. Granting an ontological status to\nparameters such as mass, charge, wave functions and the like does not lead to a\ngain in explanation, but only to artificial problems. Against this background,\nI argue that there is no conflict between determinism in physics and free will\n(on whatever conception of free will), and, in general, point out the limits of\nscience when it comes to the central metaphysical issues.\n",

The crisis stemmed from the\nadmission by the IAU, amidst strong protest from PRC and some other member\ncountries, of the Republic of China (ROC) to the Union, creating the so-called\n`\\textit{Two Chinas}' -- or `\\textit{One China, one Taiwan}' problem. The\ncrisis directly led to the absence of mainland Chinese astronomers from the\nstage of international collaborations and exchanges, and was only solved two\ndecades later. The solution, accepted by all the parties involved, is that\nChina is to have two adhering organizations, with mainland China astronomers\nrepresented by the Chinese Astronomical Society located in Nanjing (China\nNanjing) and China Taiwan astronomers represented by the Academia Sinica\nlocated in Taipei (China Taipei). The denominations `\\textit{China Nanjing}'\nand `\\textit{China Taipei}' represent the IAU official resolution and should be\nused in all IAU events.\n  The China crisis, probably the most serious one in IAU history, was a painful\nlesson in the 100-year development of the Union. Yet, with its eventual\nsolution, the Union has emerged stronger, upholding its spirit of promoting\nastronomical development through international collaboration of astronomers\nfrom all regions and countries, regardless of the political systems, religion,\nethnicity, gender or level of astronomical development.\n",

For our empirical investigation, we\nconducted 50 semi-structured interviews with researchers in the rival camps of\nString Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity, coded a subset for reoccurring themes,\nand subjected the resulting data to statistical analysis. Theoretically, we\nmobilize aspects of Daston and Galison's depiction of the scientific self and\nits relation to epistemic virtues, Pierre Bourdieu's field-centered account of\nsocial space, and Kantian notions of aesthetics in order to delineate the\nsubjective tastes and the related process of collective consensus-making in\ncontemporary quantum gravity research. We make two key contributions. First,\nour analysis sheds light on the inner workings of the field by connecting its\ninternal epistemic struggles with relevant social-scientific theories. For\nexample, we are able to suggest an explanation for how one approach, String\nTheory, has become so dominant. Second, our application of theories of social\nreproduction to the substance of scientific inquiry merits some substantive\ngeneralizations to Daston and Galison's framework.

Thus, one may have any OWVL provided it is greater or equal to c/2 and\nthe round-trip velocity is c, and, since clocks can be synchronized only by\nlight signals, clock synchronization depends on whatever OWVL happens to be. I\nshow that the Dragowski and Wlodarczyk proposal to use transverse Doppler\nshifts to measure one-way velocities cannot succeed. In fact, OWVL is\nmeasurable in a synchronization-free manner by determining the minimum\nwavelength transmitted by an airgap optical barrier. OWVL along three\nnon-coplanar axes is required to determine that OWVL is c. Also, contrary to\nthe Thyssen claim that distant simultaneity is conventional, I show that, using\na moving clock, relativistic time-dilation allows the synchronization of\nisochronized stationary clocks without knowing OWVL and also allows,\nseparately, the measurement of OWVL. A burst of unstable particles is a\nsuitable moving clock. Thus, one-way velocity and synchronization are shown to\nbe independent concepts. The wavelength transmitted by an airgap and the decay\nof unstable particles have been neglected regarding OWVL, but all experiments\nin these areas have found the one-way velocity of light is c.\n",

We\npropose a solution to the mystery - in the present model the aether is always\nconserved. Interestingly it turns out that the charge velocity coincides with\nthe aether velocity. In other words, the charges appear to be part of the\naether itself. We interpret the electric field as the flux of the aether and\nthe magnetic field as the torque per unit volume.

This principle asserts that the complete state of the world\nsupervenes on the intrinsic properties of its most fundamental components and\ntheir spatiotemporal relations (the so-called Humean mosaic). There are\nwell-known arguments in the literature purporting to show that in quantum\nmechanics the Humean supervenience principle is violated, due to the existence\nof entangled states. Recently, however, arguments have been presented to the\neffect that the supervenience principle can be defended in Bohmian mechanics.\nThe key element of this strategy lies in the observation that according to\nBohmian mechanics the fundamental facts about particles are facts about their\nspatial locations, and moreover, for any proper subsystem of the world its\nstate may non-trivially depend on the spatial configuration of the rest of the\nuniverse. Thus quantum-mechanical states of subsystems do not represent their\nintrinsic properties but rather characterize their relations with the\nenvironment. In this paper we point out the worry that this Bohmian strategy\n--known as Bohumianism-- saves the letter but not the spirit of the Humean\ndoctrine of supervenience, since it prima facie violates another seemingly\nimportant Humean principle, which we call Strong Supervenience and whose denial\nimplies the existence of necessary connections among distinct individuals. We\nargue that the best defense for Bohumians is to question the fundamental\nexistence of complex physical systems and their states by treating any\nreference to them as a convenient description of the underlying collection of\nBohmian particles. We consider several pros and cons of this strategy.\n",

Bruce's fledgling interests in science and\nengineering were greatly boosted by his association with the brightest minds of\nthe newly established Royal Society of London. From an underdog position, his\ninnovations soon outdid the achievements of the era's celebrated scholars,\nenabling him to conduct some of the first promising sea trials of viable marine\ntimekeepers. International collaboration became international rivalry as time\nwent on, with little known Scottish inventions soon becoming part of mainstream\nclock designs.\n",

However, the early-sixteenth-century papal demarcation\nline was poorly defined. Expressed in degrees with respect to a vague reference\nlocation, determination of longitude at sea became crucial in the nations'\nquest for expanding spheres of influence. In Spain, King Philip II and his son,\nPhilip III, announced generous rewards for those whose solutions to the\nlongitude problem performed well in sea trials and which were suitable for\npractical implementation. The potential reward generated significant interest\nfrom scientist-scholars and opportunists alike. The solutions proposed and the\nsubset taken to sea provided important physical insights that still resonate\ntoday. None of the numerous approaches based on compass readings (\"magnetic\ndeclination\") passed the exacting sea trials, but the brightest\nsixteenth-century minds already anticipated that lunar distances and the use of\nmarine timepieces would eventually enable more precise navigation. With most\nemphasis in the English-language literature focused on longitude solutions\ndeveloped in Britain, France and the Low Countries, the earlier yet\ngroundbreaking Spanish efforts have, undeservedly, largely been forgotten.

Lie group symmetry techniques are used to derive Taylor's famous\ntwo-fifths law that relates the position of a blast wave to the time after the\nexplosion and the total energy released. The theory of exterior differential\nsystems is combined with the method of characteristics to demonstrate that the\nsolution of the blast wave problem is directly related to the basic\nrelationships that exist between the geometry (or symmetry) and the physics of\nwave propagation through the equations of motion. The point blast wave model is\ncast in terms of two exterior differential systems and both systems are shown\nto be integrable with local solutions for the velocity, pressure, and density\nalong curves in space and time behind the blast wave.\n",

Whereas other\nlongitude awards offered by the leading European maritime nations attracted\napplicants from far and wide, often accompanied by extensive, self-published\npamphlets, the alleged Venetian prize does not seem to have been subject to\nsimilar hype. The alleged existence of seventeenth-century Venetian award is\nparticularly curious, because the city's fortune was clearly in decline, and\nlongitude determination on the open seas does not appear to have been a\npriority; the city's mariners already had access to excellent \"portolan\"\ncharts.

The role German astronomers played in the discovery has\noften been overshadowed by the controversies that erupted in England and France\nafter the discovery. However, their role was crucial, not only in bringing\nabout the discovery in the first place, but also in resolving some of the\npost-discovery controversies that erupted around priority for the prediction\nand naming of the planet. German astronomers in Central and Eastern Europe\npossessed some of the best telescopes of the day and had established themselves\nover several decades as being at the forefront of observational astronomy. They\nhad produced the star charts that in the end proved indispensable for allowing\nidentification of the planet, while a German publication, Astronomische\nNachrichten, published by H. C. Schumacher in Altona, in the vicinity of\nHamburg, then part of the Kingdom of Denmark, served as the journal of record.\nThe general neglect of the German part of the story is most strongly attested\nby the inaccuracies concerning what actually happened on discovery night, which\nwere long propagated in the English-speaking literature. Notably, for 30 years\nafter the discovery, it was not appreciated that there were two observers,\nwhile the role of the sky map used was often exaggerated. This chapter sets\nforth a more complete picture, and in particular emphasises more than previous\naccounts the critical role of d'Arrest, arguing that he should be celebrated as\na co-discoverer. In addition, evidence presented here, much of it not\npreviously available in the English-speaking literature, shows that the name\n\"Neptune\" was eventually accepted throughout the scientific community based on\nGerman precedents.\n",

William Lane Craig disagrees and argues\nthat although relativity is empirically adequate within a domain of\napplication, relativity should be supplanted by a Neo-Lorentzian alternative\nthat allows for absolute time. Meanwhile, Craig and co-author Sinclair have\nargued that physical cosmology supports the conclusion that physical reality\nbegan to exist at a finite time in the past. However, on their view, the\nbeginning of physical reality requires the objective passage of absolute time,\nso that the beginning of physical reality stands or falls with Craig's\nNeo-Lorentzian metaphysics. I raise doubts about whether, given Craig's\nNeoLorentzian metaphysics, physical cosmology could adequately support a\nbeginning of physical reality within the finite past. Craig and Sinclair's\nconception of the beginning of the universe requires a past boundary to the\nuniverse. A past boundary to the universe cannot be directly observed and so\nmust be inferred from the observed matter-energy distribution in conjunction\nwith auxilary hypotheses drawn from a substantive physical theory. Craig's\nbrand of Neo Lorentzianism has not been sufficiently well specified so as to\ninfer either that there is a past boundary or that the boundary is located in\nthe finite past. Thus, Neo Lorentzianism implicitly introduces a form of\nskepticism that removes the ability that we might have otherwise had to infer a\nbeginning of the universe. Furthermore, in analyzing traditional big bang\nmodels, I develop criteria that Neo-Lorentzians should deploy in thinking about\nthe direction and duration of time in cosmological models generally. For my\nlast task, I apply the same criteria to bounce cosmologies and show that Craig\nand Sinclair have been wrong to interpret bounce cosmologies as including a\nbeginning of physical reality.\n",

        "summary": "  The laws of nature have come a long way since the time of Newton: quantum\nmechanics and relativity have given us good reasons to take seriously the\npossibility of laws which may be non-local, atemporal, `all-at-once,'\nretrocausal, or in some other way not well-suited to the standard dynamical\ntime evolution paradigm. But many extant realist approaches to lawhood are\nbased on the paradigm of Newtonian laws, and thus they face significant\nchallenges when we try to apply them to laws outside the time evolution\npicture. In light of these developments, we are in need of a new approach to\nlawhood which is better suited for laws outside the time evolution paradigm. In\nthe present paper, we argue that this can be achieved within an approach which\nconceptualizes lawhood in terms of modal structure, and we set out a general\nframework in which the modal structure associated with a wide class of possible\nlaws can be expressed and studied.\n",

By type of sundial, it is closest to the analemmatic sundial. However,\nthe principle of the hourly markings of the Belogorsk slab is so unique that it\nis proposed to separate this type of sundial into a new type - inverted\nanalemmatic sundial. This type is characterized by the fact that, unlike\ntypical analemmatic sundials, the gnomon remains motionless throughout the\nyear, and in accordance with the analemma, the \"dial\" \"moves\" - an ellipse of\nhour markers from cup marks, i.e. gnomon and hour markers (cup marks) change\nplaces in terms of mobility. The movement of hour markers on the Belogorsk slab\nis not literal, but is imitated by several rows of cup marks, which are\nfragments of hour marker ellipses for different months of the year. The idea\nbehind this type of sundial is so revolutionary that we can talk about the\ndiscovery of a completely new type of sundial, the analogue of which has not\nyet been discovered.

By analyzing the mathematical properties of this epistemic function,\nwe interpret it to be in principle insensitive to any ontic state of the world,\nwhich leads to the conclusion that the observer is subject to temporal\nexperience irrespective of whether the underlying state of the world is\ndynamical or invariant. On the ground of the presented analysis, we also\nprovide a solution to the conceptual challenge of non-equilibrium phenomena\nthat faces the thermal time hypothesis.\n",

The statue was moved to a newly created garden in1982, which in the\nsubsequent decades accelerated the forgetting of its existence. The forgetting\nof the statue by the local people is related by chance to a historic event in\nthe Marshall Islands. Prof. Yukawa's visit to attend the unveiling ceremony\noccurred just after news that Japanese fishermen were heavily injured by atomic\ntesting at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. At the news conference when\nhe arrived at Kochi, he was unexpectedly asked about his attitude to the bomb\ntesting by the US. He was considered to be the foremost top scientist in\nnuclear science in Japan at that time, having been awarded the Nobel Prize for\nphysics in 1949. People in Kochi were very anxious about the test since many\nfishermen worked near Bikini Atoll. Contrary to the expectation of local\npeople, he refused to comment on the matter at the news conference and in\npublic lectures, which were held several times during his stay in Kochi. After\nreturning to Kyoto, he issued the famous statement titled Nuclear Era and the\nTurning Point of Mankind in an influential national newspaper. This was a time\nin Prof. Yukawa's life when he had to reflect and consult his conscience, and\nhe chose to take a principled stance that became a turning point in his life.\nAfter the visit to Kochi, he devoted himself with his wife to the peace\nmovement against nuclear weapons. Looking back, it can be observed that the\nvisit in 1954 to attend the unveiling ceremony of his bronze statue in Kochi\nmarked the start of that change. The statue can be seen to symbolize not only\nhis Nobel Prize but also the turning point in his life that led him to support\nthe peace movement against nuclear weapons.\n",

Although a qualitative description was possible\nby the Curie-Weiss theory it was obvious that a microscopic model was necessary\nto explain the tendency of the elementary magnetons to prefer parallel ordering\nat low temperatures. Such a model was proposed in 1922 by W. Schottky within\nthe old Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum mechanics and claimed to explain the high\nvalues of the Curie temperatures of certain ferromagnets. Based on this idea\nIsing formulated a new model for ferromagnetism in solids. Simultaneously the\nold quantum mechanics was replaced by new concepts of Heisenberg and\nSchr\\\"odinger and the discovery of spin. Thus Schottky's idea was outperformed\nand finally replaced in 1928 by Heisenberg exchange interaction. This led to a\nreformulation of Ising's model by Pauli at the Solvay conference in 1930.\nNevertheless one might consider Schottky's idea as a forerunner of this\ndevelopment explaining and asserting that the main point is the Coulomb energy\nleading to the essential interaction of neighboring elementary magnets.\n",

Here\nwe summarize the formalism behind G\\\"unther's theory and apply it to two\nwell-known examples from physics where different observers operate in distinct\nand only locally valid logical systems. Using polycontextural logic we show how\nthe emerging awareness of these limitations of logical systems entails the\ndesign of mathematical transformations, which then become an integral part of\nthe theory. In our view, this approach offers a novel perspective on the\nstructure of physical theories and, at the same time, emphasizes the relevance\nof the theory of polycontexturality in modern sciences.\n",

Here I propose a special or restricted theory of regularity. The main\ndifference as to the well-known version of that theory is both the range of\nvalidity and the scale of the laws of nature. Laws of nature ought to be\nconsidered just inside the observable universe and within certain energy and\nlength scales. Even so I apply the theory of regularity to the multiverse\nscenario. As a consequence, the special theory of regularity supports only two\ntypes of multiverses by comparison with our world: those ones with a different\nsequence of unique events and different laws of nature and those ones with the\nsame sequence of unique events and the same laws of nature instanced by the\nunique events. The latter case is some sort of eternal recurrence or a parallel\neternal recurrence.\n",

Writing in the treatise Mundus Jovialis,\nMayr made his assertion in a convoluted but unequivocal manner, earning the\ndispleasure of Galileo Galilei, who published his harsh protest in 1623 in Il\nSaggiatore. Though objections of Galileo were fallacious in some respects, and\nthough numerous scholars took to the field to prove claim of Mayr, none ever\nreally succeeded, and the historical evidence remains to detriment of Mayr. On\nthe basis of such historical evidence, including comparisons between Mundus\nJovialis and earlier works of Mayr, independent discovery of the satellites by\nMayr can be ruled out. Indeed, it is very likely that he never observed them\nbefore 30 December 1610, nearly a year after Galileo. The absence of a corpus\nof observations by Mayr and the inaccuracy of his tables are also puzzling.\n",

Although this statistical relationship is well quantified, the\ninterpretations have remained controversial, with many split between the\nclassical Copenhagen interpretation and some variation of the de Broglie-Bohm\npilot wave models. Recent experiments with Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs (HQAs)\nhave demonstrated that droplets of real fluid may achieve stable dynamical\nstates, where interaction of the droplets with their own ripples results in\nmotion analogous to the motion of particles subject to the guiding equation\nunder the pilot wave models. Indeed, many effects previously thought to be\nexclusively quantum have now been observed as emergent phenomena in these\nmacroscopic HQAs. This has motivated us to explore the possibility that quantum\nmechanics may actually be the result of fluid dynamics on some real quantum\nscale fluid. In this paper, we show that if there is a real quantum scale fluid\nhaving dynamics analogous to the fluid in HQAs, then this fluid must be a\nsuperfluid, and the dynamics of that fluid must take place on the surface of a\n4-dimensional hypersphere. Under the influence of cosmological inflation, we\nfurther show that these bouncing droplets would have the illusion of a property\nanalogous to rest mass, and that the principles of inertia, momentum,\nmass-energy equivalence, general relativity, the uncertainty principle and the\nappearance of a time-like dimension can all be derived for droplets as purely\nemergent phenomena from the fluid dynamics of this system.

In an appraisal of\nthe de-Broglie-Bohm theory, the paper discusses the crucial epistemological and\nconceptual role that a primitive ontology plays within a physical theory.

        "summary": "  Voyages of exploration often included astronomers among their crew to aid\nwith maritime navigation. William Dawes, a British Marine who had been trained\nin practical astronomy, was assigned to the \"First Fleet\", a convoy of eleven\nships that left England in May 1787 bound for Botany Bay (Sydney, Australia).\nDawes was also expected to take measurements of the local gravitational\nacceleration, $g$, at any port of call by measuring the daily rate by which his\nShelton pendulum clock differed from that at Greenwich, its calibration\nlocation. Although Dawes and Nevil Maskelyne, Britain's fifth Astronomer Royal,\nhad planned to obtain clock-rate measurements in the Canary Islands, San\nSebastian (Rio de Janeiro) and Table Bay, Captain Arthur Phillip, Commander of\nthe First Fleet, only allowed Dawes to disembark the clock in Rio de Janeiro.\nTherefore, we have just one set of clock-rate measurements from the voyage, in\naddition to land-based measurements obtained in New South Wales. If gravity was\nthe dominant factor affecting the clock's changing rate, Dawes' measurement of\n$-48.067$ sec per (sidereal) day obtained in Rio de Janeiro implies a local\ngravitational acceleration, $g = 9.7946$ m sec$^{-2}$. On the other hand, if we\nadopt the modern value, $g = 9.7878$ m s$^{-2}$, the implied daily decay rate\nis almost exactly 30 sec greater than Dawes' clock-rate determination, a\ndifference that is well in excess of the prevailing uncertainties. This\nsuggests that the pendulum's regulator nut may have been offset by a full turn,\nthus implying that our assumptions regarding the pendulum length may have to be\nrevisited.\n",

This paper formulates this\nassumption as a macroscopic law of increasing complexity and presents a\nhypothesis that this macroscopic law emerges in the universe. For this\nformulation, we represent any object of complexity as the source of the\nobserved value of the object, which is a probability distribution and treated\nin a unified manner for various objects. To define the degree of complexity, we\nutilize a quantitative definition of the complexity of organized matters,\norganized complexity [15]. We then apply this hypothesis to the fine-tuning\nproblem of the universe about the fundamental physical constants, which appear\nto be fine-tuned for life. This hypothesis explains the problem such that the\nfundamental physical constants are fine-tuned for the emergence of this\nmacroscopic law, which would be more plausible and clearly defined than for\nlife. An (approximate) reduction of this macroscopic law to fundamental\nphysical laws would certify this law and concretely evaluate the conditions of\nthe fundamental physical constants so that this law emerges.\n",

        "summary": "  The view of nature we adopt in the natural attitude is determined by common\nsense, without which we could not survive. Classical physics is modelled on\nthis common-sense view of nature, and uses mathematics to formalise our natural\nunderstanding of the causes and effects we observe in time and space when we\nselect subsystems of nature for modelling. But in modern physics, we do not go\nbeyond the realm of common sense by augmenting our knowledge of what is going\non in nature. Rather, we have measurements that we do not understand, so we\nknow nothing about the ontology of what we measure. We help ourselves by using\nentities from mathematics, which we fully understand ontologically. But we have\nno ontology of the reality of modern physics; we have only what we can assert\nmathematically. In this paper, we describe the ontology of classical and modern\nphysics against this background and show how it relates to the ontology of\ncommon sense and of mathematics.\n",

What\nis usually referred to as the block universe then emerges by noting that part\nof the future is contained in the present, but without the limitations that the\nfour-dimensional block universe usually implies, of a reality in which change\nwould be impossible. In our operational approach, reality remains dynamic, with\nfree choice playing a central role in its conceptualization. We therefore claim\nthat Einstein's relativity revolution has not been fully realized, since most\nphysicists do not seem to be open to the idea that objects move not only in\nspace, but also and especially in time, and more generally in spacetime, with\ntheir rest mass being a measure of their kinetic time energy. When relativistic\nmotion is revisited as a genuine four-dimensional motion, it becomes possible\nto reinterpret the parameter c associated with the coordinate speed of light,\nwhich becomes the magnitude of the four-velocity of all material entities. We\nalso observe that the four-dimensional motion in Minkowski space can be better\nunderstood if placed in the broader perspective of quantum mechanics, if\nnon-locality is interpreted as non-spatiality, thus indicating the existence of\nan underlying non-spatial reality, the nature of which could be conceptual,\nconsistent with the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics. This\nhypothesis is reinforced by noting that when observers, or experiencers, as\nthey will be referred to in this article, are described by acknowledging their\ncognitive nature, of entities moving in a semantic space, Minkowski metric\nemerges in a natural way.\n",

The latter was not explicitly\nexplained by Weyl, and corresponds to the \"truly objective\" aspect of \"rational\nmotives\".

Should we extend our notions of space and time beyond\nthe epistemological roles they play in helping us codify the dynamical behavior\nof matter? Kant famously answered ``No'' to both of these questions, contra\nNewton and Leibniz. This paper introduces novel technical and philosophical\nsupport for such a (Neo-)Kantian perspective on the metaphysics of space and\ntime. To begin, I will make an explicit analogy between broadly Humean views of\nlaws (e.g., Lewis, Demarest, etc.) and dynamics-first views of geometry (e.g.,\nBrown). I will then continue this line of analogous views beyond the\nmetaphysics of laws debate and the dynamical vs geometric spacetime debate by\nextending it into the context of spacetime topology. Namely, I will put forward\na dynamics-first view of topology (in answer to Norton's problem of\npre-geometry).\n  This dynamics-first view of topology is supported by some powerful new\ntechniques for topological redescription which I have recently developed in\nGrimmer (2023a) and Grimmer (2023b), namely the ISE Method. These new\ntechniques allow us to remove and replace the topological underpinnings of our\nspacetime theories just as easily as we can switch between different coordinate\nsystems. For instance, a theory set on a M\\\"obius strip might be redescribed as\nbeing set on the Euclidean plane and vice versa. Indeed, as Grimmer (2023b) has\nproved, the ISE Method gives us access to effectively every possible spacetime\nframing of a given theory's kinematical and dynamical content. Given this\noverabundance of candidate spacetime framings, it is then conceivable that one\ncan pick out a theory's topological structure via something analogous to a Best\nSystems Analysis.\n",

In this article an\nattemp is made to construct an approximate model of how the cycles of\nastronomical bodies' visible rotation aaffected the writing of history and\nself-representation of the Roman empire's powerful people. It is argued that\nwhile rare outstanding events like solar eclipses might have caused a short\nstir in the minds of the rulers and their environment, long-term cycles based\non the synchronization of the Moon's phases with the solar calendar and the\ncycles of the planets lining up in the same disposition (in relationship to the\nMoon or without this relationship) were the foundation of astronomy-based\nChristian chronological system. The emergence of the Christian historical\nworldview in the 5th century was marked by appearance of a significant\neschatological strain in it. Historians paid attention not only to the\ntheology-defined signs of the end of the world, but also, as it has been\nsuggested in modern studies, to the some outstanding celestial phenomena. In\nthis paper I would like to address several criteria which may help understand\nwhat in the celestial motions interested the astronomers and historians of the\n5th century. This paper uses the first approximation of astronomical data for\nsolving the problem of how relevant the skies were for historians, although all\nnumeric parameters are taken from the up-to-date astronomy reference\npublications. It is an attempt to understand whether the very basic\napproximations can be related to what historians know from the array of sources\navailable to them. The analysis suggests that there is a whole array of\noccasions when the dates of astronomical events, received with the help of\nthese basic approximations, coincide with the data from historical sources.\n",

Then, the ambition of the present article is to augment Duhem's\ndemonstration with historical evidence relating precisely to the question of\nthe speed of light in water. We will review the four major opinions on the\nnature of light developed between 1637 and 1801; all leading to theories\nconcluding that the ratio of sines is constant and equal to the ratio of the\nvelocities in the two media, but all being defended by at least two authors\nconcluding to inverse ratios of those velocities -- and thus to opposite\npredictions on the result of an experiment such as Foucault's.

However, in 1913, Einstein discarded these\nequations in favor of the non-covariant \"Entwurf\" field equations. This shift\nwas a crucial step in his path to the final theory of general relativity, which\nhe eventually achieved in 1915. This analysis explores Einstein's evolving\nideas and decisions regarding the mathematical framework of his theory of\ngravity during the critical period 1912-1916. My findings in this paper\nhighlight that Einstein's brilliance did not exist in isolation but thrived\nwithin a vibrant scientific discourse. His work was significantly enriched\nthrough contributions and discussions with friends and colleagues, notably\nMichele Besso and Marcel Grossmann, illustrating the collaborative essence of\nscientific advancement. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that while\nthese individuals made substantial contributions, they did not share an equal\nrole in shaping the fundamental framework of general relativity, which remained\npredominantly Einstein's intellectual creation.

In this manuscript, we explore the\nhistorical development of the Navier-Stokes equation and its profound impact on\nFluid Dynamics over the past two centuries. From Navier's initial insights to\nGeorge Stokes' experimental validations and subsequent contributions by other\nscientists, we trace the evolution of this equation. We also delve into its\npractical applications, including its role in the development of Computational\nFluid Dynamics. The Navier-Stokes equation has played a pivotal role in\nadvancing our understanding of fluid behavior, making it a cornerstone of\nmodern science and engineering.\n",

Concern for\nScripture and for the fallible and consequential nature of science, together\nwith the processes used by the Vatican in these confrontations, inevitably led\nto messy results in these well-known \"religion and science\" confrontations.\nNevertheless, these confrontations suggest that what the Vatican was attempting\nto do in confronting evolution or heliocentrism is something that is needed in\nscience, and something that will be done in the future, probably not by the\nVatican, and probably in a fashion not less messy.\n",

This original theory of the\nheavens was written in dialogue with the conceptions of celestial matter of his\ntime. On the one hand, Kant recognized Descartes' cosmological enterprise as a\ndecisive mechanistic requirement for the intelligence of physics, but his\nvortices of matter fell into disrepute: Newton invalidated them mathematically.\nOn the other hand, attraction at a distance provides an incomparable\nexplanation of phenomena, but has left a gaping hole in our understanding of\nthe law's material anchorage in bodies, and ultimately sends the question of\nhow the system works back to God. He then set out to overcome the dichotomy\nestablished by these two authors, drawing on the Cartesian adage ''give me\nmatter and I'll make a world'', but applying Newton's laws to cosmogenesis. In\nconcrete terms, interplanetary space currently contains no matter capable of\nexplaining the motion of the stars, we need to look further back into the\nsystem's past, to find an earlier state of material dispersion whose effects\nare still being felt. He must assume the existence of a cloud of dust, made up\nof the simplest elements and moved by the forces of attraction and repulsion\nalone. From this, Kant can form the hypothesis of the primitive nebula breaking\ndown first into a phase of stellogenesis, and then into the creation of an\naccretion disk gradually forming the planets and their satellites.\n",

He could successfully account for\nthe Wiedemann-Franz law which states that the ratio of thermal to electrical\nconductivity divided by temperature is a constant called the Lorenz number. As\nit turns out, in Drude's derivation, there is a lucky cancellation of two\nerrors. Drude's under-estimate (by an order of 100) of the value of square of\nthe average electron velocity compensated his over-estimate of the electronic\nheat capacity (by the same order of 100). This compensation or cancellation of\ntwo errors lead to a value of the Lorenz number very close to its experimental\nvalue. This is well known. There is another error of a factor of two which\nDrude made when he calculated two different relaxation times for heat\nconductivity and electrical conductivity. In this article we highlight how and\nwhy this error occurred in Drude's derivation and how it was removed 5 years\nlater (that is in 1905) by Hendrik Lorentz when he used the Boltzmann equation\nand a single relaxation time. This article is of pedagogical value and may be\nuseful to undergraduate/graduate students learning solid state physics.\n",

Less\nknown is the fact that the thesis defended by Ernst Ising 100 years ago (in\n1924) contained not only the solution of what we call now the `classical 1D\nIsing model' but also other problems. Some of these problems, as well as the\nmethod of their solution, are the subject of this note. In particular, we\ndiscuss the combinatorial method Ernst Ising used to calculate the partition\nfunction for a chain of elementary magnets. In the thermodynamic limit, this\nmethod leads to the result that the partition function is given by the roots of\na certain polynomial. We explicitly show that `Ising's roots' that arise within\nthe combinatorial treatment are also recovered by the eigenvalues of the\ntransfer matrix, a concept that was introduced much later. Moreover, we discuss\nthe generalization of the two-state model to a three-state one presented in\nIsing's thesis, but not included in his famous paper of 1925 (E. Ising,\nZ.Physik 31 (1925) 253). The latter model can be considered as a forerunner of\nthe now abundant models with many-component order parameters.\n",

While objectivism is only\nchallenged through proposing the mildest form of subjectivism, determinism is\nstructurally disputed by proposing that the physical reality, at least in the\nexamples discussed, is, in essence, probabilistic and unpredictable. It is\ndiscussed that the physical reality and experimenter's identification of it\ncould basically have inconsistent characteristics, and the study of the\nphysical reality can therefore be conducted in ontic and epistemic levels,\nleading to two distinct identifications. Four scientific topics, showing two\ndifferent types of indeterminacy, are introduced and briefly reviewed: chaotic\nsystems, turbulence, fluid transport in porous media, and hydromechanics of\nfractures. It is proposed that determinism is only meaningful in epistemic\nlevel, the first two examples are ontically indeterministic, the last two\nexamples are epistemically indeterministic, and more examples of\nindeterministic phenomena could, most likely, be found in the nature.\nIndeterminacy of the physical reality, it is discussed, has always been\nconsidered in engineering design processes and such effects have normally been\ncovered through safety factors and feedback loops. By reviewing Hadamard's\nwell-posedness criteria, Poincae's complete deterministic approach, and\nLeibniz's principles of sufficient reason and identity of indiscernibles, it is\nclaimed that positivism stands on Leibniz's metaphysical assumptions, which are\nnot necessarily in full agreement with the physical reality. A few suggestions\nfor a path beyond positivism in Newtonian mechanics are finally provided.\n",

One, showing him at his desk, decorates the Kapteyn Room in the\nKapteyn Astronomical Institute, and the other one, displaying him in academic\nattire, is in the University's gallery of professors in the central Academy\nBuilding. The first was offered to the Kapteyns on the occasion of his 40-th\nanniversary as professor in 1918 and the second to the University after his\nretirement in 1921.\n  It has been suggested that there must have been a third portrait that now is\nlost. Former director Adriaan Blaauw has proposed that the one in the Academy\nBuilding actually was first offered in 1918, but at Mrs. Kapteyn's request\nreplaced by the one now in the Kapteyn Room. The first version was then later\nadapted to the requirements of the gallery of professors by Veth himself by\noverpainting it with academic attire. A preliminary trial version by Veth, in\nthe possession of Kapteyn's greatgrandson, shows what it would have looked like\nbefore the adaption.\n  The following reports on new evidence: the biography of Jan Veth that\nhistorian Johan Huizinga, friend of Veth, wrote, and letters Veth wrote to his\nwife while he was working on these paintings. This provides strong support of\nBlaauw's sequence of events with a few modifications. No third painting has\never been produced.\n",

        "summary": "  We re-examine the common narrative that a 1941 experimental error by\nphysicists Walther Bothe and Peter Jensen led Germany to abandon graphite as a\nreactor moderator during World War II. We first detail the history of both\nGerman and American graphite experiments, noting that the Americans faced\nsimilar setbacks but succeeded only at the end of a costly 18-month graphite\npurification program. We then use Monte Carlo N-Particle simulations to\nreconstruct Bothe's 1941 experiment. We find the thermal absorption cross\nsection of Bothe's Siemens electrographite to be 12.2 mb, in contrast to his\nreported 7.9 mb. This discrepancy arises because the neutrons in Bothe's\nexperiment did not reach thermal equilibrium, leading to an underestimation of\nneutron absorption. Additionally, despite misconceptions that the Germans were\nunaware of boron impurities, we share evidence that Wilhelm Hanle accurately\nmeasured boron and cadmium impurities in the electrographite. To support our\nfindings, we provide 9 excerpted and 3 complete English translations of\nclassified wartime reports by Heisenberg, Joos, Bothe, Jensen, H\\\"ocker, Hanle,\nand Kremer. Our work aims to illuminate the rational constraints behind\nGermany's decision to forgo graphite moderation.\n",

Faced with several decades of\nexperimental confirmation of all theories lacking, we subject four aesthetic\ncriteria - simplicity, symmetry, elegance, and inevitability -, regularly\nmentioned in theory evaluation, to critical examination. We find that these\ncriteria, all of which can be reduced to a desire for simplicity, have\nrepeatedly misled modern particle physics. This is largely due to the lack of\nmetatheoretical permanence of a uniform conception of simplicity. The\nreductionist claim of particle physics - the search for simple fundamental\nprinciples in a complex world - will be worked out as the reason why this\ndiscipline is particularly susceptible to the aesthetic appeal of simplicity.\nThus, compared to disciplines dealing with complex phenomena, aesthetic\ncriteria are much more frequently applied, exposing particle physics to the\nrisk of missteps and dead ends.\n",

This article grapples with those questions, arguing that\nthe concerns can be overcome through a close analysis of the laws of classical\nmechanics and electromagnetism. The view that laws produce the future seems to\nrequire that the laws of nature take a certain form, fitting what Adlam has\ncalled \"the time evolution paradigm.\" Making that paradigm precise, we might\ndemand that there be temporally local dynamical laws that take properties of\nthe present and the arbitrarily-short past as input, returning as output\nchanges in such properties into the arbitrarily-short future. In classical\nmechanics, Newton's second law can be fit into this form if we follow a\nproposal from Easwaran and understand the acceleration that appears in the law\nto capture how velocity (taken to be a property of the present and the\narbitrarily-short past) changes into the arbitrarily-short future. The\ndynamical laws of electromagnetism can be fit into this form as well, though\nbecause electromagnetism is a special relativistic theory we might require that\nthe laws meet a higher standard: linking past light-cone to future light-cone.\nWith some work, the laws governing the evolution of the vector and scalar\npotentials in the Lorenz gauge, as well as the evolution of charged matter, can\nbe put in a form that meets this higher standard.\n",

        "summary": "  The present work examines and compares the approaches of Jacob Bernoulli and\nLeonhard Euler to the problem of ship propulsion generated by internal forces.\nJacob Bernoulli's analysis, developed in the late 17th century, relies on\ngeometric interpretations and algebraic relationships to estimate the impulse\nexerted by a pendulum within a ship. His results, however, are shown to\noverestimate the force by scaling it with the height of fall rather than the\nvelocity at the end of the fall and by amplifying it with a time dependence\nfactor that proves to be erroneous. Euler's subsequent analysis, conducted\nnearly 50 years later, provides a more rigorous and mechanically sound\ntreatment of the problem. Utilizing differential equations and a deeper\nunderstanding of the principles of motion, Euler demonstrates that no net\nmotion can be generated by internal forces alone, thus refuting the concept of\nperpetual motion as proposed by Jacob Bernoulli. By comparing the two\nmethodologies, this work highlights the evolution of mathematical and physical\nanalysis from the intuitive but flawed approaches of the early calculus\npioneers to the more precise and reliable methods established by later\nmathematicians. Euler's work not only corrects the errors in Jacob Bernoulli's\nanalysis but also solidifies the understanding that propulsion requires\nexternal forces, a conclusion consistent with the laws of Newtonian mechanics.\n",

My defence is broadly pragmatic, in the sense that\nadherence to something like Hume's dictum delivers at least three benefits. The\nfirst benefit is that, through Hume's dictum, a physical theory's ontology\ndelimits a range of possibilities, that I call \\emph{kinematical\npossibilities}, which serves as a sufficiently permissive notion of possibility\nto sustain something like an intensional semantics for its claims, and a\nsufficiently demanding notion of supervenience to sustain plausible claims of\ninter-theoretic reduction and theoretical equivalence. The second benefit is\nthat Hume's dictum allows us to work backwards from a range of kinematical\npossibilities to an ontology. This is especially useful when aiming to glean an\ninterpretation of a physical theory, since often we are more confident that we\nhave arrived at the right space of possibilities than that we have arrived at\nthe right ontology. The third benefit is that Hume's dictum -- at least the\nversion I aim to defend here -- may be applied to physical theories more or\nless as we find them, and therefore we can practice something resembling\nontology without having to force our theories into some Procrustean bed, such\nas a first-order language.\n",

Considering some objections against this view, I\nshall argue that the most appropriate definition of a physical theory already\npresupposes some commitments shared by a philosophical position associated with\nscientific realism.

Based on this\nfactive/non-factive distinction, we shall finally present a case study in\nphysics in order to show that a well-known foundational problem associated with\nthe concept of manifest time can be dissolved once the non-factive notion of\nempirical adequacy (as opposed to factive one) is endorsed.\n",

In the context of quantum gravity this is called \"the problem of time\".\nA crucial difference is that time $t$ may be seen as an observable in\nrelativity theory, just like position $x$, whereas in quantum theory $t$ is a\nparameter, in contrast to the observable $x$. Aiming to resolve the\ndiscrepancy, a formalization of time in the spirit of Kant's Copernican\nrevolution is suggested, where it is required that the treatment of time in\nphysics agree with our cognition. This leads to reconsideration of the notions\nof identity and change of objects, as well as the nature of physical states and\ntheir evolution. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and\nrelational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of\n$n$, which is updated each time an event occurs. The role of $t$ is to quantify\ndistances between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with\neach $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal\ndistances between present and past events. A universal ordering of events in\nterms of $n$ can be postulated even though distances $t$ are relativistic. In\nshort, it is argued that time as a sequential flow of events should be\nseparated from time as a measure of distance between events. In physical\nmodels, these aspects of time can be expressed as one evolution parameter and\none observable, respectively.\n",

Some of Wolfram's personal work relating to his physics project\nis philosophical, and so mechanics of particular phenomena in the natural world\ncan become a triviality or an aside. In other words, the general theory \"casts\na wide net\", and it is the philosophical topics I will challenge. I find that\nWolfram must adopt a radical epistemology through his so-called Observer Theory\nbecause there is no clear notion of Truth. Tegmark believes in an objective\nTruth, but I find its relation to the observer untenable, and the proof of his\nMathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) is gematria. I argue both Wolfram and\nTegmark conflate the inherent potential of mathematical truths with their\ninstantiation or actuality in reality, making a similar error to that of the\n\"so-called\" Pythagoreans rebuked by Aristotle.

We think that we\nfound the constellation Taurus on the Disc, which forms by addition of three\nstars from the constellation Gemini the pattern of a plough of Bronze Age.\nMoreover we found a line on the disc consisting of the stars epsilon Gem, theta\nAur, beta Aur and alpha Aur, which we called the Auriga line. We think that the\nNebra people used the Auriga line to determine the day (which we call beta day)\non which the Pleiades are vertically below beta Aur at dusk in February. We\nfound a second representation of the Auriga line on the Disc where the distance\nratios between the stars are very precisely equal to the distance ratios in the\nsky, and where the Pleiades are vertically below beta Aur. This proves that the\nNebra people must have measured the distances, and that our hypothesis is\ncorrect.\n  The beta day could have been used to harmonize a lunisolar calendar with the\nsolar year. However, the most likely possibility seems to us that a good sowing\ndate could be determined by setting the sowing on the second round lunar phase\nafter the beta day. (By round lunar phases we mean the full moon and the new\nmoon.) Such a sowing date makes it possible to start a week count based on the\nlunar phases with the sowing in order to determine other agricultural dates.\n  The astronomical knowledge for this procedure can be gained by astronomical\nobservations only.

An intense correspondence between Hilbert and Einstein in the crucial\nmonth of November 1915, furthermore, confronts the historian with a case of\nparallel research and with the associated problem of reconstructing the\ninteraction between Hilbert and Einstein at that time.\n  Previous assessments of these issues have recently been challenged by Leo\nCorry, J\\\"urgen Renn, and John Stachel who draw attention to a hitherto\nunnoticed first set of proofs for Hilbert's note. These proofs bear a printer's\nstamp of December 6 and display substantial differences to the published\nversion. By focussing on the consequences of these findings for the\nreconstruction of Einstein's path towards general relativity, a number of\nquestions about Hilbert's role in the episode, however, are left open. To what\nextent did Hilbert react to Einstein? What were Hilbert's research concerns in\nhis note, and how did they come to overlap with Einstein's to some extent in\nthe fall of 1915? How did Hilbert and Einstein regard each other and their\nconcurrent activities at the time? What did Hilbert hope to achieve, and what,\nafter all, did he achieve?\n  With these questions in mind I discuss in this paper Hilbert's first note on\nthe ``Foundations of Physics,'' its prehistory and characteristic features,\nand, for heuristic purposes, I do so largely from Hilbert's perspective.\n",

A related triumph a deep understanding of the\nforces of interaction. In particular, it has been possible to understand the\nfour fundamental forces of nature in an elegant and unified mathematical\nframework. The paradigm for this unification has been the principle of gauge\nsymmetry.\n  A new approach to achieving further unification relies on Supersymmetry. This\nis a symmetry which relates particles of integer spin with those of\nhalf-integral spin and also dictates the allowed interactions among these\nparticles. However, no data exist pointing to the presence of this symmetry; it\nmay indeed be of no relevance to nature.\n  In this paper the gauge principle and unification attempts are briefly\nreviewed, and then Supersymmetry is introduced. The notion of \"broken\" symmetry\nis discussed, which may explain why the symmetry is difficult to observe at\npresently accessible energies. But a badly broken manifestation seems to remove\nmuch of the original appeal and elegance of the theory. We here propose two\nalternative views of the status of Supersymmetry from fundamental standpoint.\nThere is a good reason why it is indeed a fundamental symmetry, despite badly\nbroken. The alternative is that it is an organizing principle, somewhat like\nvalence. This makes it valuable as a signpost to new Physics.\n",

Prevailing wisdom indicates that women, historically, have not\nexcelled in the mathematics and sciences, for various reasons. These range from\nsocietal pressures to marry and bear children, to a lack of systematic\nscientific education for females, to the lack of opportunity in institutions\nand industry. Women, until comparatively recently, were not in control of their\nown financial lives, and were therefore dependent upon the goodwill of a\nhusband, father or brother, should they attempt to enter academic life. Many\ntimes, their accomplishments, and the accomplishments of these collaborating\nrelatives, become so merged as to become indistinguishable. Nevertheless, with\nall these factors working against them, history records an occasional bright\nstar. Their diaries, memoirs and correspondence detail both the similarities\nand the differences between their roles and the roles of modern female\nscientists, in their own minds, and in the estimation of those closest to them.\nThere exists, in science, a dichotomy between the desire to understand one's\nuniverse, and the desire to change the understanding of others. These two\nfundamental desires lead future scientists to the discipline. Historically, the\nrole of women has largely been interpretive, rather than innovative, by their\nown estimation.

I\nshall also show that the solar zodiac (rashis) was used in Vedic India and I\nshall present a plausible derivation of the symbols of the solar zodiac from\nthe deities of the lunar segments.

Therefore, an increase\nin knowledge would lead to a decrease in the necessity of faith. Further, it is\nargued that, ideally speaking, a full knowledge of the laws of nature would\nmake obsolete any sort of religious faith and would ultimately allow a complete\ncontrol of nature by man. Since referring to nature, such views must be founded\nin the natural sciences of which physics is the most fundamental. Therefore,\nthe question whether such views are compatible with the current state of\nnatural sciences is ultimately decided in physics. Indeed, it is likely that\nthese simplistic views have their origin in the world view generated by the\nsuccesses of Newtonian physics from the middle of the 17th century until the\nbeginning of the 20th century which viewed the physical world as a type of\nmechanical clock in which the motion of the gears affect each other in a\nprecise and predictable way.

One such notion that is\ndiscussed is the model of electric conductivity implied by Drude's electron\ntheory of metals, and the derivation of the Wiedemann-Franz law within this\nframework. After summarizing the experimental knowledge on superconductivity\naround 1920, the topic is then discussed both on a phenomenological level in\nterms of implications of Maxwell's equations for the case of infinite\nconductivity, and on a microscopic level in terms of suggested models for\nsuperconductive charge transport. Analyzing Einstein's manuscripts and\ncorrespondence as well as his own 1922 paper on the subject, it is shown that\nEinstein had a sustained interest in superconductivity and was well informed\nabout the phenomenon. It is argued that his appointment as special professor in\nLeiden in 1920 was motivated to a considerable extent by his perception as a\nleading theoretician of quantum theory and condensed matter physics and the\nhope that he would contribute to the theoretical direction of the experiments\ndone at Kamerlingh Onnes' cryogenic laboratory. Einstein tried to lived up to\nthese expectations by proposing at least three experiments on the phenomenon,\none of which was carried out twice in Leiden. Compared to other theoretical\nproposals at the time, the prominent role of quantum concepts was\ncharacteristic of Einstein's understanding of the phenomenon.

Albert\nEinstein understood that the solution to the crisis required an audacious\nreworking of the concepts of space and time. Special Relativity deeply modified\nour way of regarding space and time, in order to harmonize electromagnetism\nwith the principle of relativity. As a consequence, lengths and elapsed times\nwere stripped of the invariant character that classical Physics conferred them;\nin their place, the speed of light acquired that privileged status. Such\nrevolutionary change forced Einstein to reformulate Newtonian mechanics, a step\nthat led him to discover the mass-energy equivalence.\n",

To find an\nequivalent phenomenon in the past we need to go back to the period from the XV\ncentury to the XVII century. It was not a mere reform of codes but a new code.\nIn 1905 the perception of reality changed through the introduction of\nrelativism in three levels of the reference systems: the ego-other relation,\nthe world perceived by the senses, and the 'ideal' universe of the concepts. We\nwill try to identify how this change was expressed and developed in the cited\nlevels, both in the physic and nature based sciences, in the social sciences,\nand in literature and fine arts. Today, 100 years after, the 1905's generation\nstill proposes us two options: to live sheltered by the dogma that reassures us\nwith its only and exclusive viewpoint claimed objective, or to dare to live\nwith the multiple, the transient, the relative. The first way led to the worst\nregimes and intolerant ideas of the XX century, the second option throws us\ninto the uncertainty of the creative adventure, but also leads us to the\npossibility of a fairer society in the XXI century.\n",

As an outcome of this scrutiny he was able to prove\nby the E.I.H. method that properly defined point charges, appended at the\nright-hand side of the field equation $R_{[[\\mu\\nu],\\lambda]}=0$, interact\nmutually with Coulomb-like forces, provided that a mutual force independent of\ndistance is present too. This unwanted, but unavoidable addition, could not but\nlay further disbelief on the efforts initiated by Einstein and Schroedinger one\ndecade earlier. However in 1980 Treder himself recalled that the potential\n$\\phi=a/r+cr$, found by him in 1957, was the one used by particle physicists to\naccount phenomenologically for the spectrum of bound quark systems like mesons.\nExact solutions have later confirmed beyond any doubt that Einstein's unified\nfield theory does account in a simple way, already in classical form, for the\nconfinement of pole charges defined by the four-current first availed of by\nTreder. In the present paper it is proposed, ad memoriam, a thorough\nrecollection of the article published by Treder in 1957, showing the way kept\nby him to find what would have been later recognized as confinement in\nEinstein's unified field theory.\n",

Repeated failure to observe the motion of\nearth through aether led Einstein to modify the Newtonian absolute space and\ntime concepts to a fused Minkowski space-time and the removal of aether from\nbasic ontological entities in his special theory of relativity. Later Einstein\nin his attempts to give a local theory of gravitation was led to further modify\nflat Minkowski space-time to the curved Riemannian space time. This reduced\ngravitational phenomenon to that of geometry of the space time. Space-time,\nmatter and fields all became dynamical.

Indeed, we focus on the\n``shades'' of Minkowski's text, i.e. what is missing, or misunderstood. In\nparticular, we focus on two issues: (i) why are Poincar\\'e's pioneering\ncontributions to four-dimensional geometry not quoted by Minkowski (while he\nabundantly quoted them a few months before the Cologne lecture)?, and (ii) did\nMinkowski fully grasp the physical (and existential) meaning of ``time'' within\nspacetime? We think that this ``negative'' approach (and the contrast between\nPoincar\\'e's and Minkowski's attitudes towards physics) allows one to better\ngrasp the boldness of the {\\it revolutionary} step taken by Minkowski in his\nCologne lecture.\n",

What was not known is that the first\nattempts to find that date were made during the early period of his life. The\nJewish National and University Library in Jerusalem contains two undated drafts\nin Latin under the same title, \"Rules for the Determination of Easter\", grouped\nas Yahuda MS 24E. The earlier draft contains multiple references to the\nvirtually forgotten \"De Annis Christi\" (1649), written by Villum Lange, the\n17th century Danish astronomer and theologian, who might have been Newton's\nfirst mentor on the Jewish calendar tradition. The second draft shows not only\nNewton's close acquaintance with Maimonides' theory of first lunar visibility,\nbut also his attempt to simplify the latter's criteria by introducing\ndifferent, more practical parameters. These \"astronomical exercises\", announced\nin a 1673 book, were likely intended to appear as an appendix to Nicholas\nMercator's 1676 book. Both of Yahuda 24E's drafts contain an astronomical table\nwith the solar and lunar positions for years 30-37, which Newton used to decide\non the year and date of the Passion. The astronomical data comes from either\n1651 \"Harmonicon Coeleste\" or 1669 \"Astronomia Britannica\" by Vincent Wing, a\nsemi-forgotten astronomer of the seventeenth century. This makes Yahuda 24E one\nof the earliest of Newton's drafts, likely written in 1669-73 and certainly not\nlater than 1683/4. A comparison of the two drafts of Yahuda 24E shows that in\nthe later one, Newton changed his allegiance from St. John's chronology of the\nPassion to that shown in the synoptic gospels.\n",

        "summary": "  In February 1700, Isaac Newton needed a precise tropical year to design a new\nuniversal calendar that would supersede the Gregorian one. However,\n17th-Century astronomers were uncertain of the long-term variation in the\ninclination of the Earth's axis and were suspicious of Ptolemy's equinox\nobservations. As a result, they produced a wide range of tropical years. Facing\nthis problem, Newton attempted to compute the length of the year on his own,\nusing the ancient equinox observations reported by a famous Greek astronomer\nHipparchus of Rhodes, ten in number. Though Newton had a very thin sample of\ndata, he obtained a tropical year only a few seconds longer than the correct\nlength. The reason lies in Newton's application of a technique similar to\nmodern regression analysis. Newton wrote down the first of the two so-called\n'normal equations' known from the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method. In that\nprocedure, Newton seems to have been the first to employ the mean (average)\nvalue of the data set, while the other leading astronomers of the era (Tycho\nBrahe, Galileo, and Kepler) used the median. Fifty years after Newton, in 1750,\nNewton's method was rediscovered and enhanced by Tobias Mayer. Remarkably, the\nsame regression method served with distinction in the late 1920s when the\nfounding fathers of modern cosmology, Georges Lemaitre (1927), Edwin Hubble\n(1929), and Willem de Sitter (1930), employed it to derive the Hubble constant.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper looks at the theory underlying the science of materials from the\nperspectives of physics, the history of science, and the philosophy of science.\nWe are particularly concerned with the development of understanding of the\nthermodynamic phases of matter. The question is how can matter, ordinary\nmatter, support a diversity of forms. We see this diversity each time we\nobserve ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor (steam) rise from a\npot of heated water. The nature of the phases is brought into the sharpest\nfocus in phase transitions: abrupt changes from one phase to another and hence\nchanges from one behavior to another. This article starts with the development\nof mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of phase transition\nphenomena. It then goes on to the limitations of mean field theory and the\ndevelopment of very different supplementary understanding through the\nrenormalization group concept.\n  Throughout, the behavior at the phase transition is illuminated by an\n\"extended singularity theorem\", which says that a sharp phase transition only\noccurs in the presence of some sort of infinity in the statistical system. The\nusual infinity is in the system size. Apparently this result caused some\nconfusion at a 1937 meeting celebrating van der Waals, since mean field theory\ndoes not respect this theorem. In contrast, renormalization theories can make\nuse of the theorem. This possibility, in fact, accounts for some of the\nstrengths of renormalization methods in dealing with phase transitions. The\npaper outlines the different ways phase transition phenomena reflect the\neffects of this theorem.\n",

He is mainly celebrated as the first\npersons to define correctly net yield and describe method for its optimization,\nwhich was considered \"strikingly modern\" still in 1950. Buquoy's program was\n\"systematic overview of all theorems which affect maintenance and increase of\nnational wealth\" for which he correctly defined and mathematically expressed\nmany economic terms. The most striking feature of Buquoy's writing is that he\nwas also a very influential economic practitioner. He governed one of the\nwealthiest possessions in Bohemia, and perhaps in Austria, of his time. Thus\nhis economical thinking expands from the \"political part\", which is economy in\nmodern sense, to \"...sources of national wealth, or the technical part of\nnational economy ...\". The complexity of Buquoy's view has little match in\nmodern literature namely because the extent of data sources is hardly available\nin modern times. The article puts Buquoy's mathematical economy contributions\nin context to his mathematical physics thoughts and approaches. The last direct\ncitation of Buquoy's work comes from the year 2008.\n",

While these\ncommentators are correct, the picture they present of the connections between\nBohr and Kant is painted in broad strokes; it is open to the criticism that\nthese affinities are merely superficial. In this essay, I provide a closer,\nstructural, analysis of both Bohr's and Kant's views that makes these\nconnections more explicit. In particular, I demonstrate the similarities\nbetween Bohr's argument, on the one hand, that neither the wave nor the\nparticle description of atomic phenomena pick out an object in the ordinary\nsense of the word, and Kant's requirement, on the other hand, that both\n'mathematical' (having to do with magnitude) and 'dynamical' (having to do with\nan object's interaction with other objects) principles must be applicable to\nappearances in order for us to determine them as objects of experience. I argue\nthat Bohr's 'Complementarity interpretation' of quantum mechanics, which views\natomic objects as idealizations, and which licenses the repeal of the principle\nof causality for the domain of atomic physics, is perfectly compatible with,\nand indeed follows naturally from a broadly Kantian epistemological framework.\n",

The problem is complicated by the existence of \"fringe\" and\n\"new-age\" views that are increasingly confused with, and even passed off as,\nindigenous perceptions. In a modern world where widespread public perceptions\ninclude many that are unscientific in the broadest sense of the term, I shall\nargue that there are actually a range of positive benefits for progress in\nscientific astronomy to be derived from the mutual awareness and comprehension\nof \"genuine\" cultural world-views whose goals-in common with those of modern\nscience-are to make sense of the cosmos within which people live.

PQT\nmakes sense of the quantum world. PQT recovers all the empirical success of OQT\nand is, furthermore, empirically testable (although not as yet tested). I argue\nthat Einstein almost put forward this version of quantum theory in 1916/17 in\nhis papers on spontaneous and induced radiative transitions, but retreated from\ndoing so because he disliked the probabilistic character of the idea.\nSubsequently, the idea was overlooked because debates about quantum theory\npolarised into the Bohr/Heisenberg camp, which argued for the abandonment of\nrealism and determinism, and the Einstein/Schr\\\"odinger camp, which argued for\nthe retention of realism and determinism, no one, as a result, pursuing the\nmost obvious option of retaining realism but abandoning determinism. It is this\nthird, overlooked option that leads to PQT. PQT has implications for quantum\nfield theory, the standard model, string theory, and cosmology. The really\nimportant point, however, is that it is experimentally testable. I indicate two\nexperiments in principle capable of deciding between PQT and OQT.\n",

Hess measured the rate of discharge of an electroscope\nthat flew aboard an atmospheric balloon. Because the discharge rate increased\nas the balloon flew at higher altitude, he concluded in 1912 that the origin\ncould not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize\nin 1936, and his experiment became legendary. At the same time, in 1911,\nPacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made a series of measurements to\ndetermine the variation in the speed of discharge of an electroscope (and thus\nthe intensity of the radiation) while the electroscope was immersed in a box in\na sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay of Livorno (the Italian Navy supported\nthe research). Pacini discovered that the discharge of the oscilloscope was\nsignificantly slower than at the surface.\n  Before his conclusive measurements, Pacini performed a series of experiments\nbetween 1907 and 1910, in particular by comparing radioactivity on ground and\non the sea surface a few kilometers off the coast. These experimennts gave\nmarginal indications on the presence of a non-terrestrial component,\nencouraging Pacini to continue his research till the conclusive results.

Indeed, as already shown by Higgs and Kibble, the mechanism can be\nexplained in terms of gauge invariant variables, without invoking spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. In this paper, we present a general discussion of such gauge\ninvariant treatments for the case of the Abelian Higgs model, in the context of\nclassical field theory.

Once he was\nhunting somewhere between Mtskheta (the ancient capital of Georgia) and\nKhashuri, near Mt. Tkhoti in dense woodland. It rapidly got dark and the Sun\ndisappeared from the sky. Mirian began to ask his traditional pagan gods, but\nto no avail. Then he addressed the god whom Nino from Cappadocia believed in\n(subsequently she became Saint Nino, a woman whose name is inseparably linked\nwith the spread of Christianity in Georgia) and there was a miracle; the\ndarkness suddenly disappeared and the Sun began shining in the sky again.

In the authors' opinion,\nthe eclipse seen by King Mirian happened on the evening of 6 May, 319 AD.\nLater, in May 320 AD, cypress crosses were made and raised.

Moreover the opening chapter argues that although\nexplanatory narratives are essentially epistemological constructions, they\nrequire a general metaphysical backing through the explainer's and explainee's\ncommitments to take the concepts and higher structures composed of them as\ndirectly referential. Two methodological perspectives on theory construction,\nEinstein's division into principle and constructive theories, are then\ndelineated along the lines of their metaphysical and explanatory potential, and\npresented as the research instrument with which to approach the\nspecific-case-study instances of quantum theory reconstruction. A specific\nstrategy of arguing for scientific realism ('the simple transcendental\nstrategy') is then presented and connected to the challenges that the phenomena\n(EPR correlations and 'teleportation') from the domain of contemporary quantum\ntheory pose for it. The opening chapter concludes with a survey of the general\nmodels of explanation and their position with respect to the\nprinciple-constructive dichotomy introduced above. Finally, an explanatory\nmodel containing extended material-like entities along with further primitives,\nuniversal laws of temporal evolution, is argued for. Consequently, in the\ninterest of a wholesome realistic response to the sceptical challenge about the\nexplanatory aims of science, we recommend that even the common sense conceptual\nframework replaces the extended material structure with 'generalised things' as\nre-identifiable invariants through change as the fundamental unit of the\nrealist ontology.\n",

At\nthe end of the 1920s, Bothe and Werner Kolh\\\"orster coupled the coincidence\ntechnique with the new Geiger-M\\\"uller counter to study cosmic rays, marking\nthe start of cosmic-ray research as a branch of physics. The coincidence method\nwas further refined by Bruno Rossi, who developed a vacuum-tube device capable\nof registering the simultaneous occurrence of electrical pulses from any number\nof counters with a tenfold improvement in time resolution. The electronic\ncoincidence circuit bearing Rossi's name was instrumental in his research on\nthe corpuscular nature and the properties of cosmic radiation during the early\n1930s, a period characterized by a lively debate between Millikan and followers\nof the corpuscular interpretation. The Rossi coincidence circuit was also at\nthe core of the counter-controlled cloud chamber developed by Patrick Blackett\nand Giuseppe Occhialini, and became one of the important ingredients of\nparticle and nuclear physics.

In this work published posthumously in 1634 by his son\nLudwig, Kepler intends to defend the Copernican doctrine by detailing the\nperception of the world for an observer located on the Moon. Although Kepler\nwas not the first to write the fantastic account of a voyage from the Earth to\nthe Moon and \"pass around a message\", we show here that his \"Dream\" is made\nconspicuous under many aspects. Firstly, his author is one of the most\nremarkable minds of the history of sciences. Secondly, the \"Dream\" constitutes\nthe missing link between the texts of pure imagination by Lucian of Samosata\n(IInd c. AD), and the fantasy novels based on scientific discoveries by Jules\nVerne, at the end of XIXth century. In the third place, the complete text\npresents an extraordinary structure in encased accounts, built on several\nseries of explanatory notes drafted with the passing of years, as new astronomy\nprogressed. Also it should be retained the dramatic role that its diffusion,\nalthough confidential during Kepler's lifetime, had on his own personal and\nfamily life, as well as the major influence this book exerted on a whole\ncurrent of speculative literature devoted to space travel.\n",

The discovery of voids altered the accepted view\nof the large scale structure of the universe. In the old picture, the universe\nwas filled with field galaxies, and occasional density enhancements could be\nfound at the locations of rich galaxy clusters or superclusters. In the new\npicture, voids are interspersed between complex filamentary supercluster\nstructure that forms the so-called cosmic web.

The initial\nimpact of the 1978 discovery of voids was stunted for several years by\ntheoretical cosmologists in the West who were not quite sure how filaments and\nvoids could emerge from what otherwise appeared to be a homogeneous universe.\nAfter it became clear several years later that theoretical models of structure\nformation could explain the phenomenon, the new void and supercluster paradigm\nbecame widely accepted.\n",

This not trivial result has important\nimplications in the framework of the so-called Orion Correlation Theory, a\ncontroversial theory proposed by Bauval and Gilbert (1994), according to which\na perfect coincidence would exist between the disposition of the three stars of\nthe Orion Belt and that of the main Giza pyramids, so that the latter would\nrepresent the monumental reproduction on the ground of that important asterism.\n  ----\n  Nel presente lavoro viene determinato lo stato evolutivo delle stelle della\nCintura di Orione, ricavando che, all'epoca della costruzione delle piramidi,\nla luminosita' delle tre stelle della Cintura era di fatto uguale a quella\nodierna.

This\nhistorical meeting was mainly devoted to \"The Theory of Radiation and the\nQuanta\", at a time when the foundations of physics were totally shaken.\nAlthough \"nothing positive came out\" (Einstein), it is interesting to see the\ndiverging attitudes of Europe's most famous scientists in the middle of the\nquantum revolution. After a few general remarks about the conference, I shall\nfocus on some of the most interesting contributions and discussions. Einstein,\nat 32 the youngest, was clearly most aware of the profound nature of the\ncrises. He gave the final talk entitled \"The Present State of the Problem of\nSpecific Heats\", but he put his theme into the larger context of the quantum\nproblem, and caused a barrage of challenges, in particular from Lorentz,\nPlanck, Poincar\\'{e}, and others.\n",

The general account of\nhow to use quantum states and probabilities to explain otherwise puzzling\nregularities is then illustrated by showing how we can explain single particle\ninterference phenomena, the stability of matter, and interference of\nBose-Einstein condensates.

He considered himself a morphologist, and was preoccupied throughout\nhis career with matters of classification. Though his early life was difficult,\nand his pursuit of astronomy as a career was opposed by his father, he took a\nposition at Yerkes Observatory in 1926 and remained there for the rest of his\nworking life. Thematically, his work was also a unified whole. Beginning with\nspectroscopic studies under Otto Struve at Yerkes Observatory, by the late\n1930s he concentrated particularly on the young O and B stars. His work on\nstellar classification led to the Morgan-Keenan- Kellman [MKK] system of\nclassification of stars, and later - as he grappled with the question of the\nintrinsic color and brightness of stars at great distances - to the\nJohnson-Morgan UBV system for measuring stellar colors. Eventually these\nconcerns with classification and method led to his greatest single achievement\n- the recognition of the nearby spiral arms of our Galaxy by tracing the OB\nassociations and HII regions that outline them. After years of intensive work\non the problem of galactic structure, the discovery came in a blinding flash of\nArchimedean insight as he walked under the night sky between his office and his\nhouse in the autumn of 1951. His optical discovery of the spiral arms preceded\nthe radio-mapping of the spiral arms by more than a year. Morgan suffered a\nnervous breakdown soon after he announced his discovery, however, and so was\nprevented from publishing a complete account of his work. As a result of that,\nand the announcement soon afterward of the first radio maps of the spiral arms,\nthe uniqueness of his achievement was not fully appreciated at the time.\n",

The most important of the alternative models, the steady-state\ncosmology proposed in 1948, was uniformly expanding rather than exhibiting a\ncyclical behaviour.

A powerful\nheuristic today is the concept of a black hole, which is a robust and stable\ncomponent of many astronomical systems. During the 1930s relativists could only\noffer the \"Schwarzschild singularity\". I argue that the change occurred at\nleast partly because key theoretical physicists schooled in quantum theory\nentered relativity research and began to approach problematic issues by asking\nquestions about observable effects and the outcomes of thought experiments. The\nresult was the development of a physical intuition about such things as black\nholes, which could then be communicated to non-specialists.

Recently we proposed the linguistic\nquantum interpretation (called quantum and classical measurement theory), which\nwas characterized as a kind of metaphysical and linguistic turn of the\nCopenhagen interpretation. This turn from physics to language does not only\nextend quantum theory to classical systems but also yield the quantum\nmechanical world view (i.e., the philosophy of quantum mechanics, in other\nwords, quantum philosophy). In fact, we can consider that traditional\nphilosophies have progressed toward quantum philosophy. In this paper, we first\nreview the linguistic quantum interpretation, and further, clarify the relation\nbetween EPR-paradox and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

This is especially clear for relativistic systems, implying it's\nalso true of non-relativistic systems. Particles are epiphenomena arising from\nfields. Thus the Schroedinger field is a space-filling physical field whose\nvalue at any spatial point is the probability amplitude for an interaction to\noccur at that point. The field for an electron is the electron; each electron\nextends over both slits in the 2-slit experiment and spreads over the entire\npattern; and quantum physics is about interactions of microscopic systems with\nthe macroscopic world rather than just about measurements. It's important to\nclarify this issue because textbooks still teach a particles- and\nmeasurement-oriented interpretation that contributes to bewilderment among\nstudents and pseudoscience among the public.

As an alternative\nthat avoids the mathematical difficulties facing the approach of Jordan and\nPaul A. M. Dirac (1927), John von Neumann (1927a) developed the modern Hilbert\nspace formalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we focus on Jordan and von\nNeumann. Central to the formalisms of both are expressions for conditional\nprobabilities of finding some value for one quantity given the value of\nanother. Beyond that Jordan and von Neumann had very different views about the\nappropriate formulation of problems in quantum mechanics. For Jordan, unable to\nlet go of the analogy to classical mechanics, the solution of such problems\nrequired the identication of sets of canonically conjugate variables, i.e., p's\nand q's. For von Neumann, not constrained by the analogy to classical\nmechanics, it required only the identication of a maximal set of commuting\noperators with simultaneous eigenstates. He had no need for p's and q's. Jordan\nand von Neumann also stated the characteristic new rules for probabilities in\nquantum mechanics somewhat differently. Jordan (1927b) was the first to state\nthose rules in full generality. Von Neumann (1927a) rephrased them and, in a\nsubsequent paper (von Neumann, 1927b), sought to derive them from more basic\nconsiderations. In this paper we reconstruct the central arguments of these\n1927 papers by Jordan and von Neumann and of a paper on Jordan's approach by\nHilbert, von Neumann, and Nordheim (1928). We highlight those elements in these\npapers that bring out the gradual loosening of the ties between the new quantum\nformalism and classical mechanics.\n",

        "summary": "  In his 1948 lecture to the British Interplanetary Society, Olaf Stapledon\nconsidered the ultimate purpose of colonising other worlds. Having examined the\npossible motivations arising from improved scientific knowledge and access to\nextraterrestrial raw materials, he concludes that the ultimate benefits of\nspace colonisation will be the increased opportunities for developing human\n(and post-human) diversity, intellectual and aesthetic potential and,\nespecially, 'spirituality'. By the latter concept he meant a striving for\n\"sensitive and intelligent awareness of things in the universe (including\npersons), and of the universe as a whole.\" A key insight articulated by\nStapledon in this lecture was that this should be the aspiration of all human\ndevelopment anyway, with or without space colonisation, but that the latter\nwould greatly increase the scope for such developments. Another key aspect of\nhis vision was the development of a diverse, but connected, 'Commonwealth of\nWorlds' extending throughout the Solar System, and eventually beyond, within\nwhich human potential would be maximised. In this paper I analyse Stapledon's\nvision of space colonisation, and will conclude that his overall conclusions\nremain sound. However, I will also argue that he was overly utopian in\nbelieving that human social and political unity are prerequisites for space\nexploration (while agreeing that they are desirable objectives in their own\nright), and that he unnecessarily downplayed the more prosaic scientific and\neconomic motivations which are likely to be key drivers for space exploration\n(if not colonisation) in the shorter term. Finally, I draw attention to some\nrecent developments in international space policy which, although probably not\ninfluenced by Stapledon's work, are nevertheless congruent with his overarching\nphilosophy as outlined in 'Interplanetary Man?'\n",

        "summary": "  Mach's principle fits into the wider \"relational principle\", advocating that\nnot only inertia, but also space and time emerge from the interaction of\nmatter. Concepts of a Machian/relational theory are proposed, where inertia and\nenergy are defined as mutual properties between pairs of objects. Due to\nBerkeley, only radial motion represents kinetic energy between (point) masses,\nwhich is the basis of anisotropic inertia, which in turn underlies the\nrelational principle. The Newtonian definition of potential energy is\nconsidered a model for Machian inertia, leading to a frame independent\ndefinition of Machian kinetic energy, which comprises of the Newtonian terms\n(relative to the \"fixed stars\") and small anisotropic Machian energy terms\nbetween objects. The latter account for relativistic trajectories, such as the\nanomalous perihelion precession and Lense-Thirring frame dragging. However,\nrelativistic effects of remote observation (e.g. time dilation) demand an\nisotropic model. A relational spacetime metric is derived, which provides an\nisotropic coordinate transform of the anisotropic Machian model, yielding a\nrelational model which matches GR expressions for relativistic trajectories and\neffects of remote observation. Therefore, the experimental verification of GR\nin these cases holds automatically for the relational model. The relational\nmodel fits the relational principle (including Mach's principle) and it is\nargued that it includes GR as a special case. The relational metric provides\nboth contraction and (unbound) expansion as a function of relative potential,\ni.e. without invoking dark energy.\n",

The simplifications that can happen in this limit, and that we will\nconsider, are: (i) the theory's Feynman diagrams can be drawn on a plane\nwithout lines intersecting (called `planarity'); and (ii) the theory, or a\nsector of it, becomes integrable, and indeed corresponds to a well-studied\nsystem, viz. a spin chain. Planarity is important because it shows how a\nquantum field theory can exhibit extended, in particular string-like,\nstructures; in some cases, this gives a connection with string theory, and thus\nwith gravity.\n  Previous philosophical literature about how one theory (or a sector, or\nregime, of a theory) might be emergent from, and-or reduced to, another one has\ntended to emphasize cases, such as occur in statistical mechanics, where the\nsystem before the limit has finitely many degrees of freedom. But here, our\nquantum field theories, including those on the way to the 't Hooft limit, will\nhave infinitely many degrees of freedom.\n  Nevertheless, we will show how a recent schema by Butterfield and taxonomy by\nNorton apply to the quantum field theories we consider; and we will classify\nthree physical properties of our theories in these terms. These properties are\nplanarity and integrability, as in (i) and (ii) above; and the behaviour of the\nbeta-function reflecting, for example, asymptotic freedom.\n  Our discussion of these properties, especially the beta-function, will also\nrelate to recent philosophical debate about the propriety of assessing quantum\nfield theories, whose rigorous existence is not yet proven.\n",

According to recollections of Rosenfeld (1974, Proc. 16th Solvay\nConference on Physics, p. 174), Landau improvised the concept of neutron stars\nin a discussion with Bohr and Rosenfeld just after the news of the discovery of\nthe neutron reached Copenhagen in February 1932. We present arguments that the\ndiscussion took place in March 1931, before the discovery of the neutron, and\nthat they in fact discussed the paper written by Landau in Zurich in February\n1931 but not published until February 1932 (Phys. Z. Sowjetunion, 1, 285). In\nhis paper Landau mentioned the possible existence of dense stars which look\nlike one giant nucleus; this can be regarded as an early theoretical prediction\nor anticipation of neutron stars, prior to the discovery of the neutron. The\ncoincidence of the dates of the neutron's discovery and the paper's publication\nhas led to an erroneous association of the paper with the discovery of the\nneutron.

The method is shown on two octaves, starting from a\nfistula of length L=16 units and radius 1 which is equivalent at a monochord of\nlength {\\lambda}=18. The adopted acoustic correction for the first octave to\nthe Pythagorean lengths is L={\\lambda}-{\\alpha}r with {\\alpha}=2. The lower\noctave starts from L=36-2=34 units. The proportion 16:34=34:x is used for\nobtaining the next diapason. All lengths of the notes of this second octave\nfollow this proportion and no more the additional acoustic correction. Gerbert\nfinds the same multiplicative law for computing pipes and monochord's lengths,\nopportune constants allow to switch from monochord (12) to lower organ octave\n(14+1/3+1/144+1/288) to the higher one (13 + 1/2). The purpose of this treatise\nis to show the same mathematical order, given by God, below different\nacoustical phenomena. This is a modern perspective in history of science,\nbecause experimental data (practical acoustical corrections) are also taken\ninto account.

This was made to align a sphere equipped with tubes to observe\nthe celestial pole, the polar circles, the solstices and equinoxes. The use of\ntubes in astronomical observation is later reported by Alhazen in his treatise\non optics (1011-1021). The description of pointing to the celestial pole\nindicates that the instrument must be accurately aligned with the true pole,\nmaterialized at that epoch by a star of fifth magnitude, at the limit of naked\neye visibility, and then the instrument must remain fixed. Solstices and\nEquinoxes are points of the orbit of the Sun, so the sphere could be used as a\ntool for observing the Sun and probably determine the duration of the tropical\nyear. This sphere was much more than a didactic tool, given the long procedure\nfor the accurate alignement. Moreover \"Rogatus a pluribus\" (asked by his many\nstudents), Gerbert wrote a treatise on acoustic tubes (fistulae) in 980:\nMensura Fistularum. He knew the difference in behavior of the fistulae compared\nwith the acoustic strings, already studied by the Pythagoreans, and the treaty\nis intended to present the law that governs the length of the organ pipes in\ntwo octaves, compared to the corresponding acoustic strings. In terms of modern\nphysics we know that acoustic tubes require an \"end correction\" to be tuned,\nwhich is proportional to the diameter of the tube. This proportionality is the\nsame for every note. The mathematical law is simple, but Gerbert preferred to\ncreate a law in which the proportions of pipes and strings should be calculated\nthrough a series of fractions linked to the number 12 and its multiples.\n",

Part I\nof the present study deals with the epistula as a literary work (genre,\nlanguage, sources), dealing in turn with vocabulary, morphology and syntax,\nrythmical prose and rhetorical figures, literary and Biblical references. If we\ncompare it with D\\'ungal's other works, the letter is cast in the canonical\noratio structure similar to his later Responsa contra Claudium (ed. Zanna,\nFirenze 2002) and it is likewise based on lengthy quotations drawns from\nMacrobius' commentary In Somnium Scipionis. A possible echo of Vitruvius'\nastronomical presentation in book IX of his De architectura is suggested.\nFinally, we attempt to define how the author's persona as famulus et orator and\nreclusus at St-Denis relates to Charlemagne and to abbot Waldo in his pursuit\nof Chirstian wisdom based on the Bible rahter than of scholarship per se based\non academic research. Part II is a thorough technical discussion of the\nastronomical issue presented to the Irish scholar by the Emperor, i.e. The\nfrequency of solar eclipses and their visibility in the two emispheres in the\nyear 810 (see maps provided). It assesses D\\'ungal's case in terms of eclipse\ntheory and reviews previous comments on his letter to Charlemagne by astronomer\nIsmael Bullialdus (1605-1694). It also introduces us to first-hand knowledge of\neclipses in history and nowadays, providing a glimpse into the complex problems\ntackled by the Irishman and his sources in Late Antique and in the Early Middle\nAges. Ample footnotes to the Italian translation of D\\'ungal's work are an\nessential guiding tool for Latinists unfamiliar with astronomy.\n",

When outer space\nbecame a reality, he did not hesitate to leap into this new scientific\ndimension. Rossi's intuition on the importance of exploiting new technological\nwindows to look at the universe with new eyes, is a fundamental key to\nunderstand the profound unity which guided his scientific research path up to\nits culminating moments at the beginning of 1960s, when his group at MIT\nperformed the first in situ measurements of the density, speed and direction of\nthe solar wind at the boundary of Earth's magnetosphere, and when he promoted\nthe search for extra-solar sources of X rays. A visionary idea which eventually\nled to the breakthrough experiment which discovered Scorpius X-1 in 1962, and\ninaugurated X-ray astronomy.\n",

Now,\nmodal terminology is insufficient. Both times, extreme reactions reach from\nrejection of the empirical science to mystic holism. This paper shows how\nprogress started with the relativization of previously absolute terms, first\nthrough Einstein's relativity and now through Everett's relative state\ndescription, which is a modal realism. The historical parallels suggest mere\nrelativization is insufficient. A deformation of domains occurs: The determined\npast and the dependent future were restricted to smaller regions of space-time.\nThis light cone description is superior to hyperspace foliations and already\nentails the modal realism of quantum mechanics. Moreover, an entirely new\nregion, namely the \"absolute elsewhere\" was identified. The historical\nprecedent suggests that modal terminology may need a similar extension.\nDiscussing the modal realistic connection underlying both relativities,\nPopper's proof of future indeterminism is turned to shatter the past already\ninto many worlds/minds, thus Everett relativity is merely the Bell inequality\nviolating correlation between possible empirical records.\n",

It is possible to avoid this conflict using the ancient Chinese\nphilosophy of Taoism where two different views can co-exist in harmony. This is\nnot enough to explain Einstein's discovery of the mass-energy relation. The\nenergy-momentum relations for slow and ultra-fast particles take different\nforms. Einstein was able to synthesize these two formulas to create his\nenergy-mass relation. Indeed, this is what Hegelianism is about in physics.\nIsaac Newton synthesized open orbits for comets and closed orbits for planets\nto create his second law of motion. Maxwell combined electricity and magnetism\nto create his four equations to the present-day wireless world. In order to\nsynthesize wave and particle views of matter, Heisenberg formulated his\nuncertainty principle.

From a modern perspective, it\ncould seem surprising that the expansion of the universe was not announced at\nthis point. Examination of Slipher's papers shows that he reached a more subtle\nconclusion: the identification of cosmological peculiar velocities, including\nthe bulk motion of the Milky Way, leading to a beautiful argument in favour of\nnebulae as distant stellar systems. Nevertheless, Slipher's data actually\ncontain evidence at >8sigma for a positive mean velocity, even after\nsubtracting the dipole owing to the motion of the observer. In 1929, Hubble\nestimated distances for a sample of no greater depth, using redshifts due\nalmost entirely to Slipher. Hubble's distances were flawed in two distinct\nways: in addition to an incorrect absolute calibration, the largest distances\nwere systematically under-estimated. Nevertheless, he claimed the detection of\na linear distance-redshift relation. Statistically, the evidence for such a\ncorrelation is less strong than the simple evidence for a positive mean\nvelocity in Hubble's sample. Comparison with modern data shows that a sample of\nmore than twice Hubble's depth would generally be required in order to reveal\nclearly the global linear expansion in the face of the 'noise' from peculiar\nvelocities. When the theoretical context of the time is examined, the role of\nthe de Sitter model and its prediction of a linear distance-redshift relation\nlooms large. A number of searches for this relation were performed prior to\nHubble over the period 1924-1928, with a similar degree of success. All were\nbased on the velocities measured by Slipher, whose work from a Century ago\nstands out both for the precision of his measurements and for the subtle\nclarity of the arguments he employed to draw correct conclusions from them.\n",

In 1913 Henry Norris Russell could demonstrate the effect far\nmore strikingly because he measured the parallaxes of many stars at Cambridge,\nand could plot absolute magnitude against spectral type for many points. The\ngeneral concept of dwarf and giant stars was essential in the galactic\nstructure work of Harlow Shapley, Russell's first graduate student. In order to\ncalibrate the period-luminosity relation of Cepheid variables, he was obliged\nto fall back on statistical parallax using only 11 Cepheids, a very sparse\nsample. Here the insight provided by the Russell diagram became critical. The\npresence of yellow K giant stars in globular clusters credentialed his\ncalibration of the period-luminosity relation by showing that the calibrated\nluminosity of the Cepheids was comparable to the luminosity of the K giants. It\nis well known that in 1920 Shapley did not believe in the cosmological\ndistances of Heber Curtis' spiral nebulae. It is not so well known that in 1920\nCurtis' plot of the period-luminosity relation suggests that he didn't believe\nit was a physical relation and also he failed to appreciate the significance of\nthe Russell diagram for understanding the large size of the Milky Way.\n",

        "summary": "  Ninety years ago, in 1922, Alexander Friedman (1888-1925) demonstrated for\nthe first time that the General Relativity equations admit non-static solutions\nand thus the Universe may expand, contract, collapse, and even be born. The\nfundamental equations he derived still provide the basis for the current\ncosmological theories of the Big Bang and the Accelerating Universe. Later, in\n1924, he was the first to realize that General Relativity allows the Universe\nto be infinite. Friedman's ideas initially met strong resistance from Einstein,\nyet from 1931 he became their staunchest supporter. This essay connects\nFriedman's cosmological ideas with the 1998-2004 results of the astronomical\nobservations that led to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. It also describes\nFriedman's little known topological ideas of how to check General Relativity in\npractice and compares his contributions to those of Georges Lemaitre. Recently\ndiscovered corpus of Friedman's writings in the Ehrenfest Archives at Leiden\nUniversity sheds some new light on the circumstances surrounding his 1922 work\nand his relations with Paul Ehrenfest.\n",

We remain in\nwhat I will call the `Newtonian Paradigm' in all of physics, including Newton,\nEinstein, and Schrodinger. As I will show shortly, Newton invented and\nbequeathed to us `efficient cause entailing laws' for the entire becoming of\nthe universe. With Laplace this became the foundation of contemporary\nreductionism in which all that can happen in the world is due to efficient\ncause entailing laws. More this framework stands as our dominant way to do\nscience. The Newtonian Paradigm has done enormous work in science, and helped\nlead to the Industrial Revolution, and even our entry into Modernity.\n  In this paper I propose to challenge the adequacy of the Newtonian Paradigm\non two ground: 1) For the evolution of the biosphere beyond the watershed of\nlife, we can formulate no efficient cause entailing laws that allow us to\ndeduce the evolution of the biosphere. A fortiori, the same holds for the\nevolution of the economy, legal systems, social systems, and culture. Because I\nhave discussed this before with my colleagues Longo and Montevil (1,2) and\nelsewhere, (3,4), my discussion of this first point will be rather brief. 2)\nWhat I shall choose to call, after Aristotle's four causes, noted below, Formal\nCause Laws derived from specific `ensemble theories' tell us about the world.\nBut Formal Cause Laws are not reducible to efficient cause entailing laws of\nthe Newtonian Paradigm and, critically, have already, unnoticed, crept into\nbiology concerning the origin of life, and economics concerning economic\ngrowth. Formal cause laws appear to be a new way to do science, independent of\nefficient cause entailing laws. Thus Formal Cause laws can be independent of\nany specific material substrate. This may bear on the sufficiency of\nMaterialism in our account of the world.\n",

        "summary": "  The aim of this dissertation is to clarify the debate over the explanation of\nquantum speedup and to submit a tentative resolution to it. In particular, I\nargue that the physical explanation for quantum speedup is precisely the fact\nthat the phenomenon of quantum entanglement enables a quantum computer to fully\nexploit the representational capacity of Hilbert space. This is impossible for\nclassical systems, joint states of which must always be representable as\nproduct states.\n  Chapter 2 begins with a discussion of the most popular of the candidate\nphysical explanations for quantum speedup: the many worlds explanation. I argue\nthat unlike the neo-Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics it does not\nhave the conceptual resources required to overcome the `preferred basis\nobjection'. I further argue that the many worlds explanation, at best, can\nserve as a good description of the physical process which takes place in\nso-called network-based computation, but that it is incompatible with other\nmodels of computation such as cluster state quantum computing. I next consider,\nin Chapter 3, a common component of most other candidate explanations of\nquantum speedup: quantum entanglement. I investigate whether entanglement can\nbe said to be a necessary component of any explanation for quantum speedup, and\nI consider two major purported counter-examples to this claim. I argue that\nneither of these, in fact, show that entanglement is unnecessary for speedup,\nand that, on the contrary, we should conclude that it is. In Chapters 4 and 5 I\nthen ask whether entanglement can be said to be sufficient as well. In Chapter\n4 I argue that despite a result that seems to indicate the contrary,\nentanglement, considered as a resource, can be seen as sufficient to enable\nquantum speedup. Finally, in Chapter 5 I argue that entanglement is sufficient\nto explain quantum speedup as well.\n",

Following the 1962\noccultations of the strong radio source 3C 273 at Parkes, and the subsequent\nidentification with an apparent stellar object, Maarten Schmidt recognized that\nthe relatively simple hydrogen line Balmer series spectrum implied a redshift\nof 0.16 Successive radio and optical measurements quickly led to the\nidentification of other quasars with increasingly large redshifts and the\ngeneral, although for some decades not universal, acceptance of quasars as\nbeing by far the most distant and the most luminous objects in the Universe.\nCuriously, 3C 273, which is one of the strongest extragalactic sources in the\nsky, was first cataloged in 1959 and the magnitude 13 optical counterpart was\nobserved at least as early as 1887. Since 1960, much fainter optical\ncounterparts were being routinely identified using accurate radio\ninterferometer positions, measured primarily at the Caltech Owens Valley Radio\nObservatory. However, 3C 273 eluded identification until the series of lunar\noccultation observations led by Cyril Hazard, although inexplicably there was\nan earlier mis-identification with a faint galaxy located about an arc minute\naway from the true position. Ironically, due to calculation error, the\noccultation position used by Schmidt to determine the redshift of 3C 273 was in\nerror by 14 arcseconds, and a good occultation position was not derived until\nafter Schmidt had obtained his 200 inch spectrum.\n",

The career of Bruno Rossi, a leading personality in the study of cosmic\nrays and an Italian pioneer of this field of research, provides a prominent\nexample of this kind of international cooperation. Physics underwent major\nchanges during these turbulent years, and the traditional internationalism of\nphysics assumed a more institutionalised character. Against this backdrop,\nRossi's early work was crucial in transforming the study of cosmic rays into a\nbranch of modern physics. His friendly relationships with eminent scientists\n-notably Enrico Fermi, Walther Bothe, Werner Heisenberg, Hans Bethe, and Homi\nBhabha- were instrumental both for the exchange of knowledge about experimental\npractises and theoretical discussions, and for attracting the attention of\nphysicists such as Arthur Compton, Louis Leprince-Ringuet, Pierre Auger and\nPatrick Blackett to the problem of cosmic rays. Relying on material from\ndifferent archives in Europe and United States, this case study aims to provide\na glimpse of the intersection between national and international dimensions\nduring the 1930s, at a time when the study of cosmic rays was still very much\nin its infancy, strongly interlaced with nuclear physics, and full of\nuncertain, contradictory, and puzzling results.

With the aid of the platonic gnomonic factor (fgp) as we called\nit, we find that the oracles mentioned by Herodotus in his History, Dodona in\nGreece and Ammon in Oasis Siwa, Libya, were placed there because the noon\nshadow of Sun of a gnomon formed, back in 2500BC, the triangle of Plato the\nformer, and the Egyptian sacred triangle the latter. This means that both\nconcepts were known by Egyptians form Thebes long before they were formalized\nby the Greeks. The right angled triangle concept is an idealization, as said by\nD. Magdolen, of an astronomical observation; i. e. it is the shadow cast by a\ngnomon.\n  -----\n  Se presenta una modificacion al factor gnomonico usando el concepto de\ntriangulo de Platon.

Even if some authors have flatly\ndenied the possibility of such a prediction, others have struggled to find\ncycles which would justify the achievement of the philosopher. Some of the\nproposed cycles have already been refuted, but two of them, namely those of\nWilly Hartner and Dirk Couprie, remain unchallenged. This paper presents some\nimportant objections to these two possibilities, based on the fact that these\nauthors do not list all the eclipses potentially visible by their criteria. In\naddition, any explanation based on cycles will need to face the complex problem\nof visibility (smallest observable eclipse, weather...). The present article\nalso includes a statistical study on the predictability of solar eclipses for a\nvariety of periods, similar to that performed by Willy Hartner for lunar\neclipses, resulting in lower probabilities in the solar case (and percentages\ndepend on the chosen magnitude limit). The conclusion is that none of the\ncycles proposed so far provides a satisfactory explanation of the prediction,\nand, on statistical grounds, none of the periods studied leads to a significant\nprobability of success with solar eclipse cycles.\n",

It is true that later developments in quantum theory provide\na way to avoid retrocausality, without violating time-symmetry; but this escape\nroute relies on the \"ontic\" conception of the wave function that Einstein\nrejected.

Most of the discussion has focused on theoretical issues with the\nconsequence that operational prescriptions, which are integral to experimental\nphysics, have been largely ignored. This has undoubtedly exacerbated attempts\nto find a solution to the \"measurement problem\". In this paper, we fully\nembrace the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics that obviates the need\nto entertain reduction of the state vector, one of the primary dilemmas of the\nmeasurement problem. The other major aspect of the measurement problem, the\nnecessity of describing measurements in terms of classical concepts, remains.\nHowever, we argue that the ultimate interface with experiments is described by\noperational prescriptions and not in terms of the concepts of classical theory.\nThe pedestrian approach presented here suggests that the measurement problem\nis, in some sense, ill-posed and might never be resolved. This state of affairs\nis, in part, the result of searching for a theoretical answer to what is\nfundamentally an experimental question. This point of view is tenable so long\nas one is willing to view physical theories as providing models of nature\nrather than complete descriptions of reality. Among other things, these\nconsiderations lead us to suggest that the Copenhagen interpretation's\ninsistence on the classicality of the measurement apparatus should be replaced\nby the requirement that a measurement, which is specified operationally, should\nsimply be of sufficient precision.\n",

Since some of the operations in this set generate\nentangled states, it is commonly concluded that entanglement is insufficient to\nenable quantum computers to outperform classical computers. I argue in this\npaper that this conclusion is misleading. First, the statement of the theorem\n(that the particular set of quantum operations in question can be simulated\nusing a classical computer) is, on reflection, already evident when we consider\nBell's and related inequalities in the context of a discussion of computational\nmachines. This, in turn, helps us to understand that the appropriate conclusion\nto draw from the Gottesman-Knill theorem is not that entanglement is\ninsufficient to enable a quantum performance advantage, but rather that if we\nlimit ourselves to the operations referred to in the Gottesman-Knill theorem,\nwe will not have used the resources provided by an entangled quantum system to\ntheir full potential.\n",

These were erected almost until the end\nof the Bronze Age (Burl 2000, 1993). Significantly, a series of astronomical\npatternings have been empirically verified for many Bronze Age monuments that\nwere erected between 1400-900 BC (Higginbottom et 14 al. 2013, 2003, 2001,\n2000). Further, two series of complex landscape patternings associated with the\nsame monuments and their orientations have been identified (Higginbottom et al.\n2013 & Higginbottom 'in preparation' - Bronze Age megalithic monuments on the\nisle of Mull). However, when and where these patterns were first associated\nwith standing-stone structures was unknown. Through innovative statistics and\nsoftware we show that visible astronomical-landscape variables found at Bronze\nAge sites on the inner isles and mainland of western Scotland were actually\nfirst established nearly two millennia earlier, with the erection of the first\n'great circles' in Britain: Callanish on the Isle of Lewis and Stenness on the\nIsle of Orkney. In particular, we introduce our new statistical test that\nenables the quantitative determination of astronomical connections of stone\ncircles. It is seen that, whilst different standing-stone monuments were\ncreated over time (Burl 2000, 1993; 22 Higginbottom et al. 2013; Sheridan &\nBrophy 2012) with a mixture of landscape variables (Higginbottom et al. 2013),\nthere are nevertheless highly relevant aspects that remained unchanged through\nthese years.

He postulates that the fundamental\ncoupling of light and matter gives rises to the material body of the entire\ncosmos. Expansion is arrested when matter reaches a minimum density and\nsubsequent emission of light from the outer region leads to compression and\nrarefaction of the inner bodily mass so as to create nine celestial spheres,\nwith an imperfect residual core. In this paper we reformulate the Latin\ndescription in terms of a modern mathematical model. The equations which\ndescribe the coupling of light and matter are solved numerically, subject to\ninitial conditions and critical criteria consistent with the text. Formation of\na universe with a non-infinite number of perfected spheres is extremely\nsensitive to the initial conditions, the intensity of the light and the\ntransparency of these spheres. In this \"medieval multiverse\", only a small\nrange of opacity and initial density profiles lead to a stable universe with\nnine perfected spheres. As in current cosmological thinking, the existence of\nGrosseteste's universe relies on a very special combination of fundamental\nparameters.\n",

For this purpose, we approach the question from three\nperspectives. Firstly, we look at the situation from the standard quantum\nangle, more specifically the de Broglie wavelength analysis of the behavior of\nmacroscopic entities, indicate how a problem with spin and identity arises, and\nillustrate how both play a fundamental role in well-established experimental\nquantum-macroscopical phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensates. Secondly,\nwe analyze how the question is influenced by our result in axiomatic quantum\ntheory, which proves that standard quantum theory is structurally incapable of\ndescribing separated entities. Thirdly, we put forward our new 'conceptual\nquantum interpretation', including a highly detailed reformulation of the\nquestion to confront the new insights and views that arise with the foregoing\nanalysis. At the end of the final section, a nuanced answer is given that can\nbe summarized as follows. The specific and very classical perception of human\nseeing -- light as a geometric theory -- and human touching -- only ruled by\nPauli's exclusion principle -- plays a role in our perception of macroscopic\nentities as ontologically stable entities in space. To ascertain quantum\nbehavior in such macroscopic entities, we will need measuring apparatuses\ncapable of its detection. Future experimental research will have to show if\nsharp quantum effects -- as they occur in smaller entities -- appear to be\nontological aspects of customary macroscopic entities.\n",

We\nexamine the account of the effect in the old quantum theory, which was hailed\nas a major success of that theory, from the point of view of wave mechanics.\nFirst, we show how the new quantum mechanics solves a fundamental problem one\nruns into in the old quantum theory with the Stark effect.

The allowed energy levels and hence the line splittings are independent\nof the coordinates used but the size and eccentricity of the orbits are not. In\nthe new quantum theory, this worrisome non-uniqueness of orbits turns into the\nperfectly innocuous non-uniqueness of bases in Hilbert space. Second, we review\nhow the so-called WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation method for\nsolving the Schr\\\"odinger equation reproduces the quantum conditions of the old\nquantum theory amended by some additional half-integer terms.

To recover the\nexperimentally found line splittings, one had to make some arbitrary\nassumptions in addition to the basic quantum conditions to rule out certain\norbits. The calculation of intensities of lines on the basis of Bohr's\ncorrespondence principle likewise required arbitrary additional assumptions.\nFinally, the actual orbits predicted by the old quantum theory depend on the\ncoordinates chosen to impose the quantum conditions. Both Sommerfeld and\nEpstein recognized this problem but offered no solution for it. All these\nproblems were solved in 1926 when Schr\\\"odinger and Epstein explained the Stark\neffect on the basis of the new wave mechanics. The calculations in the two\ntheories are similar. In particular, both the Schr\\\"odinger equation in the new\ntheory and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the old theory are separated in\nparabolic coordinates. The new quantum mechanics determines all allowed states\nand transitions without any additional assumptions. It also replaced the\nambiguous guidelines based on the correspondence principle for calculating\nintensities by the straightforward prescription that intensities are given by\nthe squares of the matrix elements of position, leading to results that agreed\nmuch better with the experimental data. Finally, the embarrassing\nnon-uniqueness of orbits in the old quantum theory turned into the innocuous\nnon-uniqueness of bases of eigenfunctions in wave mechanics. To this day, the\nStark effect is remembered as one of the few qualified successes of the old\nquantum theory. We suspect that this is largely because after 1926 it became\njust one of the many unqualified successes of the new quantum theory.\n",

In\nthis essay, I will honour Istv\\'an's seventieth birthday, as well as his\nlongstanding interest in, and his seminal contributions to, this field going\nback to as early as 1987 by modestly proposing how the concrete implementation\nin N\\'emeti and D\\'avid (2006) might be complemented by a\nquantum-information-theoretic communication protocol between the computing\ndevice and the logician who sets the beyond-Turing computer a task such as\ndetermining the consistency of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.

So I confine myself to emphasizing how the\nmodern approach to renormalization (initiated by Wilson and others between 1965\nand 1975), when applied to quantum field theories, illustrates both Nagelian\nreduction and emergence. My main point is that the modern understanding of how\nrenormalizability is a generic feature of quantum field theories at accessible\nenergies gives us a conceptually unified family of Nagelian reductions.\n  That is worth saying since philosophers tend to think of scientific\nexplanation as only explaining an individual event, or perhaps a single law, or\nat most deducing one theory as a special case of another. Here we see a\nframework in which there is a space of theories endowed with enough structure\nthat it provides a family of reductions.\n",

Our\nmotivation is that renormalization is undoubtedly one of the great ideas, and\ngreat successes, of twentieth-century physics. Also it has strongly influenced\nin diverse ways, how physicists conceive of physical theories. So it is of\nconsiderable philosophical interest. Second, we will briefly relate\nrenormalization to Ernest Nagel's account of inter-theoretic relations,\nespecially reduction (Section 4).\n  One theme will be a contrast between two approaches to renormalization. The\nold approach, which prevailed from ca. 1945 to 1970, treated renormalizability\nas a necessary condition for being an acceptable quantum field theory. On this\napproach, it is a piece of great good fortune that high energy physicists can\nformulate renormalizable quantum field theories that are so empirically\nsuccessful. But the new approach to renormalization (from 1970 onwards)\nexplains why the phenomena we see, at the energies we can access in our\nparticle accelerators, are described by a renormalizable quantum field theory.\nFor whatever non-renormalizable interactions may occur at yet higher energies,\nthey are insignificant at accessible energies. Thus the new approach explains\nwhy our best fundamental theories have a feature, viz. renormalizability, which\nthe old approach treated as a selection principle for theories.\n  We also maintain that universality, a concept stressed in renormalization\ntheory, is essentially the familiar philosophical idea of multiple\nrealizability; and that it causes no problems for reductions of a Nagelian\nkind.\n",

        "summary": "  In 1893, the \"physicist-engineer\" Andr\\'e Blondel invents the oscilloscope\nfor displaying voltage and current variables. With this powerful means of\ninvestigation, he first studies the phenomena of the arc then used for the\ncoastal and urban lighting and then, the singing arc used as a transmitter of\nradio waves in wireless telegraphy. In 1905, he highlights a new type of\nnon-sinusoidal oscillations in the singing arc. Twenty years later, Balthasar\nvan der Pol will recognize that such oscillations were in fact \"relaxation\noscillations\". To explain this phenomenon, he uses a representation in the\nphase plane and shows that its evolution takes the form of small cycles. During\nWorld War I the triode gradually replaces the singing arc in transmission\nsystems. At the end of the war, using analogy, Blondel transposes to the triode\nmost of the results he had obtained for the singing arc. In April 1919, he\npublishes a long memoir in which he introduces the terminology \"self-sustained\noscillations\" and proposes to illustrate this concept starting from the example\nof the Tantalus cup which is then picked up by Van der Pol and Philippe Le\nCorbeiller. He then provides the definition of a self sustained system which is\nquite similar to that given later by Aleksandr Andronov and Van der Pol. To\nstudy the stability of oscillations sustained by the triode and by the singing\narc he uses, this time, a representation in the complex plane and he expresses\nthe amplitude in polar coordinates. He then justifies the maintaining of\noscillations by the existence cycles which nearly present all the features of\nPoincar\\'e's limit cycles. Finally, in November 1919, Blondel performs, a year\nbefore Van der Pol, the setting in equation of the triode oscillations. In\nMarch 1926, Blondel establishes the differential equation characterizing the\noscillations of the singing arc, completely similar to that obtained\nconcomitantly by Van der Pol for the triode. Thus, throughout his career,\nBlondel, has made fundamental and relatively unknown contributions to the\ndevelopment of the theory of nonlinear oscillations. The purpose of this\narticle is to analyze his main work in this area and to measure their\nimportance or influence by placing them in the perspective of the development\nof this theory.\n",

This paper examines astronomical heritage embodied in\nthe Barolo Palace in Buenos Aires. While references to Dante Alighieri and his\npoetry are scattered in streets, buildings and monuments around the Western\nworld, in the city of Buenos Aires, the only street carrying Dante's name is\nless than three blocks long and, appropriately, is a continuation of Virgilio\nstreet. A couple of Italian immigrants -a wealthy businessman, Luis Barolo, and\nan imaginative architect, Mario Palanti- foresaw this situation nearly a\ncentury ago, and did not save any efforts or money with the aim of getting\nDante and his cosmology an appropriate monumental recognition, in reinforced\nconcrete. The Barolo Palace is a unique combination of both astronomy and the\nworldview displayed in the Divine Comedy, Dante's poetic masterpiece. It is\nknown that the Palace's design was inspired by the great poet, but the details\nare not recorded; this paper relies on Dante's text to consider whether it may\nadd to our understanding of the building. Although the links of the Palace's\nmain architectural structure with the three realms of the Comedy have been\nstudied in the past, its unique astronomical flavor has not been sufficiently\nemphasized. The word of God, as interpreted by the Fathers of the Church in\nSacred Scripture, Aristotle's physics and Ptolemy's astronomy, all beautifully\nconverge in Dante's verses, and the Barolo Palace reflects this.\n",

This derived from the seminal\ndissertation work of Ralph A. Alpher. He was a doctoral student of George A.\nGamow and developed several critical advances in cosmology in late 1946, 1947,\nand 1948. Alpher developed the ideas of \"hot\" big bang cosmology to a high\ndegree of physical precision, and was the first to present the idea that\nradiation, not matter, predominated the early universal adiabatic expansion\nfirst suggested by A. Friedmann in the early 1920s. Alpher and Herman predicted\nthe residual relic black-body temperature in 1948 and 1949 at around 5 K.\nHowever, to this day, this prediction, and other seminal ideas in big bang\ncosmology, have often been attributed erroneously to the better-known George A.\nGamow. This article reviews some of the more egregious and even farcical errors\nin the scholarly literature about Ralph A. Alpher and his place in the history\nof big bang cosmology. Two such errors are that (a) Alpher was a fictive\nperson; or (b) that like the French mathematician Nicolas Bourbaki, Alpher was\na \"conglomerate\" of theoreticians.\n",

He discovered, along with one of his\nstudents, Georg Pfotzer, the altitude at which the production of ionisation in\nthe atmosphere reaches a maximum, often, but misleadingly, called the Pfotzer\nmaximum. Regener was one of the first to estimate the energy density of cosmic\nrays, an estimate that was used by Baade and Zwicky to bolster their postulate\nthat supernovae might be their source. Yet Regener's name is less recognised by\npresent-day cosmic ray physicists than it should be largely because in 1937 he\nwas forced to take early retirement by the National Socialists as his wife had\nJewish ancestors. In this paper we briefly review his work on cosmic rays and\nrecommend an alternative naming of the ionisation maximum. The influence that\nRegener had on the field through his son, his son-in-law, his grandsons and his\nstudents and through his links with Rutherford's group in Cambridge is\ndiscussed in an appendix. Regener was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics\nby Schroedinger in 1938. He died in 1955 at the age of 73.\n",

Despite this, we find that in many ways, the debate\nconcerning becoming parallels the well-rehearsed lines it follows in the domain\nof relativity. We present, however, some new twists and challenges. In\nparticular, we show that a novel and exotic notion of becoming is compatible\nwith causal sets. In contrast to the 'localized' becoming considered compatible\nwith the dynamics of causal set theory by its advocates, our novel kind of\nbecoming, while not answering to the typical A-theoretic demands, is 'global'\nand objective.\n",

Both of these interpretations are statistical. The\nfirst interpretation, by A.

The second, by A.\nKhrennikov, is ultimately realist, because it assumes that the\nquantum-mechanical level of reality is underlain by a deeper level of reality,\ndescribed, in a realist fashion, by a model, based on the pre-quantum classical\nstatistical field theory (PCSFT), the predictions of which reproduce those of\nquantum mechanics.

A\nhitherto largely overlooked disagreement between Bohr and Heisenberg about the\nmovability of the \"cut\" between measuring apparatus and observed quantum system\nsupports the view that, for Bohr, such a cut did not originate in dynamical\n(ontological) considerations, but rather in functional (epistemological)\nconsiderations. As such, both the motivation and the target of Bohr's doctrine\nof classical concepts are of a fundamentally different nature than what is\nunderstood as the dynamical problem of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our\nanalysis suggests that, contrary to claims often found in the literature,\nBohr's doctrine is not, and cannot be, at odds with proposed solutions to the\ndynamical problem of the quantum-classical transition that were pursued by\nseveral of Bohr's followers and culminated in the development of decoherence\ntheory.\n",

The article also confirms that\nEinstein did not believe that simplistic relativistic models could give an\naccurate description of the early universe.\n",

This paper discusses the contribution of Bruno to the principle of\nrelativity. According to common knowledge, the special principle of relativity\nwas first enunciated in 1632 by Galileo Galilei in his Dialogo sopra i due\nmassimi sistemi del mondo (Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems),\nusing the metaphor today known as \"Galileo's ship\": in a boat moving at\nconstant speed, the mechanical phenomena can be described by the same laws\nholding on Earth. We shall show that the same metaphor and some of the examples\nin Galilei's book were already contained in the dialogue La cena de le Ceneri\n(The Ash Wednesday Supper) published by Giordano Bruno in 1584. In fact,\nGiordano Bruno largely anticipated the arguments of Galilei on the relativity\nprinciple. It is likely that Galilei was aware of Bruno's work, and it is\npossible that the young Galilei discussed with Bruno, since they both stayed in\nVenezia for long periods in 1592.\n",

We also sketch the ideological background of those sightings and\nthere were many similar reports throughout that time. In addition, we present a\nsmall drawing of a lunar halo display with horizontal arc and vertical pillar\nforming a cross for shortly later, namely AD 806 June 4, the night of full\nmoon, also from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; we also show historic drawings of\nsolar and lunar halo crosses from G.

It thus\nexhibits the whole Minkowski space-time structure, indirectly for volumes.\nMassive scalar gravity is plausible as a field theory, but violates Einstein's\nprinciples of general covariance, general relativity, equivalence, and Mach.\nGeometry is a poor guide: matter sees a conformally flat metric due to\nuniversal coupling, but gravity sees the rest of the flat metric (on long\ndistances) in the mass term. What is the `true' geometry, in line with\nPoincar\\'e's modal conventionality argument? Infinitely many theories exhibit\nthis bimetric `geometry,' all with the total stress-energy's trace as source;\ngeometry does not explain the field equations. The irrelevance of the\nEhlers-Pirani-Schild construction to conventionalism is evident given\nmulti-geometry theories. As Seeliger envisaged, the smooth massless limit\nyields underdetermination between massless and massive scalar gravities---an\nunconceived alternative. One version easily could have been developed before\nGR; it would have motivated thinking of Einstein's equations along the lines of\nhis newly reappreciated \"physical strategy\" and suggested a rivalry from\nmassive spin 2 for GR (massless spin 2, Pauli-Fierz 1939). The\nPutnam-Gr\\\"unbaum debate on conventionality is revisited given a broad modal\nscope. Massive scalar gravity licenses a historically plausible rational\nreconstruction of much of space-time philosophy in light of particle physics.\nAn appendix reconsiders the Malament-Weatherall-Manchak conformal restriction\nof conventionality and constructs the `universal force' in the null cones.\n",

Two interpretational branch points are\nidentified and discussed. First, whether duals are physically equivalent or\nnot: by considering a duality of the familiar simple harmonic oscillator, I\nargue that they are. Unlike the oscillator, there are no measurements 'outside'\nstring theory that could distinguish the duals. Second, whether duals agree or\ndisagree on the radius of 'target space', the space in which strings evolve\naccording to string theory. I argue for the latter position, because the\nalternative leaves it unknown what the radius is. Since duals are physically\nequivalent yet disagree on the radius of target space, it follows that the\nradius is indeterminate between them. Using an analysis of Brandenberger and\nVafa (1989), I explain why -- even so -- space is observed to have a\ndeterminate, large radius. The conclusion is that observed, 'phenomenal' space\nis not target space, since a space cannot have both a determinate and\nindeterminate radius: instead phenomenal space must be a higher-level\nphenomenon, not fundamental.\n",

In\naddition to the old teleological question, this paper continues the recent\ndiscussion regarding the modal involvement of the principle of least action and\nits relations with the Humean view of the laws of nature. The reality of\npossible paths in the principle of least action is examined from the\nperspectives of the contemporary metaphysics of modality and Leibniz's concept\nof essences or possibles striving for existence. I elaborate a modal\ninterpretation of the principle of least action that replaces a classical\nrepresentation of a system's motion along a single history in the actual\nmodality by simultaneous motions along an infinite set of all possible\nhistories in the possible modality. This model is based on an intuition that\ndeep ontological connections exist between the possible paths in the principle\nof least action and possible quantum histories in the Feynman path integral. I\ninterpret the action as a physical measure of the essence of every possible\nhistory. Therefore only one actual history has the highest degree of the\nessence and minimal action. To address the issue of necessity, I assume that\nthe principle of least action has a general physical necessity and lies between\nthe laws of motion with a limited physical necessity and certain laws with a\nmetaphysical necessity.\n",

He approached\nthese questions with an open, agile and critical mind, something quickly\nevident to anyone who had the privilege of conversing with him. His choice of\nproblems to pursue, which for the most part involved epistemology and the\nrelationships between mind, matter and space-time, was visionary. Undoubtedly,\nmost of the discussions of Abner Shimony's work in future will center on his\nenormous contribution to the investigation of the significance to physics, both\ntheoretical and experimental, of quantum entanglement, the characteristic of\nphysical entities on which his work came to concentrate, well represented in\nthe Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt inequality. Also significant for physics is\nhis pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the\nearly-to-mid 1990s. Shimony focused largely on the question of the relationship\nbetween knowledge and the world, as he did not view these two philosophical\nconcerns as distinct from study of the implications of entanglement per se.\nIndeed, the most well known phrase he coined is \"experimental metaphysics.\" He\nis also known for the reapplication of the expression \"peaceful coexistence\" as\npertaining to the relationship between quantum mechanics and special\nrelativity. Shimony's less well known intellectual engagement was with the\nquestion of the relationship between mind and matter, which only a few\nphysicists of our time have engaged seriously, likely because of its more\nphilosophical and less mathematically tractable character. This appreciation\nreflects all these aspects of Abner Shimony's long and successful intellectual\ncareer, in addition to details of his education, including mention of some of\nhis teachers.\n",

Rather than attempting to define information ab initio, I introduce\nthe concept of interaction between material bodies as a primary concept. Two\ndistinct categories can be identified: 1) Interactions which can always be\nreduced to a superposition of physical interactions (forces) between elementary\nconstituents; 2) Interactions between complex bodies which cannot be reduced to\na superposition of interactions between parts, and in which patterns and forms\n(in space and/or time) play the determining role. Pragmatic information is then\ndefined as the correspondence between a given pattern and the ensuing\npattern-specific change. I will show that pragmatic information is a biological\nconcept that plays no active role in the purely physical domain; it only does\nso when a living organism intervenes. The consequences for the foundations of\nboth classical and quantum physics are important and will be discussed in\ndetail. Since by its very definition pragmatic information (the one our brain\nuses to represent, think about and react to the outside world)cannot operate in\nthe quantum domain, it is advisable to refrain from using it in our mental\nrepresentation of what is happening 'inside' a quantum system. Although the\ntheoretical framework developed for quantum mechanics handles mathematical\nentities specifically attributed to a quantum system, the only truly pragmatic\ninformation it can provide relates to macroscopic effects on the environment\n(natural, or artificial as in a measurement instrument) with which the system\ninteracts.\n",

Of\nthe twelve animals identified in the Ooldean sky, the nine stellar (i.e.\nnon-planet or non-galactic) associations were analysed and each demonstrated a\nclose connection between animal behaviour and stellar positions.

This idea seems to imply a kind of\n\"quantum fundamentalism\" according to which everything in the universe (if not\nthe universe as a whole) is fundamentally of a quantum nature and ultimately\ndescribable in quantum-mechanical terms. Bohr's conception of quantum mechanics\nhas traditionally been seen as opposed to such a view, not least because of his\ninsistence on the necessity of the concepts of classical physics in the account\nof quantum phenomena. Recently, however, a consensus seems to be emerging among\ncareful commentators on Bohr to the effect that he, after all, did subscribe to\nsome version of quantum fundamentalism. Against this consensus, and by\nre-examining the historical record, I will defend a variant of the traditional\nreading of Bohr in which (1) the answer to what an object is (quantum or\nclassical) depends on the experimental context; and (2) in principle, any\nphysical system can be treated quantum-mechanically but not all systems can be\ntreated that way at the same time.\n",

But there is little consensus\nconcerning his reasons, and what he exactly meant by this. In this paper, I\nre-examine Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics, and argue that the\nnecessity of the classical can be seen as part of his response to the\nmeasurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr's view on the\nclassical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories is\nthat of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists\nin distinguishing Bohr's idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a\npurely epistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence\nconcerning Bohr's conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his\ninterpretation apart from both standard versions of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation, and from some of the reconstructions of his view found in the\nliterature. I conclude with a few remarks on how Bohr's ideas make much sense\nalso when modern developments in quantum gravity and early universe cosmology\nare taken into account.\n",

I present a review of developments in this subject since 1915,\nthrough the broad range of new approaches that commenced in the late 1950s, and\nup to the transition of experimental gravity physics to what might be termed a\nnormal and accepted part of physical science in the late 1960s. This review\nshows the importance of advances in technology, here as in all branches of\nnatural science. The role of contingency is illustrated by Robert Dicke's\ndecision in the mid-1950s to change directions in mid-career, to lead a\nresearch group dedicated to the experimental study of gravity. The review also\nshows the power of nonempirical evidence. Some in the 1950s felt that general\nrelativity theory is so logically sound as to be scarcely worth the testing.\nBut Dicke and others argued that a poorly tested theory is only that, and that\nother nonempirical arguments, based on Mach's Principle and Dirac's Large\nNumbers hypothesis, suggested it would be worth looking for a better theory of\ngravity. I conclude by offering lessons from this history, some peculiar to the\nstudy of gravity physics during the naissance, some of more general relevance.\nThe central lesson, which is familiar but not always well advertised, is that\nphysical theories can be empirically established, sometimes with surprising\nresults.\n",

The case of the churches built in northwest\nAfrica before the arrival of Islam is paradigmatic in this regard, and may\nreflect earlier traditions. The Canary Islands is the western end of this North\nAfrican cultural koine, so we thought it would be relevant to study a compact\nset of old churches in one of the islands of the archipelago, choosing to start\nour project with Lanzarote. We have measured the orientation of a total of 30\nchurches built prior to 1810, as well as a few buildings of later times, nearly\na complete sample of all the island Christian sanctuaries. The analysis of this\nsample indicates that a definite orientation pattern was followed on the island\nbut, unlike the standard one often found in most of the Christian world, this\nprototype is twofold. On the one hand, the representative orientation to the\neast (or west) is present. However, the sample has also a marked orientation\ntowards the north-northeast, which is as far as we know a pattern exclusive of\nLanzarote. We analyze the reasons for this rule and suggest that one possible\nexplanation could be a rather prosaic one, namely, that sometimes earthly needs\nare more relevant than religious beliefs.\n",

We\ndiscuss in depth the nature of the paradox and show that the problematics it\npresents is first and foremost epistemological. After briefly exploring\nresolutions to the paradox that after many decades of discourse still remain\ncontroversial, we argue that the paradox is rooted in the failure of our\ncurrent metaphysical scheme, being the foundation of our knowledge, to\naccommodate and cohere our knowledge of the phenomena of entanglement. We then\ndevelop and make the case for a novel and more fundamental resolution of the\nparadox by changing the underlying metaphysical foundation from one based on\nindividuals to a one based on individuation. We discuss in detail how in the\nlight of this new scheme concepts central to the paradox such as realism,\ncausality and locality are adjusted to the effect that the paradox is resolved\nwithout giving up these concepts so fundamental to our thinking. We conclude\nwith a brief note about the important role of metaphysics to the progress of\nknowledge and our understanding of reality.\n",

In his formal analysis\nof EPR-type entangled quantum states, Bell (1964) concluded that any hidden\nvariable theory designed to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics must\nnecessarily be nonlocal and allow superluminal interactions. This doesn't\nimmediately imply that nonlocality is a characteristic feature of quantum\nmechanics let alone a fundamental property of nature; however, many physicists\nand philosophers of science do harbor this belief. Experts in the field often\nuse the term `nonlocality' to designate particular non-classical aspects of\nquantum entanglement and do not confuse the term with superluminal\ninteractions. However, many physicists seem to take the term more literally. I\nendeavor to disabuse the latter of this notion by emphasizing that the\ncorrelations of Bell-type entanglement are a result of ordinary quantum\nsuperposition with no need to introduce nonlocality. The conclusion of the EPR\npaper wasn't that quantum mechanics is nonlocal but rather that it is an\nincomplete description of reality.

        "summary": "  The recently published Yemeni observing report about SN 1006 from al-Yamani\nclearly gives AD 1006 Apr $17 \\pm 2$ (mid-Rajab 396h) as first observation\ndate. Since this is about 1.5 weeks earlier than the otherwise earliest reports\n(Apr 28 or 30) as discussed so far, we were motivated to investigate an early\nsighting in more depth. We searched for additional evidences from other areas\nlike East Asia and Europe. We found that the date given by al-Yamani is fully\nconsistent with other evidence, including: (a) SN 1006 \"rose several times half\nan hour after sunset\" (al-Yamani), which is correct for the location of Sana in\nYemen for the time around Apr 17, but it would not be correct for late Apr or\nearly May; (b) the date (3rd year, 3rd lunar month, 28th day wuzi, Ichidai\nYoki) for an observation of a guest star in Japan is inconsistent (there is no\nday wuzi in that lunar month), but may be dated to Apr 16 by reading wuwu date\nrather than a wuzi date; (c) there is observational evidence that SN 1006 was\nobserved in East Asia early or mid April; for the second half of April, a bad\nweather (early monsoon) period is not unlikely -- there is a lack of night\nreports; (d) the observer in St. Gallen reported to have seen SN 1006 \"for\nthree months\", which must have ended at the very latest on AD 1006 Jul 10,\ngiven his northern location, so that his observations probably started in\nApril. We conclude that the correctly reported details give quite high\nconfidence in the fully self-consistent report of al-Yamani, so that the early\ndiscovery date should be considered seriously.\n",

In this essay, I examine an ambitious 16th and 17th-century\nintellectual agenda from the perspective of Wigner's question, namely, what\nhistorian Paolo Rossi calls \"the quest to create a universal language.\" While\nmany elite thinkers pursued related ideas, the most inspiring and forceful was\nGottfried Leibniz's effort to create a \"universal calculus,\" a pictorial\nlanguage which would transparently represent the entirety of human knowledge,\nas well as an associated symbolic calculus with which to model the behavior of\nphysical systems and derive new truths. I suggest that a deeper understanding\nof why the efforts of Leibniz and others failed could shed light on Wigner's\noriginal question. I argue that the notion of reductionism is crucial to\ncharacterizing the failure of Leibniz's agenda, but that a decisive argument\nfor the why the promises of this effort did not materialize is still lacking.\n",

        "summary": "  The world runs on communicated sequences of symbols, e.g. numerals. Examining\nboth engineered and natural communications networks reveals an unsuspected\norder that depends on contact with an unpredictable entity. This order has\nthree roots. The first is a proof within quantum theory that no evidence can\never determine its explanation, so that an agent choosing an explanation must\ndo so unpredictably. The second root is the showing that clocks that step\ncomputers do not \"tell time\" but serve as self-adjusting symbol-handling agents\nthat regulate \"logically synchronized\" motion in response to unpredictable\ndisturbances. Such a clock-agent has a certain independence as well as the\ncapacity to communicate via unpredictable symbols with other clock-agents and\nto adjust its own tick rate in response to that communication. The third root\nis the noticing of unpredictable symbol exchange in natural systems, including\nthe transmission of symbols found in molecular biology. We introduce a\nsymbol-handling agent as a role played in some cases by a person, for example a\nphysicist who chooses an explanation of given experimental outcomes, and in\nother cases by some other biological entity, and in still other cases by an\ninanimate device, such as a computer-based detector used in physical\nmeasurements. While we forbear to try to explain the propensity of agents at\nall levels from cells to civilizations to form and operate networks of\nlogically synchronized symbol-handling agents, we point to this propensity as\nan overlooked cosmic order, an order structured by the unpredictability ensuing\nfrom the proof. Appreciating the cosmic order leads to a conception of agency\nthat replaces volition by unpredictability and re-conceives the notion of\nobjectivity in a way that makes a place for agency in the world as described by\nphysics. Some specific implications for physics are outlined.\n",

In the US they reacted\nto research cuts after the war in Vietnam, and were inspired by the New Age\nmood. In Italy the dissatisfaction of the young generations was rooted in the\nstudent protests of 1968 and the subsequent labour and social fights, which\nchallenged the role of scientists. The young generations of physicists searched\nfor new scientific approaches and challenged their own scientific knowledge and\nrole. The criticism to the FQM and the perspectives of submitting them to\nexperimental tests were perceived as an innovative research field and this\nattitude was directly linked to the search for an innovative and radical\napproach in the history of science. All these initiatives gave rise to booming\nactivity throughout the 1970s, contributing to influence the scientific\nattitude and the teaching approach.\n",

Like several other German physicists\nHeisenberg was drafted by German Army Ordnance when war began in Europe in\nSeptember 1939 to investigate whether the energy from splitting Uranium nuclei\nby neutrons could be used for technical and military purposes. Heisenberg found\nthat this is possible in principle but that military use would require such\nenormous industrial expenditures that it would take many years and would be\nimpracticable while the war lasted. The project was therefore dropped by the\nNazi government in 1942. Heisenberg even refrained from calculating a precise\nvalue for the critical mass of U 235. He was relieved that he was thus spared a\nmoral decision between obeying an order to build the bomb or risking his life\nby refusing to be involved in the project or sabotaging it. He was happy to be\nconfined to a project of building a small test reactor under civilian\nadministration that the government had approved. In 1941 Heisenberg tried to\nget the opinion of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen on what the international community\nof nuclear physicist could possibly do or prevent regarding the long-range\ntechnical feasibility of making nuclear weapons. Bohr completely misunderstood\nthe cautious approach of Heisenberg.\n",

Interestingly enough, a comet referred to as `heavenly tree' was\nseen in 162 BC, as reported by old Chinese records. Because of weak surface\ngravity, cometary appendages may possibly assume strange shapes depending on\nfactors like rotation, structure and composition of the comet as well as solar\nwind pattern. Varahamihira and Ballala Sena listed several comets having\nstrange forms as reported originally by ancient seers such as Parashara,\nVriddha Garga, Narada and Garga.\n  Mahabharata speaks of a mortal king Nahusha who ruled the heavens when Indra,\nking of gods, went into hiding. Nahusha became luminous and egoistic after\nabsorbing radiance from gods and seers. When he kicked Agastya (southern star\nCanopus), the latter cursed him to become a serpent and fall from the sky. We\nposit arguments to surmise that this Mahabharata lore is a mythical recounting\nof a cometary event wherein a comet crossed Ursa Major, moved southwards with\nan elongated tail in the direction of Canopus and eventually went out of sight.\nIn order to check whether such a conjecture is feasible, a preliminary list of\ncomets (that could have or did come close to Canopus) drawn from various\nhistorical records is presented and discussed.\n",

The aim of the schema is to give a more precise\ncriterion for duality than has so far been considered.\n  The bosonization example, or boson-fermion duality, has the feature of being\nsimple yet rich enough to illustrate the most relevant aspects of our schema,\nwhich also apply to more sophisticated dualities. The richness of the example\nconsists, mainly, in its concern with two non-trivial quantum field theories:\nincluding massive Thirring-sine-Gordon duality, and non-abelian bosonization.\n  This prompts two comparisons with the recent literature on dualities:---\n  (a) Unlike the standard cases of duality in quantum field theory and string\ntheory, where only specific simplifying limits of the theories are explicitly\nknown, the boson-fermion duality is known to hold exactly. This exactness can\nbe exhibited explicitly.\n  (b) The bosonization example illustrates both the cases of isomorphic and\nnon-isomorphic models: which we believe the literature on dualities has not so\nfar discussed.\n",

To date, however, it has not been sufficiently motivated to play such a\nfoundational role. The motivations that have so far been given are, as I argue,\neither unsatisfactorily vague or appeal to little if anything more than\nintuition. Thus in this paper I consider whether some way might be found to\nsuccessfully motivate the principle. And I propose that a compelling way of so\ndoing is to understand it as a generalisation of Einstein's principle of the\nmutually independent existence---the `being-thus'---of spatially distant\nthings. In particular I first describe an argument, due to Demopoulos, to the\neffect that the so-called `no-signalling' condition can be viewed as a\ngeneralisation of Einstein's principle that is appropriate for an irreducibly\nstatistical theory such as quantum mechanics. I then argue that a compelling\nway to motivate information causality is to in turn consider it as a further\ngeneralisation of the Einsteinian principle that is appropriate for a theory of\ncommunication. I describe, however, some important conceptual obstacles that\nmust yet be overcome if the project of establishing information causality as a\nfoundational principle of nature is to succeed.\n",

In the present paper, after an\nexamination of the limitations of Kuhn's response to his critics, I put forward\nthe idea, although it is not new, that these changes in Physics cannot be\nreduced to a point-like event, but happened instead through multiple successive\n(and even contradictory) changes in the course of decades. Such as the old\nquantum hypothesis, wave mechanics, orthodox quantum mechanics. In fact, the\ninnovative perspectives started in the 1980s have been considered as a third\nquantum revolution. My basic argument is that these changes, in order to be\nreally understood, must be interpreted not as mere specific changes in Physics,\nbut framed in the context of the deep social, cultural, and economic changes\nduring those turbulent years. The main steps are outlined.\n",

We describe how and why\nRosenfeld tried to face this problem in 1927, analysing the role of his\nmentors: Oskar Klein, Louis de Broglie and Th\\'eophile De Donder. Rosenfeld\nasked himself how quantum mechanics should \\textit{concretely} modify general\nrelativity. In the context of a five-dimensional theory, Rosenfeld tried to\nconstruct a unifying framework for the gravitational and electromagnetic\ninteraction and wave mechanics. Using a sort of \"general relativistic quantum\nmechanics\" Rosenfeld introduced a wave equation on a curved background. He\ninvestigated the metric created by what he called `quantum phenomena',\nrepresented by wave functions. Rosenfeld integrated Einstein equations in the\nweak field limit, with wave functions as source of the gravitational field. The\nauthor performed a sort of semi-classical approximation obtaining at the first\norder the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om metric. We analyse how Rosenfeld's work is part\nof the history of Quantum Mechanics, because in his investigation Rosenfeld was\nguided by Bohr's correspondence principle. Finally we briefly discuss how his\ncontribution is connected with the task of finding out which metric can be\ngenerated by a quantum field, a problem that quantum field theory on curved\nbackgrounds will start to address 35 years later.\n",

Worthwhile\ncoincidences among the principles of the Ficinian philosophy, the historical\ncharacters involved and the compositional elements of the painting, show how\nthe astronomical knowledge of that time strongly influenced this masterpiece.\nFirst, Astronomy provides its precise dating since the artist used the\nastronomical ephemerides of his time, albeit preserving a mythological meaning,\nand a clue for Botticelli's signature. Second, it allows the correlation among\nBotticelli's creative intention, the historical facts and the astronomical\nphenomena such as the heliacal rising of the planet Venus in conjunction with\nthe Aquarius constellation dating back to the earliest representations of Venus\nin Mesopotamian culture. This work not only bears a significant value for the\nhistory of science and art, but, in the current era of three-dimensional\nmapping of billion stars about to be delivered by Gaia, states the role of\nastronomical heritage in Western culture.

It is based on two ideas, the localization\nof mathematical systems in space or space time, and the separation of the\nconcepts of number from number value. The separation of number from number\nvalue along with the freedom of choice of number values at different points of\nspace or space time enables the introduction of a space or space time dependent\nnumber valuation field. The presence of a location dependent number value field\naffects theoretical descriptions of many physical and geometric quantities. A\nsimple geometric example is worked out in detail, that of the length of a path.\n  The localization of mathematical systems and the separation of number from\nnumber value or meaning both emphasize the role of observers. The separation of\nnumber from number value shows the role of observers in that value or meaning\nare conscious observer related concepts. Nothing, including numbers, has value\nor meaning to an unconscious observer. The localization of mathematical systems\nalso shows the role of observers in that the mathematics that is potentially\navailable to an observer is that at the same position as is the observer. This\nrepresents the mathematical knowledge that can reside in an observers brain. As\nan observer moves in space or space time, the mathematical knowledge\npotentially available to the observer is the collection of mathematical systems\nat the same location as the observer. It is hoped that this work, which was\nbegun in 2010, will lead to a better understanding of the relation between the\nfoundations of mathematics and physics, and the role that observers play in\nthis relation.\n",

Recently,\nit has become particularly relevant due to a proposed criterion of the physical\nreality of a given quantum mechanical observable [A. L. O. Bilobran and R. M.\nAngelo, Europhys. Lett. 112, 40005 (2015)]. We examine this proposal and its\nconsequently related measure of non-locality [V. S. Gomez and R. M. Angelo,\nPhys. Rev. A 97, 012123, (2018)] and argue that the criterion is ill-described\nas quantifying physical reality without introducing serious inconsistency with\nthe basic notions of realism that under-gird enquiry. We agree that this\nreality criterion demonstrates, along with the famous GHZ results, that general\nquantum observable values make for poor elements of reality. However, we also\nargue that this does not mean no such elements of reality are to be found in\nquantum theory. By arguing for, and adopting, probability distributions as\nthese elements of reality instead, we demonstrate that the criterion of\nphysical reality is actually one of observable predictability. We then examine\nthe relationship of realism-based non-locality to the Bell form and find that,\ndespite the flawed premise, this measure does indeed codify non-locality that\nis not captured by Bell inequalities.\n",

Kirch\n(married 1692) and their son Christfried Kirch (born 1694). Using excerpts from\nthe letters, some with drawings, we found some 35 sunspot groups (often for\nseveral days in a row or with interruptions) by Kirch and/or his letter\npartners (in three cases, only the month is given: 1704 Jan, Feb, 1707 Mar,\notherwise always the exact dates) - usually one group at a time. We also found\n17 explicit spotless days, several of them new (previously without any known\nobservations). We could constrain the heliographic latitude by Bayesian\ninference for 19 sunspot groups - five of them completely new (one group 1680\nMay 20-22 from Kirch and Ihle, one to two groups 1680 Jun 15-23 for Kirch, one\ngroup 1684 May 6 from Ihle, and one group 1688 Dec 14-15 from Kirch), while the\nothers mostly agree (within 2sigma) with previously published values for those\ndates by others. With these data, we then amend the butterfly diagram for the\nMaunder Minimum. By comparison of our data with the sunspot group catalog in\nHoyt & Schatten (1998), we noticed a number of discrepancies, e.g. that dates\nfor British observers in the Maunder Minimum (Flamsteed, Caswell, Derham,\nStannyan, Gray, and Sharp) as listed in Hoyt & Schatten (1998) are their\noriginal Julian dates, not converted to the Gregorian calendar (10-11 day\noffset in Hoyt & Schatten).

Folklore has it that no adequate definition of a localized\ngravitational stress-energetic quantity can be given. Most arguments to that\neffect invoke one version or another of the Principle of Equivalence. I argue\nthat not only are such arguments of necessity vague and hand-waving but, worse,\nare beside the point and do not address the heart of the issue. Based on a\nnovel analysis of what it may mean for one tensor to depend in the proper way\non another, which, \\emph{en passant}, provides a precise characterization of\nthe idea of a `geometric object', I prove that, under certain natural\nconditions, there can be no tensor whose interpretation could be that it\nrepresents gravitational stress-energy in general relativity. It follows that\ngravitational energy, such as it is in general relativity, is necessarily\nnon-local. Along the way, I prove a result of some interest in own right about\nthe structure of the associated jet bundles of the bundle of Lorentz metrics\nover spacetime. I conclude by showing that my results also imply that, under a\nfew natural conditions, the Einstein field equation is the unique equation\nrelating gravitational phenomena to spatiotemporal structure, and discuss how\nthis relates to the non-localizability of gravitational stress-energy. The main\ntheorem proven underlying all the arguments is considerably stronger than the\nstandard result in the literature used for the same purposes (Lovelock's\ntheorem of 1972): it holds in all dimensions (not only in four); it does not\nrequire an assumption about the differential order of the desired concomitant\nof the metric; and it has a more natural physical interpretation.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper we address a deeply interesting debate that took place at the\nend of the last millennia between David Mermin, Adan Cabello and Michiel\nSeevinck, regarding the meaning of relationalism within quantum theory. In a\nseries of papers, Mermin proposed an interpretation in which quantum\ncorrelations were considered as elements of physical reality. Unfortunately,\nthe very young relational proposal by Mermin was too soon tackled by specially\nsuited no-go theorems designed by Cabello and Seevinck. In this work we attempt\nto reconsider Mermin's program from the viewpoint of the Logos Categorical\nApproach to QM. Following Mermin's original proposal, we will provide a\nredefinition of quantum relation which not only can be understood as a\npreexistent element of physical reality but is also capable to escape Cabello's\nand Seevinck's no-go-theorems. In order to show explicitly that our notion of\nontological quantum relation is safe from no-go theorems we will derive a\nnon-contextuality theorem. We end the paper with a discussion regarding the\nphysical meaning of quantum relationalism.\n",

Today they are known to be bound states of\nquarks and anti-quarks of the two lightest flavours. They satisfy Bose\nstatistics, and are the lightest particles of the strong interaction spectrum.\nDetermination of the parameters of the Standard Model, including the masses of\nthe lightest quarks, has only recently reached high precision on the lattice.\nPions are also known to be pseudo-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken\napproximate axial-vector symmetries, and a probe of their properties and\ninteractions at high precision tests our knowledge of the strong interactions.\nWhile also being a probe of the solution of the strong interactions on the\ncomputer, which is known as lattice gauge theory. Despite their long history,\nthere are significant experimental and theoretical challenges in determining\ntheir properties at high precision. Examples include the lifetime of the\nneutral pion, and the status of their masses and decay widths in effective\nfield theories. Pion-pion scattering has been studied for several decades using\ngeneral methods of field theory such as dispersion relations based on\nanalyticity, unitarity and crossing. Knowledge from these theoretical methods\nare used to confront high precision experimental data, and to analyze them to\nextract information on their scattering and phase shift parameters. This\nknowledge is crucial for estimating the Standard Model contributions to the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which is being probed at Fermilab in\nongoing experiments. Other sensitive tests include the rare decay of the eta\nmeson into three pions, which represents an isospin violating decay. The\npresent article briefly reviews these important developments.\n",

        "summary": "  Local gauge theories are in a complicated relationship with boundaries.\nWhereas fixing the gauge can often shave off unwanted redundancies, the\ncoupling of different bounded regions requires the use of gauge-variant\nelements. Therefore, coupling is inimical to gauge-fixing, as usually\nunderstood. This sort of reasoning has led some to declare the coupling of\nsubsystems to be the raison d'\\^etre of gauge. Indeed, while gauge-fixing is\nentirely unproblematic for a single region without boundary, it introduces\narbitrary boundary conditions on the gauge degrees of freedom themselves --\nthese conditions lack a physical interpretation when they are not functionals\nof the original fields. Such arbitrary boundary choices creep into the\ncalculation of charges through Noether's second theorem, muddling the\nassignment of physical charges to local gauge symmetries. The confusion brewn\nby gauge at boundaries is well-known, and must be contended with both\nconceptually and technically. Here I explicate the problems mentioned above and\nillustrate a possible resolution: in a recent series of papers the notion of a\nconnection-form was put forward and implemented in the field-space of gauge\ntheories. Using this tool, a modified version of symplectic geometry -- called\n`horizontal' -- is possible. Independently of boundary conditions, this\nformalism bestows to each region a physically salient, relational notion of\ncharge: the horizontal Noether charge. Meanwhile, as required, the\nconnection-form mediates a peaceful composition of regions, one compatible with\nthe attribution of horizontal Noether charges to each region.\n",

In this paper\nI will argue against this assumption by attempting to prove the Unique History\nTheorem, which states, essentially, that conscious correlations to underlying\nquantum mechanical measurement events must increase with time and that every\nconscious state uniquely determines its history from an earlier conscious\nstate. By assuming only that consciousness arises from an underlying physical\nstate, I will argue that the physical evolution from a first physical state\ngiving rise to a conscious state to a second physical state giving rise to a\nlater conscious state is unique. Among the consequences of this theorem are\nthat: consciousness is not algorithmic and a conscious state cannot be uploaded\nto or simulated by a digital computer; a conscious state cannot be copied by\nduplicating a brain or any other physical state; and a conscious state cannot\nbe repeated or created de novo. These conclusions shed light on the physical\nnature of consciousness by rendering moot a variety of seemingly paradoxical\nphilosophy and science fiction problems.\n",

Modern discussions of the topic\ntend to use mid-19th century physics, neglecting both locality and Noether's\ntheorem and its converse. The relevance of General Relativity (GR) has rarely\nbeen considered. But a few authors have proposed that the non-localizability of\ngravitational energy and consequent lack of physically meaningful local\nconservation laws answers the conservation objection to mental causation:\nconservation already fails in GR, so there is nothing for minds to violate.\n  This paper is motivated by two ideas. First, one might take seriously the\nfact that GR formally has an infinity of rigid symmetries of the action and\nhence, by Noether's first theorem, an infinity of conserved energies-momenta\n(thus answering Schr\\\"{o}dinger's 1918 false-negative objection). Second, Sean\nCarroll has asked (rhetorically) how one should modify the\nDirac-Maxwell-Einstein equations to describe mental causation. This paper uses\nthe generalized Bianchi identities to show that General Relativity tends to\nexclude, not facilitate, such Cartesian mental causation. In the simplest case,\nCartesian mental influence must be spatio-temporally constant, and hence 0. The\ndifficulty may diminish for more complicated models. Its persuasiveness is also\naffected by larger world-view considerations.\n  The new general relativistic objection provides some support for realism\nabout gravitational energy-momentum in GR (taking pseudotensor laws seriously).\nSuch realism also answers an objection to theories of causation involving\nconserved quantities, because energies-momenta would be conserved even in GR.\n",

        "summary": "  Peter Bergmann and his students embarked in 1949 on a mainly canonical\nquantization program whose aim was to take into account the underlying\nfour-dimensional diffeomorphism symmetry in the transition from a Lagrangian to\na Hamiltonian formulation of Einstein's theory. They argued that even though\none seemed to destroy the full covariance through the focus on a temporal\nfoliation of spacetime, this loss was illusory. Early on they convinced\nthemselves that only the construction of classical invariants could adequately\nreflect the fully relativistic absence of physical meaning of spacetime\ncoordinates. Efforts were made by Bergmann students Newman and Janis to\nconstruct these classical invariants. Then in the late 1950's Bergmann and\nKomar proposed a comprehensive program in which classical invariants could be\nconstructed using the spacetime geometry itself to fix intrinsic spacetime\nlandmarks. At roughly the same time Dirac formulated a new criterion for\nidentifying initial phase space variables, one of whose consequences was that\nBergmann himself abandoned the gravitational lapse and shift as canonical\nvariables. Furthermore, Bergmann in 1962 interpreted the Dirac formalism as\naltering the very nature of diffeomorphism symmetry. One class of infinitesimal\ndiffeomorphism was to be understood as depending on the perpendicular to the\ngiven temporal foliation. Thus even within the Bergmann school program the\npreservation of the full four-dimensional symmetry in the Hamiltonian program\nbecame problematic. Indeed, the ADM and associated Wheeler-DeWitt program that\ngained and has retained prominence since this time abandoned the full symmetry.\nThere do remain dissenters - raising the question whether the field of quantum\ngravity has witnessed a Renaissance in the ensuing decades - or might the full\nfour-dimensional symmetry yet be reborn?\n",

Halley further argued that the occultation of\nAldebaran by the Moon on 11 March 509 in Athens confirmed the change in\nlatitude of Aldebaran. In fact, however, the relevant observation was almost\ncertainly made in Alexandria where Aldebaran was not occulted. By carefully\nconsidering measurement errors Jacques Cassini showed that Halley's results\nfrom comparison with earlier astronomers were spurious, a conclusion partially\nconfirmed by various later authors. Cassini's careful study of the measurements\nof the latitude of Arcturus provides the first significant evidence for proper\nmotion.\n",

        "summary": "  A recent series of experiments have demonstrated that a classical fluid\nmechanical system, constituted by an oil droplet bouncing on a vibrating fluid\nsurface, can be induced to display a number of behaviours previously considered\nto be distinctly quantum. To explain this correspondence it has been suggested\nthat the fluid mechanical system provides a single-particle classical model of\nde Broglie's idiosyncratic 'double solution' pilot wave theory of quantum\nmechanics. In this paper we assess the epistemic function of the bouncing oil\ndroplet experiments in relation to quantum mechanics. We find that the bouncing\noil droplets are best conceived as an analogue illustration of quantum\nphenomena, rather than an analogue simulation, and, furthermore, that their\nepistemic value should be understood in terms of how-possibly explanation,\nrather than confirmation. Analogue illustration, unlike analogue simulation, is\nnot a form of 'material surrogacy', in which source empirical phenomena in a\nsystem of one kind can be understood as 'standing in for' target phenomena in a\nsystem of another kind. Rather, analogue illustration leverages a\ncorrespondence between certain empirical phenomena displayed by a source system\nand aspects of the ontology of a target system. On the one hand, this limits\nthe potential inferential power of analogue illustrations, but, on the other,\nit widens their potential inferential scope. In particular, through analogue\nillustration we can learn, in the sense of gaining how-possibly understanding,\nabout the putative ontology of a target system via an experiment. As such, the\npotential scientific value of these extraordinary experiments is undoubtedly a\nsignificant one.\n",

But in what sense is it undesirable to have such\n'fine-tuning' of observables (and hence of the underlying model)? In this\npaper, we argue that the fine-tuning can be interpreted as a shortcoming of the\nexplanatory capacity of the model: in particular it signals a lack of\nexplanatory depth. In support of this argument, we develop a schema -- for (a\ncertain class of) models that arise broadly in physical settings -- that\nquantitatively relates fine-tuning of observables to a lack of depth of\nexplanations based on these models. We apply our schema in two different\nsettings in which, within each setting, we compare the depth of two competing\nexplanations. The first setting involves explanations for the Euclidean nature\nof spatial slices of the universe today: in particular, we compare an\nexplanation provided by the big-bang model of the early 1970s (where no\ninflationary period is included) with an explanation provided by a general\nmodel of cosmic inflation. The second setting has a more phenomenological\ncharacter, where the goal is to infer from a limited sequence of data points,\nusing maximum entropy techniques, the underlying probability distribution from\nwhich these data are drawn. In both of these settings we find that our analysis\nfavors the model that intuitively provides the deeper explanation of the\nobservable(s) of interest. We thus provide an account that relates two\n'theoretical virtues' of models used broadly in physical settings -- namely, a\nlack of fine-tuning and explanatory depth -- and argue that finely tuned models\nsacrifice explanatory depth.\n",

In\nparticular, the British physicist was in close contact with Bohr, Heisenberg\nand Pauli.

Similarly, he was considered\na physicist sympathetic with the positivistic attitude which shaped the\ndevelopment of quantum theory in the twenties.

        "summary": "  The \"measurement problem\" of quantum mechanics, and the \"hard problem\" of\ncognitive science are the most profound open problems of the two research\nfields, and certainly among the deepest of all unsettled conundrums in\ncontemporary science in general. Occasionally, scientists from both fields have\nsuggested some sort of interconnectedness of the two problems. Here we revisit\nthe main motives behind such expectations and try to put them on more formal\ngrounds. We argue not only that such a relation exists, but that it also bears\nstrong implications both for the interpretations of quantum mechanics and for\nour understanding of consciousness. The paper consists of three parts. In the\nfirst part, we formulate a \"no-go-theorem\" stating that a brain, functioning\nsolely on the principles of classical physics, cannot have any greater ability\nto induce subjective experience than a process of writing (printing) a certain\nsequence of digits. The goal is to show, with an attempt to mathematical rigor,\nwhy the physicalist standpoint based on classical physics is not likely to ever\nexplain the phenomenon of consciousness -- justifying the tendency to look\nbeyond the physics of the 19th century. In the second part, we aim to establish\na clear relation, with a sort of correspondence mapping, between attitudes\ntowards the hard problem and interpretations of quantum mechanics. Then we\ndiscuss these connections in the light of the no-go theorem, pointing out that\nthe existence of subjective experience might differentiate between otherwise\nexperimentally indistinguishable interpretations. Finally, the third part is an\nattempt to illustrate how quantum mechanics could take us closer to the\nsolution of the hard problem and break the constraints set by the no-go\ntheorem.\n",

I then argue that these theorems reflect on a\nformal level those practical and experimental settings that are needed to come\nto know the properties of physical systems. In particular, I discuss some\naspects of this relationist and contextualist conception of reality by\ncomparing, in their apparent diversity, Bohr holistic and Rovelli relationist\ninterpretation of the formalism, that deep down share a unifying metaphysics of\ndispositions and propensities. Both interpretations are based on the widely\nshared fact that quantum mechanics does not describe previously definite\nquantities. In the final part I show that, as a consequence of a relationist\nand perspectival approach to quantum mechanics, the quantum state of the\nuniverse regarded as an isolated system cannot be known in principle, so that\nthe universe must be described from within by dividing it into two arbitrary\nparts. This is in fact the only way in which any two systems can exchange\ninformation by being physically correlated.\n",

In overfilled sessions at the\nColl\\'{e}ge de France and the Sorbonne, Einstein explained his theories of\nrelativity, and prominent physicists, mathematicians and philosophers listened,\ndebated, questioned and explored facets of relativity. The 1922 visit had its\nechoes in the life and works of many who participated, particularly decisive\nfor Einstein and the philosopher Henri Bergson. This essay examines that\neventful visit, focusing on the physical and logical aspects of Bergson's\ncritique, with physics commentaries, linking prominent French physicists and\nmathematicians Langevin, Painlev\\'{e}, Hadamard, Becquerel, Sagnac, and\nKastler. I give particular attention to the logical and empirical accuracy of\nthe physics issues involved, delineating Bergson's exact reasoning for his\nphilosophical enthusiasm in Einstein's theory and for the ensuing critique.\nBergson's philosophical stand on duration and simultaneity is reassessed in the\ncontext of later developments in cosmological physics as well as the wealth of\nempirical data involving comparison of atomic clocks. Finally we are led\nnaturally to a surprising completion of the philosopher's program on universal\ntime, duration and simultaneity, in harmony with the time of the physicist. In\nthe appendices after the main text I also give the physics background and\neasily verifiable proofs for the assertions made in the text, pertaining to\nrelativity, simultaneity and time dilation, clearly distinguishing beliefs and\nfacts.\n",

They construct the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE)\nframework in response, which broadens those assumptions and allows for wider\ntesting under more flexible assumptions. Their methods are consistent with work\non confirmation and testing found in Carnap (1936), Hempel (1969), and Stein\n(1992, 1994), with the following principles in common: that confirmation is\ndistinct from testing, and that, counterintuitively, revising a theory's formal\nbasis can make it more broadly empirically testable. These views encourage a\nmethod according to which theories can be made abstract, to define families of\ngeneral structures for the purpose of testing. With the development of the ppE\nframework and related approaches, multi-messenger astronomy is a catalyst for\ndeep reasoning about the limits and potential of the theoretical framework of\ngeneral relativity.\n",

In peer review it is not required for this\nobjectivity to have correspondence to an outside world, instead it is enough\nfor it to operate inside the \"rules\" of the community. Neither is the\nobjectivity here empirical in the sense of using data about the scientific\nproblem in question. Rather, the objectivity is one of judgment, cleaving to\nthe epistemological standards of a community that are formed by background\nassumptions and beliefs. As a consequence, we highlight the role of\nsubjectivity in what is usually taken as a practice of objectivity, and arrive\nat the insight that objectivity is not defined by one core value, but a balance\nof transparency, confidentiality, trust, representation, and living up to\ncommunity standards. As such, objectivity in peer review is a highly specific\nsense of the term that is not reducible to that used in other aspects of\nscientific practice.\n",

        "summary": "  A number of problems in physics, mathematics, and philosophy involve\nobservers in given situations which lead to debates about whether\nobserver-specific information should affect the probability for some outcome or\nhypothesis. Our purpose is not to advocate for such observer selection effects,\nbut rather to show that any such effects depend greatly on the assumptions\nmade. We focus on the debate about the existence of a `Doomsday\neffect'---whether observer index information should cause one to favor\npossibilities with fewer observers, which has been argued to have implications\nfor models of cosmology. Our central goal is to reconcile the apparent\ninconsistencies in the literature by introducing a formalism to lay bare\nassumptions made and address a key issue that has not been clearly articulated\nin such problems: whether the observer is selected by *picking from* or *being\nin* a set of worlds. In the former there generally are observer selection\neffects, and in the latter there generally are not. This leads us to\ndifferentiate what we call *inclusive* from *exclusive* selection, and how they\nrelate to the concept of a multiverse. Then we relax the assumption that all\nobservers are equally typical, and consider the problem of Boltzmann brains,\nshowing that typicality can play a role in solving the problem. We then stress\nthe need for scale-invariant questions, which causes us to analyze J. Richard\nGott's approach to the problem. This all allows us to analyze the Doomsday and\nUniversal Doomsday arguments. We find that there is no Doomsday effect, absent\na set of assumptions we find somewhat unreasonable. Then we use our formalism\nto resolve a debate in the philosophy community called the `Sleeping Beauty\nProblem.' Finally, we conclude with a heuristic summary, free from equations,\nand point to possible future directions of this line of research.\n",

I propose a unified 'Humean' solution to the two problems. Humeanism allows\nus to incorporate the Past Hypothesis and the Statistical Postulate into the\nbest system, which we then use to simplify the quantum state of the universe.\nThis enables us to confer the nomological status to the quantum state in a way\nthat adds no significant complexity to the best system and solves the\n\"supervenient-kind problem\" facing the original version of the Past Hypothesis.\nWe call the resultant theory the Humean unification. It provides a unified\nexplanation of time asymmetry and quantum entanglement. On this theory, what\ngives rise to time's arrow is also responsible for quantum phenomena. The new\ntheory has a separable mosaic, a best system that is simple and non-vague, less\ntension between quantum mechanics and special relativity, and a higher degree\nof theoretical and dynamical unity. The Humean unification leads to new\ninsights that can be useful to Humeans and non-Humeans alike.\n",

I call\nthis phenomenon 'fundamental nomic vagueness.' I characterize fundamental nomic\nvagueness as the existence of borderline lawful worlds and the presence of\nseveral other accompanying features. Under certain assumptions, such vagueness\nprevents the fundamental physical theory from being completely expressible in\nthe mathematical language. Moreover, I suggest that such vagueness can be\nregarded as 'vagueness in the world.' For a case study, we turn to the Past\nHypothesis, a postulate that (partially) explains the direction of time in our\nworld. We have reasons to take it seriously as a candidate fundamental law of\nnature. Yet it is vague: it admits borderline (nomologically) possible worlds.\nAn exact version would lead to an untraceable arbitrariness absent in any other\nfundamental laws. However, the dilemma between fundamental nomic vagueness and\nuntraceable arbitrariness is dissolved in a new quantum theory of time's arrow.\n",

Consequently,\nBrownian motion now refers to the natural phenomenon but also to the theories\naccounting for it. There is no published work telling its entire history from\nits discovery until today, but rather partial histories either from 1827 to\nPerrin's experiments in the late 1900s, from a physicist's point of view; or\nfrom the 1920s from a mathematician's point of view. In this article, we tackle\nthe period straddling the two `half-histories' just mentioned, in order to\nhighlight continuity, to investigate the domain-shift from physics to\nmathematics, and to survey the enhancements of later physical theories. We\nstudy the works of Einstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin, Wiener, Ornstein and\nUhlenbeck from 1905 to 1934 as well as experimental results, using the concept\nof Brownian velocity as a leading thread. We show how Brownian motion became a\nresearch topic for the mathematician Wiener in the 1920s, why his model was an\nidealization of physical experiments, what Ornstein and Uhlenbeck added to\nEinstein's results, and how Wiener, Ornstein and Uhlenbeck developed in\nparallel contradictory theories concerning Brownian velocity.\n",

For this we review our previous study of the exact\nspatial orientation of twenty-one historic Christian churches currently\nexisting in the old part of La Laguna, which we compare with the analysis of\nsix similar buildings located in Santa Cruz, and presented here for the first\ntime. In both cities, we take the spatial orientation of historic churches as\ngood indicators of the original layout of the respective urban lattices.\nAlthough we find a clear orientation pattern for La Laguna, which singles out\nan absolute-value astronomical declination slightly below 20 degrees, pointing\nto a preferred date close to the July 25th feast-day of San Cristobal de Licia,\nin the case of Santa Cruz this trend is not followed. On the contrary, the\npattern we find for Santa Cruz, within the uncertainties due to the low\nstatistics, and apart from one equinoctial and one solstitial oriented\nchurches, is consistent with an orographic orientation within the canonic\nlimits of sunrise. This result highlights the uniqueness of the city of La\nLaguna, and supports the idea suggesting its deliberate planning in the early\n16th century.\n",

The scale is defined using fixed\npoints, which are temperatures of various phase transitions. Especially\nimportant has been the triple point of water at 273.1600 K. These fixed point\ntemperatures determine the international temperature scale ITS within the Si\nsystem. Temperature measurement itself is based on physical laws and on the\nproperties of appropriate thermometric materials selected to determine the\ntemperature scale. For determining the Boltzmann constant, new precision\ntechniques have been developed during the last two decades. Examples are\ndifferent types of gas thermometry, which ultimately are based on the ideal gas\nlaw, and thermal noise of electric charge carriers in conductors. With these\nmeans it has become possible to fix the value of the Boltzmann constant with a\nrelative uncertainty of < 1 ppm. As of 2019, the value of k has been agreed to\nbe fixed at 1.380649x10^(-23) J/K. This agreement replaces the earlier\ndefinition of a Kelvin degree.\n",

In this paper, we show that in\nItaly, however, the interest toward quantum foundations was revived at the turn\nof the 1960s, mainly thanks to the initiative of Franco Selleri, who started\ncriticising the contents and the practice of modern physics (in the context of\ncapitalistic society), and thought that the solution was to be sought in a\nrethinking of the foundations of the discipline. In 1969, supported by Luis de\nBroglie himself, Selleri wrote a paper reviving the idea of hidden variables\nand he successfully proposed to the Italian Physical Society to devote the\n\"Varenna School\" of 1970 to quantum foundations. This school's historical\npivotal importance is twofold: it gathered some of the most preeminent\ninternational physicists working on the foundations of quantum theory; and it\nprovided a first platform for young physicists to express their dissatisfaction\ntowards \"scientism\". In fact, Selleri's highly politicised views found the\nfavour of a critical mass of young, left-wing physicists, who made of quantum\nfoundations their main topic of research in the 1970s. Although these\nphysicists understood very early the central importance of Bell's theorem,\ntheir (ideological) aim was to demonstrate that quantum theory could have\nlimits of validity. Such a research program turned out to be unsuccessful, yet\nthe Italian endeavour was worldwide one of the first and most significant\nrevivals of the interest towards quantum foundations.\n",

While QBists deserve credit for their spirited defense of this\nposition, Niels Bohr urged it nearly a century ago, albeit in such elliptic\nways that the core of his message has been lost or distorted beyond\nrecognition. Then as now, the objectivity of empirical science was called into\nquestion. It was defended by Bohr along the lines of Kant's (then)\nrevolutionary theory of science, according to which the possibility of\nempirical science hinges on the possibility of thinking of experiences as\nexperiences of a system of interacting, re-identifiable objects. What Bohr\nadded to Kant's theory was his insight that empirical knowledge was not\nnecessarily limited to what is directly accessible to the senses, and that,\ntherefore, it does not have to be solely a knowledge of objects of sensible\nintuition. It can also be a knowledge of phenomena that are not objects of\nsensible intuition but instead are constituted by experimental contexts, which\nare objects of sensible intuition. Bohr's grounding of objectivity (or the\nobjectivity consistent with quantum mechanics), however, is weaker than Kant's\n(or the objectivity consistent with Newtonian physics). This conclusion is\nbased on an examination of Bohr's intentions in appealing to irreversible\namplification effects or the sufficient size and weight of the measurement\napparatus.\n",

Taking non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a case study, we\ndiscuss some of the challenges currently faced by a genuinely realistic stance.\nWe argue, first, that in the ontological aspect, realists are in the same boat\nas science, that is, without sufficient epistemic justification to adopt the\nbelief in the entities postulated by a single quantum theory, given that\nexperience (currently) is not able to decide between rival theories; in the\nmetaphysical aspect, realists also encounter problems with theory choice, given\nthe possibility of associating more than one metaphysical theory with the\ndescription of the entities postulated by each quantum theory. The same goes\nfor structuralist alternatives, since, even if we accept that scientific\ntheories are committed to the existence of structures, but not objects, we\nstill do not know what structures are, metaphysically. Finally, we move forward\nin the discussion with the meta-Popperian method, which serves to reduce the\nmetaphysical alternatives associated with the ontological postulates of\nscientific theories.

More generally for claimed sun daggers throughout the American\nSouthwest, the critical question is whether the ancient indigenous peoples\nintentionally placed the petroglyph so as to create a solar marker. The\nconfident starting point for proving the intentionality of sun daggers in\ngeneral is a histogram measured by the Prestons showing highly significant\npeaks for indicated declinations within 2{\\deg} of -23.4{\\deg}, 0.0{\\deg}, and\n+23.4{\\deg}, with this being not by chance. In a review of solsticial and\nequinoctal sun daggers, we find that they all have beams of light shaped like a\nlong-thin triangle with an apex opening angle of <40{\\deg} that touches the\ncenter of the petroglyph symbol. The majority of the sun daggers use a spiral\npetroglyph, with circles and other symbols being used. Where a spiral or\ncircular petroglyph has a coincidental light/shadow display, the false alarm\nrate is measured to be 20% to 33%. Sun daggers that have indicated declinations\nother than +-23.4{\\deg} or 0.0{\\deg} are false alarms, including claims for\nalignments to cross-quarter days and lunar standstills, which are certainly\nwrong. Intentional sun daggers are not related to any form of calendric\nregulation, astronomical tools, or public ceremony.

At that time, motive energy\nwas provided by work of humans and draft animals. Later, work of water and wind\npower was harnessed. During the 19$^{\\text{th}}$ century, steam power became\nthe main source of motive energy in USA and Britain. Modern transportation and\nindustry depend on the work of heat engines that use fossil fuel. A brief\nhistory of different sources of energy is presented in this work.

The\nlost opportunities for the Second Industrial Revolution (such as fast breeder\nreactors and thermonuclear power stations) are discussed. The case that the\nSolar Power will become the main source of energy by the second half of this\ncentury is presented. It is calculated that the Solar Power has the potential\nto bring about the new Industrial Revolution. Based on material and energy\nresources available in the Solar System, it is demonstrated that the Solar\nSystem Civilization supporting a population of 10 Quadrillion with a high\nstandard of living is possible.\n",

The fieldwork consisted of measuring the\nprecise coordinates of 38 churches, which represents almost all of the island's\nreligious constructions, which has an area of approximately 370 km2. For each\nchurch, we measured the azimuth and the angular height of the horizon taken in\nthe direction towards which the altar of each temple points. The data obtained\nwere corroborated with digital terrain models frequently used in\narchaeoastronomical studies. Finally, for the study of the sample, various\nanalyzes were carried out: statistical, calendarical and orographic, trying to\nfind clues that would allow us to understand the pattern of orientations found.\nFrom this analysis, we can infer that in some places the canonical tradition of\norienting Christian temples in the solar range was respected. Also, it is\npossible that a few constructions were oriented with imitation patterns of the\naborigine cult, especially in solstitial directions. However, we find that the\norientation of the majority of the churches is towards the northeast and, in\nthe absence of a better justification, we think that reason should be sought\nmore in the terrestrial landscape than in the celestial one. Judging by the way\nin which several small groups of temples are distributed, we estimate this\nunusual pattern of global orientations is motivated by the particular orography\nof the island. A significant proportion of churches seems to adapt to the\ncharacteristics of their sites, orienting themselves according to the numerous\ngeographical features where they are located. These results allow us to\nconjecture that the known \"abrupt nature\" of La Gomera is perhaps the main\nreason for the particular pattern of orientations of its worship sanctuaries.\n",

We choose a\nmaterialist/physicalist approach and find the simplest explanation for this\ncorrelation arises from the assumption that we possess agency. If a system has\nthe agency to choose an outcome then presumably it would choose a pleasant over\nan unpleasant one. Agency implementing preferences manifests itself as a force\nin a third person theory. If a preference is strong it gives rise to a force\ncausing a deterministic evolution, while weak preferences give rise to\nnon-deterministic evolutions. Quantum physics assigns a high degree of\nnon-determinism to large systems of qubits, a Knightian uncertainty, in which\none can not even assign probabilities to observed outcomes. This can give\nengineered systems the freedom to act on their preferences in ways not always\npredictable by an outside observer.

The book\nprovides a detailed development and defense of that idea, and it contains\ninteresting discussions about a wide range of philosophical issues such as\nrepresentation, probability, explanation, causation, objectivity, meaning, and\nfundamentality. Healey's project is at the intersection of physics and\nphilosophy. The book is divided into two parts.

As well known, Feynman was concerned about the relation of gravitation\nwith the rest of physics. Probably for this reason, he promoted an unusual,\nfield theoretical approach to general relativity, in which, after the\nrecognition that the interaction must be mediated by the quanta of a massless\nspin-$2$ field, Einstein's field equations should follow from the general\nproperties of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, plus self-consistency\nrequirements. Quantum corrections would then be included by considering loop\ndiagrams. These ideas were further developed by Feynman in his famous lectures\non gravitation, delivered at Caltech in 1962-63, and in a handful of published\npapers, where he also introduced some field theoretical tools which were soon\nrecognized to be of general interest, such as ghosts and the tree theorem. Some\noriginal pieces of Feynman's work on gravity are also present in a set of\nunpublished lectures delivered at Hughes Aircraft Company in 1966-67 and\ndevoted primarily to astrophysics and cosmology. Some comments on the relation\nbetween Feynman's approach to gravity and his ideas on the quantum foundations\nof the fundamental interactions are included.\n",

Expected to fetch around $3M, it\npromises to be the most expensive scientific manuscript ever sold at auction.\nIn this preprint, we present the parts of our forthcoming book, How Einstein\nFound His Field Equations. Sources and Interpretation (Springer, 2021) dealing\nwith Einstein's attempts, in 1913 and in 1915, to account for the anomalous\nadvance of Mercury's perihelion. In 1913, as documented in the Einstein-Besso\nmanuscript, Einstein and his friend Michele Besso found that the\nEinstein-Grossmann or Entwurf (= outline or draft) theory, a preliminary\nversion of general relativity, could only account for 18 of the 43\nseconds-of-arc-per-century discrepancy between Newtonian theory and\nobservation. In November 1915, however, putting the techniques developed in his\ncollaboration with Besso to good use, Einstein showed that his new general\ntheory of relativity could account for all missing 43 seconds of arc. After a\nbrief introduction, we provide an annotated transcription of the key pages of\nthe Einstein-Besso manuscript and an annotated new translation of the November\n1915 perihelion paper.\n",

Since these energetic events represent one of the most\nimportant components of space weather their study is of paramount importance to\nunderstand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being\nable to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally\nimportant. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current\naccurate observations from ground-based instruments or from space were not\navailable. Certainly, among these events we must include the great aurora of\nFebruary 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different\nregions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially\nfor its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the\ntransatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and\nEurope since 1866. In this paper we describe the main results of the\nobservations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the\nRoman College and described in his \"Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4\nFebbraio 1872\" for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note\nis extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of\nthese phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and\ntechnological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely\nrepresents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global\nscale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth.

As a result,\nphysicists have increasingly turned to model-independent strategies as tools in\nsearching for a wide range of possible BSM effects. In this paper, we describe\nthe Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SM-EFT) and analyse it in the\ncontext of the philosophical discussions about models, theories, and\n(bottom-up) effective field theories. We find that while the SM-EFT is a\nquantum field theory, assisting experimentalists in searching for deviations\nfrom the SM, in its general form it lacks some of the characteristic features\nof models. Those features only come into play if put in by hand or prompted by\nempirical evidence for deviations. Employing different philosophical approaches\nto models, we argue that the case study suggests not to take a view on models\nthat is overly permissive because it blurs the lines between the different\nstages of the SM-EFT research strategies and glosses over particle physicists'\nmotivations for undertaking this bottom-up approach in the first place. Looking\nat EFTs from the perspective of modelling does not require taking a stance on\nsome specific brand of realism or taking sides in the debate between reduction\nand emergence into which EFTs have recently been embedded.\n",

        "summary": "  In recent years the quantum foundations community has seen increasing\ninterest in the possibility of using retrocausality as a route to rejecting the\nconclusions of Bell's theorem and restoring locality to quantum physics. On the\nother hand, it has also been argued that accepting nonlocality leads to a form\nof retrocausality. In this article we seek to elucidate the relationship\nbetween retrocausality and locality. We begin by providing a brief schema of\nthe various ways in which violations of Bell's inequalities might lead us to\nconsider some form of retrocausality. We then consider some possible\nmotivations for using retrocausality to rescue locality, arguing that none of\nthese motivations is adequate and that therefore there is no clear reason why\nwe should prefer local retrocausal models to nonlocal retrocausal models. Next,\nwe examine several different conceptions of retrocausality, concluding that\n`all-at-once' retrocausality is more coherent than the alternative dynamical\npicture. We then argue that since the `all-at-once' approach requires\nprobabilities to be assigned to entire histories or mosaics, locality is\nsomewhat redundant within this picture. Thus we conclude that using\nretrocausality as a way to rescue locality may not be the right route to\nretrocausality. Finally, we demonstrate that accepting the existence of\nnonlocality and insisting on the nonexistence of preferred reference frames\nleads naturally to the acceptance of a form of retrocausality, albeit one which\nis not mediated by physical systems travelling backwards in time. We argue that\nthis is the more natural way to motivate retrocausal models of quantum\nmechanics.\n",

By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of\ninferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory\nfallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that\ndeploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and\nBayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\\it\nmap-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the\nuniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their\nenvironments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the\nprinciple of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP\nunder this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach\nto the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool.

It had developed under the founder Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn into one of\nthe leading astronomical research institutes in the world. When van Rhijn took\nover at the retirement of Kapteyn, it was in the process of coordinating\nKapteyn's Plan of Selected Areas. Van Rhijn's research was solid and\nprofessional work, but in his papers he invariably stopped before discussing\nhow his findings did fit into the larger scheme of things. He maybe was\nunimaginative but it did lack the link to the larger view towards the emerging\npicture of the structure of the Galaxy. Van Rhijn was unfortunate to be\nhampered throughout almost his complete directorate by factors, that severely\nlimited his attempts to obtain more funding in spite of local support by his\nuniversity. These were of course in the first place the Great Depression of the\n1930s and the Second World War and its aftermath, while during most of the\n1940s he suffered from tuberculosis. But also the remote location of Groningen\ncompared to Leiden, where a major infrastructure led by three important\nprotegees of Kapteyn was in place, and the governmental bias towards support\nfor Leiden over Groningen was an important factor. Finally I examine the\ndevelopments in the 1950s and the circumstances that made Adriaan Blaauw accept\nhis appointment as van Rhijn's successor in 1957 and initiate the beginnings of\nthe revival under his leadership.\n",

The leitmotif of this work is a\ndialectical view of the world: any smooth motion in nature is the consequence\nof the interplay and dynamical balance between pairs of opposite elements of\nthe motion. We stress that the opposite property here differs from the common\nsense of opposing elements (of conflicting appearance but of same nature) such\naction/reaction forces between two bodies. The opposite elements here are\nincompatible and mutual exclusive in nature, with contrasting and complementary\ncharacteristics such as active/passive, disorder/order, curvature/flatness,\netc. The dynamical balance is defined by an invariant variational relationship\nbetween all the pairs of opposite elements active in the considered motion.\nFrom this idea, an axiomatization of quantum mechanics is proposed in addition\nto the derivation of several existing variational principles of mechanics.\n",

The deconstruction of this cosmology in terms of the\nphilosophical questions of the 17th century suggests an uncertainty in the time\ndimension.

In a \"chaology\",\none should fully appreciate that different systems may use different clocks.\nCommunication systems can be considered as contingent in space and time:\nsubstances contain force or action, and they communicate not only in\n(observable) extension, but also over time. While each communication system can\nbe considered as a system of reference for a special theory of communication,\nthe addition of an evolutionary perspective to the mathematical theory of\ncommunication opens up the possibility of a general theory of communication.\n",

The authors supported their claim using a report of a\nhistoric Chinese observation of a comet ostensibly colliding with Earth's\natmosphere in AD 773 January. We show here that the Chinese text presented by\nthose authors is not an original historic text, but that it is comprised of\nseveral different sources. Moreover, the translation presented in Liu et al. is\nmisleading and inaccurate. We give the exact Chinese wordings and our English\ntranslations. According to the original sources, the Chinese observed a comet\nin mid January 773, but they report neither a collision nor a large coma, just\na long tail. Also, there is no report in any of the source texts about \"dust\nrain in the daytime\" as claimed by Liu et al. (2014), but simply a normal dust\nstorm. Ho (1962) reports sightings of this comet in China on AD 773 Jan 15\nand/or 17 and in Japan on AD 773 Jan 20 (Ho 1962). At the relevant historic\ntime, the Chinese held that comets were produced within the Earth's atmosphere,\nso that it would have been impossible for them to report a \"collision\" of a\ncomet with Earth's atmosphere. The translation and conclusions made by Liu et\nal. (2014) are not supported by the historical record. Therefore, postulating a\nsudden increase in 14C in corals off the Chinese coast precisely in mid January\n773 (Liu et al. 2014) is not justified given just the 230Th dating for AD 783\n\\pm 14.\n",

In the History of al-Tabari we found two\n(almost identical) reports about such an event. The group around caliph\nal-Mansur observed a transient event while on the way from Baghdad to Mecca on\nAD 775 Aug 29 - Sep 1 (Julian calendar). A celestial object (kawkab) was seen\nto fall or set (inqadda), and its trace (atharuhu) was seen for at least tens\nof minutes (up to 70-90 min) during morning twilight. The reports use the\nArabic words kawkab and athar(uhu), which were also used in the known Arabic\nreports about supernovae SN 1006 and 1054, so that one might consider an\ninterpretation as a nova-like event. The kawkab (celestial object) was observed\nonly during the morning twilight at a brightness of probably between about -3\nand 0 mag. Such a brightness and time-scale would be expected for optical\nkilonovae (at 3 to 9 kpc) in the context of short Gamma-Ray Bursts. There are\nno similar reports from eastern Asia for this time. However, the short reports\nare fully consistent with a bolide: The word kawkab can be used for meteor, the\nverb inqadda normally means \"falling down\", the word atharuhu can mean \"its\ntrace\". We therefore prefer the interpretation as bolide. We discuss in detail\nhow to convert the Muslim calendar date to a date in the Julian calendar using\nfirst the calculated Islamic calendar and then considering the time when the\ncrescent new moon could be visible at the given location.\n",

At that time Popper gave active contribution to the research in physics,\nof which the most significant is a new version of the EPR thought experiment,\nalleged to test different interpretations of quantum mechanics. The genesis of\nsuch an experiment is reconstructed in detail, and an unpublished letter by\nPopper is reproduced in the present paper to show that he formulated his\nthought experiment already two years before its first publication in 1982. The\ndebate stimulated by the proposed experiment as well as Popper's role in the\nphysics community throughout 1980s is here analysed in detail by means of\npersonal correspondence and publications.\n",

After first devoting himself to chemistry, in 1836\nhe obtained a position as an astronomy assistant at the Ecole Polytechnique.\nThis choice will decide his future career which culminates with the discovery\nof Neptune in 1846. Le Verrier wrote more than 200 contributions in the Comptes\nRendus de l'Acad\\'emie des Sciences. These contributions are very varied: some\noriginal articles but also reports on publications published elsewhere,\nsometimes even simple notes of a single page. The whole set gives a very vivid\nvision of the development of the science of the XIXth century. At that time,\nthe Comptes Rendus are really a reflection of the debates of the sessions of\nthe Academy. They are published very quickly, and leave a large freedom of\nspeech to the authors.

This idea has reappeared on occasion (e.g., Poincar\\'{e}) but\ndidn't become key in space-time foundations prior to Brown's \\emph{Physical\nRelativity} (at the end, the interpretive key to the book). A crucial\ndifference between his constructivism and orthodox \"space-time realism\" is\nmodal scope. Constructivism applies to all local classical field theories,\nincluding those with multiple geometries. But the orthodox view provincially\nassumes a unique geometry, as familiar theories (Newton, Special Relativity,\nNordstr\\\"{o}m, and GR) have. They serve as the orthodox \"canon.\" Their\nhistorical roles suggest a story of inevitable progress. Physics literature\nafter c. 1920 is relevant to orthodoxy mostly as commentary on the canon, which\nclosed in the 1910s. The orthodox view explains the behavior of matter as the\nmanifestation of the real space-time geometry, which works within the canon.\nThe orthodox view, Whiggish history, and the canon relate symbiotically.\n  If one considers a theory outside the canon, space-time realism sheds little\nlight on matter's behavior. Worse, it gives the wrong answer when applied to an\nexample arguably in the canon, massive scalar gravity with universal coupling.\nWhich is the true geometry---the flat metric from the Poincar\\'{e} symmetry,\nthe conformally flat metric exhibited by material rods and clocks, or both---or\nis the question bad? How does space-time realism explain that all matter fields\nsee the same curved geometry, given so many ways to mix and match?\nConstructivist attention to dynamical details is vindicated; geometrical\nshortcuts disappoint. The more exhaustive exploration of relativistic field\ntheories (especially massive) in particle physics is an underused resource for\nfoundations.\n",

Heisenberg's discovery of quantum mechanics, which, the article argues,\ncould, in retrospect, be considered in quantum-informational terms, while,\nconversely, quantum information theory could be seen in Heisenbergian terms.\nThe article takes advantage of the circumstance that any instance of quantum\ninformation is a \"structure\"--an organization of elements, ultimately bits, of\nclassical information, manifested in measuring instruments. While, however,\nthis organization can, along with the observed behavior of measuring\ninstruments, be described by means of classical physics, it cannot be predicted\nby means of classical physics, but only, probabilistically or statistically, by\nmeans of quantum mechanics, or in high-energy physics, by means of quantum\nfield theory (or possibly some alternative theories within each scope). By\ncontrast, the emergences of this information and of this structure cannot, in\nthe present view, be described by either classical or quantum theory, or\npossibly by any other means, which leads to the concept of \"structure without\nlaw\" and the viewpoint of structural nnnrealism.

We illustrate our approach through an analysis of a measure\nof spatial complexity proposed by one of us called Configuration Entropy (CE),\nand establish a link between experience at the cognitive level and information\ncontent, showing that the CE is a quantitative measure of how much information\nin spatial-complexity the external world hides from an EA.\n",

These gaps, I suggest, emerge from the mathematics of\nself-reference, and the logical barriers to prediction that self-referring\nsystems present. Still, a mathematical truth does not imply a physical one: the\nuniverse need not have made self-reference possible. It did, and the question\nthen is how.

In order to deal with such a problem,\nFeynman designed a theoretical \"reference amplifier\", thus enabling a\ncharacterization of the distortion by means of a benchmark relationship between\nphase and amplification for each frequency, and providing a standard tool for\ncomparing the operation of real devices. A general theory was elaborated, from\nwhich he was able to deduce the basic features of an amplifier just from its\nresponse to a pulse or to a sine wave of definite frequency. Moreover, in order\nto apply such a theory to practical problems, a couple of remarkable examples\nwere worked out, both for high-frequency cutoff amplifiers and for\nlow-frequency ones. A special consideration deserves a mysteriously exceptional\namplifier with best stability behavior introduced by Feynman, for which\ndifferent physical interpretations are here envisaged. Feynman's earlier work\nthen later flowed in the Hughes lectures on Mathematical Methods in Physics and\nEngineering of 1970-71, where he also remarked on causality properties of an\namplifier, that is on certain relations between frequency and phase shift that\na real amplifier has to satisfy in order not to allow output signals to appear\nbefore input ones.

Most\nphysicists are content with foregoing such metaphysical issues, falling back on\nBohr's Copenhagen interpretation, and then get on with the business of doing\nphysics. I suspect that Carroll would criticize these physicists as being too\ndismissive of the wonderful mysteries of quantum mechanics by relegating its\nrole to that of an algorithm for making predictions. Quite to the contrary, I\nmaintain that those who still pursue a resolution to the measurement problem\nare burdened with a classical view of reality and fail to truly embrace the\nfundamental quantum aspects of nature.\n",

In this article, I will close this gap by studying the implications of\ndynamical density functional theory (DDFT), a central method of modern\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics not previously considered in philosophy of\nphysics, for this debate. For this purpose, the philosophical discussion of\nirreversibility is structured into five problems, concerned with the source of\nirreversibility in thermodynamics, the definition of equilibrium and entropy,\nthe justification of coarse-graining, the approach to equilibrium and the arrow\nof time. For each of these problems, it is shown that DDFT provides novel\ninsights that are of importance for both physicists and philosophers of\nphysics.\n",

Not only\nwere they born in the same year, but were also both senior wranglers, received\nthe Smith's Prizes and Copley medals, lived, thought and researched at Pembroke\nCollege, and shared an appreciation of Newton. On the other hand, Adams'\nprediction of Neptune's location had absolutely no influence on its discovery\nin Berlin. His lunar theory did not offer a physical explanation for the Moon's\nmotion. The origin of the Leonids was explained by others before him. Adams\nrefused a knighthood and an appointment as Astronomer Royal.

The maths and calculations at which he so excelled mark one of\nthe high points of celestial mechanics, but are rarely taught nowadays in\nundergraduate courses. The differences and similarities between Adams and\nStokes could not be more striking. This volume attests to the lasting legacy of\nStokes' scientific work. What is then Adams' legacy?

According to the specialized literature, it is\nnot even clear if each of these microscopic entities possess their own\nidentity. Recently, Jonas Arenhart proposed a distinction of quantum objects in\nterms of a dilemma which forces a choice between their characterization either\nas individuals or as non-individuals. In this work we attempt to address the\n(metaphysical) presuppositions involved within Arenhart's dilemma which ground\nthe question of individuality in QM on a strong presupposition regarding the\nexistence of quantum objects. After providing a reconsideration of the role\nplayed by metaphysics within physics we attempt to propose, not only a complete\nredefinition of the dilemma beyond particle metaphysics, but also a possible\nrealist solution grounded on the provision of a new (non-classical) conceptual\nframework which seeks to develop an invariant-objective representation of the\ntheory of quanta.\n",

In order to do so, we\nbegin by providing a critical analysis of the famous measurement problem which,\nwe will argue, was originated by the strict application of the\nempirical-positivist requirements to subsume the quantum formalism under their\nspecific understanding of 'theory'. In this context, the ad hoc introduction of\nthe projection postulate (or measurement rule) can be understood as a necessary\nrequirement coming from a naive empiricist standpoint which presupposes that\nobservations are self evident givens of \"common sense\" experience --independent\nof metaphysical (categorical) presuppositions. We then turn our attention to\ntwo \"non-collapse\" interpretations of QM --namely, modal and many worlds--\nwhich even though deny that the \"collapse\" is a real physical process anyhow\nretain the measurement rule as a necessary element of the theory. In\ncontraposition, following Einstein's claim according to which \"it is only the\ntheory which decides what can be observed\", we propose a return to the realist\nrepresentational understanding of 'physical theories' in which 'observation' is\nconsidered as derived from theoretical presuppositions. It is from this\nstandpoint that we discuss a new non-classical conceptual representation which\nallows us to understand quantum phenomena in an intuitive (anschaulicht)\nmanner. Leaving behind the projection postulate, we discuss the general\nphysical conditions for measuring and observing quantum superpositions.\n",

That, and that alone, makes for the difference between the quantum\nand Gibbs concepts of indistinguishability.

A\ncausal agent is an autonomous physical system, maintained in a steady state,\nfar from thermal equilibrium, with special subsystems: sensors, actuators, and\nlearning machines. Using feedback, the learning machine, driven purely by\nthermodynamic constraints, changes its internal states to learn probabilistic\nfunctional relations inherent in correlations between sensor and actuator\nrecords. We argue that these functional relations just are causal relations\nlearned by the agent, and so such causal relations are simply relations between\nthe internal physical states of a causal agent. We show that learning is driven\nby a thermodynamic principle: the error rate is minimised when the dissipated\npower is minimised. While the internal states of a causal agent are necessarily\nstochastic, the learned causal relations are shared by all machines with the\nsame hardware embedded in the same environment. We argue that this dependence\nof causal relations on such `hardware' is a novel demonstration of causal\nperspectivalism.\n",

It is thus of interest to see how physical theories have\nbeen developed along the line of Kant and Hegel. Einstein became interested in\nhow things appear to moving observers. Quantum mechanics is also an\nobserver-dependent science. The question then is whether quantum mechanics and\nrelativity can be synthesized into one science. The present form of quantum\nfield theory is a case in point. This theory however is based on the algorithm\nof the scattering matrix where all participating particles are free in the\nremote past and in the remote future. We thus need, in addition, a\nLorentz-covariant theory of bound state which will address the question of how\nthe hydrogen atom would look to moving observers. The question is then whether\nthis Lorentz-covariant theory of bound states can be synthesized with the field\ntheory into a Lorentz-covariant quantum mechanics. This article reviews the\nprogress made along this line. This integrated Kant-Hegel process is\nillustrated in terms of the way in which Americans practice their democracy.\n",

At the end of the century, the\nFlorence Observatory - or Specola - was built instead on a tower at the same\nlevel as the city's centre. As soon as astronomers started to use this\nobservatory, they recognized all its flaws and struggled to search for a better\nlocation. Giovanni Battista Donati, director of the Specola of Florence from\nthe eve of the Italian Unification in 1859, finally succeeded in creating a new\nobservatory: first, he obtained funds from the Parliament of the Kingdom of\nItaly to build an equatorial mount for the Amici 28-cm refractor, which could\nnot be installed conveniently in the tower of the Specola; then, he went\nthrough the process of selecting a proper site, seeking funds and finally\nbuilding Arcetri Observatory. Although Donati was a pioneer of spectroscopy and\nastrophysics, his intent was to establish a modern observatory for classical\nastronomy, as the Italian peninsula did not have a national observatory like\nthose located in many foreign capitals - Florence was the capital of the\nKingdom of Italy from 1865 to 1871. To promote the project, Donati made use of\nwritings by one of the most authoritative European astronomers, Otto Wilhelm\nStruve. The paper describes all these steps, eventually leading to the final\ninauguration of the Arcetri Observatory in 1872, almost 150 years ago.\n",

In this theory, probabilities arise within a physical theory from\nstatistical behavior of almost all initial conditions. The main advantage of\ntypicality frequentism is that it shows which kinds of probabilities (that also\nhave empirical relevance) can be derived from physics. Although one cannot\nrecover all probability talk in this account, this is rather a virtue than a\nvice, because it shows which types of probabilities can in fact arise from\nphysics and which types need to be explained in different ways, thereby opening\nthe path for a pluralistic account of probabilities.\n",

At first data taking, the versatility\nof the experiment as a general-purpose detector in the forward region also\nbecame evident, with measurements achievable such as electroweak physics, jets\nand new particle searches in open states. These were facilitated by the\nexcellent capability of the detector to identify muons and to reconstruct decay\nvertices close to the primary pp interaction region. By the end of the LHC Run\n2 in 2018, before the accelerator paused for its second long shut down, LHCb\nhad measured the CKM quark mixing matrix elements and CP violation parameters\nto world-leading precision in the heavy-quark systems. The experiment had also\nmeasured many rare decays of b and c quark mesons and baryons to below their\nStandard Model expectations, some down to branching ratios of order 10-9. In\naddition, world knowledge of b and c spectroscopy had improved significantly\nthrough discoveries of many new resonances already anticipated in the quark\nmodel, and also adding new exotic four and five quark states.\n",

In this paper,\nwe introduce a variant of computational irreducibility that intends to capture\nmore accurately aspects of actual (as opposed to apparent) free agency:\ncomputational sourcehood, i.e. the phenomenon that the successful prediction of\na process' behavior must typically involve an almost-exact representation of\nthe relevant features of that process, regardless of the time it takes to\narrive at the prediction.

Firstly, the formalism of the consistent histories approach will be\noutlined.\n  Secondly, the works by Robert Griffiths and Roland Omn\\`es will be discussed.\nGriffiths' seminal 1984 paper, the first physicist to have proposed a\nconsistent-histories interpretation of quantum mechanics, followed by Omn\\`es'\n1990 paper, were instrumental to the consistent-histories model based on\nBoolean logic.\n  Thirdly, Murray Gell-Mann and James Hartle's steps to their own version of\nconsistent-histories approach, motivated by a cosmological perspective, will\nthen be described and evaluated. Gell-Mann and Hartle understood that\nspontaneous decoherence could path the way to a concrete physical model to\nGriffiths' consistent histories.\n  Moreover, the collective biography of these figures will be put in the\ncontext of the role played by the Santa Fe Institute, co-founded by Gell-Mann\nin 1984 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Hartle is also a member of the external\nfaculty.\n",

Often recognized as the symbolic birth of the nuclear age, Trinity's\nmultifaceted legacy remains just as captivating and complex as it did 75 years\nago. This paper examines why the test was necessary from a technical\nstandpoint, shows how Los Alamos scientists planned the event, and explores the\nphysical and emotional aftermaths of Trinity. The author also uses rarely\naccessed original records to reconstruct the story of Trinity's health hazards,\nas seen through the eyes of radiation technicians and medical doctors as events\nunfolded. Trinity was conducted as the Potsdam Conference began, weeks after\nthe collapse of Nazi Germany. It was considered necessary to let President\nHarry S. Truman know whether the United States possessed a nuclear capability\nahead of his negotiations with Joseph Stalin, the Soviet premier. The author\nexamines the competing priorities that drove the timetable for the test:\ninternational politics, security and safety. Three weeks after Trinity, a\ngun-assembled enriched-uranium bomb called Little Boy was used against the\nJapanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, Fat Man, a weaponized version of\nthe imploding Trinity device, was dropped on Nagasaki. The author briefly\nexamines these strikes and what impact they may have had on the Japanese\nsurrender. The paper concludes by examining the legacy of the Trinity test 75\nyears into the age it helped usher in.\n",

        "summary": "  The Christy Gadget is the informal name for the plutonium device detonated in\nthe Trinity test on July 16, 1945. In September 1944, Robert Christy, working\nin the theoretical implosion group, proposed a novel concept that altered the\ndesign of the nuclear core in Fat Man. While scientists originally intended to\nuse a hollow sphere of plutonium, this design entailed substantial risk, due to\nthe likelihood of asymmetries resulting from implosion. Christy proposed\nchanging the design to a solid sphere of plutonium with a modulated neutron\nsource, and the design was eventually adopted, tested at Trinity, and used in\nthe attack on Nagasaki. While there is no question regarding the important role\nthat Christy played in demonstrating its feasibility as a reliable design,\nthere is a debate as to who initially proposed the idea; though most sources\nhave attributed this invention to Christy, some historical sources have\nattributed credit to Christy's group leader, Rudolf Peierls, or indeed other\nscientists. This paper seeks to outline and resolve this dispute. We present\nnew unclassified evidence extracted from previously unavailable sources (to\nunclassified audiences) from the National Security Research Center archives at\nLos Alamos National Laboratory. This evidence consists of 1945-1946 patent\ndocumentation, oral history interview tapes of Christy and Peierls, and monthly\n1944 progress reports from the Theoretical Division. Though Christy and Peierls\nshare joint credit on the patent, both Christy's and Peierls' words and\nwritings, together with sources from Hans Bethe and Edward Teller, support the\ntraditional view that Christy was indeed the originator of the idea. While\nChristy does deserve the majority of the credit for the invention and design,\nwe acknowledge the important role Peierls and von Neumann played in its\ndevelopment.\n",

To study this symmetry, we develop a\ngeneral framework for symmetries that distinguishes the observable and surplus\nstructures of a theory by using the minimal freely specifiable initial data for\nthe theory that is necessary to achieve empirical adequacy. This framework is\nthen applied to well-studied examples including Galilean invariance and the\nsymmetries of the Kepler problem. We find that our framework gives a precise\ndynamical criterion for identifying the observables of those systems, and that\nthose observables agree with epistemic expectations. We then apply our\nframework to dynamical similarity. First we give a general definition of\ndynamical similarity.

Second, it introduces and compares two proposals\nfor gravitational energy and momentum, one of which is very influential in\nphysics: and, so far as I know, neither of the two has been discussed in the\nphilosophical literature. Third, it assesses these proposals in connection with\nrecent philosophical discussions of energy and momentum in general relativity.\n  After briefly reviewing the debates about energy conservation between\nHilbert, Klein, Noether and Einstein, I give Noether's two theorems. I show\nthat Einstein's gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor, including its\nsuperpotential, is fixed, through Noether's theorem, by the boundary terms in\nthe action. That is, the freedom to add an arbitrary superpotential to the\ngravitational pseudo-tensor corresponds to the freedom to add boundary terms to\nthe action without changing the equations of motion. This freedom is fixed in\nthe same way for both problems. I also review two proposals for energy and\nmomentum in GR, of which one is a quasi-local alternative to the local\nexpressions, and the other builds on Einstein's local pseudo-tensor approach. I\ndiscuss the recent philosophical literature on the conservation of energy and\nmomentum in general relativity, and I assess and compare the two proposals in\nthe light of this literature: especially, in light of questions about\ndiffeomorphism invariance and background-independence.\n",

His\nproof was criticized as being logically circular, by Grete Hermann soon after,\nand as fundamentally flawed, by John Bell in 1964. Bell's severe criticism of\nNeumann's proof and the explicit (counter) example of a hidden variable model\nfor the measurement of a quantum spin are considered by most researchers,\nthough not all, as the definitive demonstration that Neumann's proof is\ninadequate. Despite being an argument of mathematical physics, an ambiguity of\ndecision remains to this day. I show that Neumann's assumption of the linear\nadditivity of the expectation values, even for incompatible (noncommuting)\nobservables, is a necessary constraint related to the nature of observable\nphysical variables and to the conservation laws. Therefore, any theory should\nnecessarily obey it to qualify as a physically valid theory. Then, obviously,\nthe hidden variable theories with dispersion-free ensembles that violate this\nassumption are ruled out. I show that it is Bell's counter-example that is\nfundamentally flawed, being inconsistent with the factual mechanics. Further,\nit is shown that the local hidden variable theories, for which the Bell's\ninequalities were derived, are grossly incompatible with the fundamental\nconservation laws. I identify the intrinsic uncertainty in the action as the\nreason for the irreducible dispersion, which implies that there are no\ndispersion-free ensembles at any scale of mechanics. With the unconditional\nvalidity of its central assumption shown, Neumann's proof is fully resurrected.\n",

These arguments rest on a likelihood calculation that\npenalizes models in proportion to the number of distinguishable observers. I\nargue that such reasoning leads to solipsism, the belief that one is the only\nbeing in the world, and is therefore unacceptable. Using variants of the\n\"Sleeping Beauty\" thought experiment as a guide, I present a framework for\nevaluating observations in a large cosmos: Weighted Fine Graining (WFG). WFG\nrequires the construction of specific models of physical outcomes and\nobservations. Valid typicality arguments then emerge from the combinatorial\nproperties of third-person physical microhypotheses. Indexical\n(observer-relative) facts do not directly constrain physical theories, but\ninstead weight different provisional evaluations of credence. As indexical\nknowledge changes, the weights shift. I show that the self-applied Doomsday\nArgument fails in WFG, even though it can work for an external observer.

It was painted sometime between 1480 and 1493\nand shows five zodiacal constellations, three boreal and six austral. The Sun\nand Mercury are also represented. It formed part of a three times larger vault\ndepicting the 48 Ptolemaic constellations and the rest of the planets known at\nthe time. This was a splendid work of art that covered the ceiling of the first\nlibrary of the University of Salamanca, one of the oldest in Europe having\nobtained its royal charter in 1218. But it was also a pioneering scientific\nwork: a planetarium used to teach astronomy, the first of its kind in the\nhistory of Astronomy that has come down to us in the preserved part that we now\ncall \"The Sky of Salamanca\". We describe the scientific context surrounding the\nchair of Astrology founded around 1460 at the University of Salamanca, which\nled to the production of this unique scientific work of art and to the\nflourishing of Astronomy in Salamanca. We analyse the possible dates compatible\nwith it, showing that they are extremely infrequent. In the period of 1100\nyears from 1200 to 2300 that we studied there are only 23 years that have\nfeasible days. We conclude that the information contained in \"El Cielo de\nSalamanca\" is not sufficient to assign it to a specific date but rather to an\ninterval of several days that circumstantial evidence seems to place in August\n1475. The same configuration of the sky will be observable, for the first time\nin 141 years, from the 22nd to the 25th of August 2022. The next occasion to\nobserve it live will be in 2060.\n",

The instants of solstices and\nequinoxes, the \\textit{Anni Cardines}, obtained by comparing transit timings of\nSun and Sirius, also in daytime, are affected either by the East deviation of\nthe meridian line of about 5' Eastward (geometrical effect), either by the\nstellar aberration of Sirius (relativistic effect). Similarly the seasonal\nshifts of Sirius' declination observed by Bianchini are here firstly recognized\nas depending on the stellar aberration in ecliptic latitude. The eccentricity\nof the Earth's orbit and the orientation of its axis in the space can be\nmeasured, since Ptolemy, by knowing the exact timing of the solstices and the\nequinoxes. The dates of 1703 equinoxes and solstices have been published by\nFrancesco Bianchini in local roman mean time, referred to the local (roman)\nmean noon, i.e. after the solar meridian mean transit time. By using the\nobservations of the three lunar eclipses of 1703 we found the equation of time\nfor that year, and the UTC corresponding timings of the beginning of the\nseasons.

Wilhelm Lenz suggested his student Ernst Ising to\nexplain the existence of ferromagnetism on the basis of his publication in\n1920. The result, published in 1925 was disappointing, because only the one\ndimensional case could be solved with a negative result about the absence of\nferromagnetism. Wolfgang Pauli who was an assistant of Lenz in Hamburg\npublished in the same year his 'nonclassical ambiguity', later identified as\nthe spin of the electron, and the exclusion principle. He was the first - at\nthe Solvay Conference in 1930 - to present the Hamiltonian of the Ising model\nas we know it today.\n  Meanwhile Ising had left university research and due to the political\nsituation in 1938 had to leave Germany and fled to Luxemburg. This went in hand\nwith damaging the network of researchers dealing with the problem of\nferromagnetism and more generally with phase transitions and statistical\nphysics. In 1944, the year when Luxemburg was liberated by the American troops\nand Ising and his family was rescued, Lars Onsager presented a solution of the\ntwo-dimensional case. In 1952 Chen-Ning Yang solved the problem of Ising's\nthesis in two dimensions; one year later Ising became the US citizenship. The\nfollowing development showed, that the model turned out to be a highway to\nmodern physics concepts applicable also in other fields, although the final\nexact solution in three dimensions has not yet been reached.\n",

In this line of thought, a scientific\nrealist is someone who believes in the objective existence of the entities\npostulated by our best scientific theories. In metaphysical terms, what does\nthat mean? In ontological terms, i.e., in terms about what exists, scientific\nrealism can be understood as involving the adoption of an ontology that is\nscientifically informed. But according to some philosophers, the realistic\nattitude must go beyond ontology. The way in which this requirement has been\nunderstood involves providing a metaphysics for the entities postulated by\nscience, that is, answering questions about the nature of what ontology admits\nto exist. We discuss how two fashionable approaches face the challenge of\nproviding a metaphysics for science: a form of naturalism and the\nViking/Toolbox approach. Finally, we present a third way, which adopts the best\nof both approaches: the meta-Popperian method, which focuses on discarding the\nwrong alternatives, or better saying, the metaphysical profiles incompatible\nwith certain theories. We present the meta-Popperian method, a metametaphysical\nmethod capable of objectively assessing which metaphysical profiles are\nincompatible with certain scientific theories. For this, we will use quantum\nmechanics as a case study, presenting some previously obtained results. As our\nfocus is on methodological questions about the relationship between metaphysics\nand science; with this method, we can see how science can be used to avoid\nerror in metaphysical issues. In our opinion, this would be a way to develop a\nproductive relationship between science and metaphysics.\n",

A more thorough approach focuses on the\nprobability of the interval, not on its size. Most attempts to measure the\nprobability of the life-permitting interval for a given parameter rely on a\nBayesian statistical approach for which the prior distribution of the parameter\nis uniform. However, the parameters in these models often take values in spaces\nof infinite size, so that a uniformity assumption is not possible. This is\nknown as the normalization problem. This paper explains a framework to measure\ntuning that, among others, deals with normalization, assuming that the prior\ndistribution belongs to a class of maximum entropy (maxent) distributions. By\nanalyzing an upper bound of the tuning probability for this class of\ndistributions the method solves the so-called weak anthropic principle, and\noffer a solution, at least in this context, to the well-known lack of\ninvariance of maxent distributions. The implication of this approach is that,\nsince all mathematical models need parameters, tuning is not only a question of\nnatural science, but also a problem of mathematical modeling. Cosmological\ntuning is thus a particular instantiation of a more general scenario.\nTherefore, whenever a mathematical model is used to describe nature, not only\nin physics but in all of science, tuning is present. And the question of\nwhether the tuning is fine or coarse for a given parameter -- if the interval\nin which the parameter is located has low or high probability, respectively --\ndepends crucially not only on the interval but also on the assumed class of\nprior distributions. Novel upper bounds for tuning probabilities are presented.\n",

Although the history and cultural aspects of these missions and their\nmost iconic buildings have been extensively studied, the archaeoastronomy of\nthe Guaran\\'i peoples of the Province of Paraquaria (Province of Paraguay) has\nonly been recently considered, with the existing studies focusing primarily on\nthe orientation of their churches. The paper presented here, which is the first\narchaeoastronomical study of the Jesuit missions of Chiquitos in eastern\nBolivia, is an attempt to continue and complement the previous\narchaeoastronomical studies of the region. The methodologies employed involved\nthe analysis of the Jesuit churches that currently exist in this region,\nnamely, the on-site measurements of the orientations of eight churches\ncurrently standing and the ruins of a ninth church of which only a\nfree-standing bell tower and parts of the side walls remain preserved. The\norientation measurements of a tenth church, which we were unable to visit, were\ndetermined via the use of satellite maps. The landscape surrounding these\nchurches was then examined in detail and furthermore, a detailed cultural and\nhistorical study of the characteristics of the villages where the churches are\nlocated was carried out. Our results show that, unlike the churches of the\nProvince of Paraquaria where meridian orientations in the north-south direction\nstand out, half of the studied churches have shown potential canonical\norientations that seem to be aligned to solar phenomena, with three exhibiting\nprecise equinoctial orientation. We propose reasons for these orientations,\nincluding the possible relevance of illumination effects on significant\ninternal elements within the churches - effects that were generally sought in\nBaroque church architecture.\n",

Despite this, the theoretical underpinnings of the Anthologies have\nbeen understudied; in general, the work has been overshadowed by Ptolemy's\ncontemporaneous Tetrabiblos. While the Tetrabiblos explicitly aims to present a\nsystematic account of astrology, Valens' work is often characterised as a\nmiscellaneous collection, of interest to historians only for the evidence it\npreserves about the practical methods used in casting horoscopes. In this\narticle, we argue that the Anthologies is also an invaluable resource for\nengagement with the conceptual basis of astrology. As a case study, we take a\nsection of Anthologies Book 1 which lists the possible astrological effects of\nplanets, both alone and in 'combinations' of two and three. We demonstrate that\nanalysing Valens' descriptions quantitatively with textual analysis reveals a\nconsistent internal logic of planetary combination. By classifying descriptive\nterms as positive or negative, we show that the resulting 'sentiment' of\nplanetary combinations is well-correlated with their component parts.\nFurthermore, we find that the sentiment of three-planet combinations is more\nstrongly correlated with the average sentiment of their three possible\ncomponent pairs than with the average sentiment of individual planets,\nsuggesting an iterative combinatorial logic. Recognition of this feature of\nastrological practice has been neglected compared to the mathematical methods\nfor calculating horoscopes. We argue that this analysis not only provides\nevidence that the astrological lore detailed in Valens is more consistent than\nis often assumed, but is also indicative of a wider methodological technique in\npractical astrology: combinatorial reasoning from existing astrological lore.\n",

        "summary": "  The relational interpretation of quantum mechanics (RQM), introduced in its\npresent form by Carlo Rovelli in 1996, involves a number of significant\ndepartures from other QM interpretations widely discussed in the literature. We\nbegin here by summarizing these unique RQM features, with a focus on those that\nsuggest altered insights into the nature of the randomness exhibited in QM\nphenomena. One of these RQM features is the assumption that all objects in the\nuniverse are quantum objects, regardless of their material complexity. And, the\ninteraction of any two objects can result in new relational quantum states of\neach of the objects with the other as reference. But such new states do not\nreplace relational states corresponding to previous interactions with other\nreference objects. In particular, such earlier relational states that include a\nvariable considered to be random do not collapse to define a determined value\nof the variable, but instead simply take on that specific value in the state\nrelative to the new reference. The concept of randomness associated with\nquantum state variables in RQM thus differs from that in other QM\ninterpretations. Rather than take the usual pedantic approach of elaborate\nside-by-side comparisons between the RQM and other common QM interpretations,\nwe illustrate these differences by describing in some detail the well-known\n\"dual-slit\" experiment in terms of RQM concepts, pointing out the important\nadvantages over other interpretations along the way. Of course, we suggest no\nchange in dual-slit experiment results, but believe that the interpretative\nmodifications are helpful and profound.\n",

        "summary": "  Despite quantum theory's remarkable success, many philosophers worry that it\nnonetheless lacks some crucial connection between theory and experiment. One\nunder-discussed aspect of the Quantum Measurement Problems is that it is\nsometimes unclear how to model our measurement processes in order to extract\nexperimental predictions. Without a solution to these pragmatic worries,\nquantum theory would be at risk of losing both its evidential support and its\nphysical salience. Avoiding these risks requires solving the Pragmatic\nMeasurement Problem. For non-relativistic quantum theory, this problem has been\nsolved as follows: One can model each of quantum theory's key experimental\nsuccesses on a case-by-case in terms of measurement chains and Heisenberg cuts.\nFrom here, one can then strive for a wide-scoping measurement theory capable of\nmodeling all (or nearly all) possible measurement processes. Indeed, for\nnon-relativistic quantum theory this leads us to our usual projective\nmeasurement theory.\n  But how does this story have to change when we move into the context of\nquantum field theory (QFT)? It is well known that in QFT almost all localized\nprojective measurements violate causality, allowing for faster-than-light\nsignaling. Despite this, I will argue that we can proceed largely as we did in\nthe non-relativistic case. We first ought to build up a case-by-case\nmeasurement framework for QFT by using measurement chains and Heisdenberg-like\ncuts (where we switch from a QFT model to a non-QFT model). We can then strive\nfor both a new measurement theory for QFT and an empirically meaningful\ncharacterization of its observables. It is at this point that significantly\nmore theoretical work is needed. This paper ends by briefly reviewing the state\nof the art in the physics literature regarding the modeling of measurement\nprocesses involving quantum fields.\n",

One\nmay be tempted here to appeal to the laws of nature, or to the world's\ngeometric structure, or even to the smooth topological structure of the\nspacetime manifold itself. Some think, however, that the metaphysics involved\nin such explanatory strategies is excessively spooky. Indeed, some opt to\nreverse the arrow of explanation, putting dynamics first. For instance, one can\nuse Lewis's Best Systems Analysis (BSA) to view the laws of nature as merely\nbeing codifications of certain patterns in the dynamical behavior of matter.\nSimilarly, one can use Huggett's Regularity Relationism to achieve an analogous\nview of the world's geometric structure. At present, however, there is no such\ndynamics-first view of the spacetime manifold itself. This dissertation puts\nforward such a view: The spacetime manifold is merely a codification of certain\npatterns in the dynamical behavior of matter.\n  This dissertation develops powerful mathematical tools for investigating and\nnegotiating between a wide variety of spacetime settings for a wide range of\nspacetime theories. From here, a competition between different spacetime\ncodifications is invoked analogous to the competition between different\nlaw-like codifications in Lewis's BSA. Whereas the BSA judges law-like\ncodifications based on their balance of simplicity and strength, spacetime\ncodifications are to be judged by how well they fit the theory's dynamics and\nkinematics.\n",

This paper\ndefends a functionalist account of three-dimensional entities in the context of\nWave Function Realism (WFR), that can explain in detail how we can recover\nthree-dimensional entities out of the wavefunction. In particular, the essay\nadvocates for a novel version of WFR in terms of a functional reductionist\napproach in the style of David Lewis. This account entails reduction of the\nupper entities to the bottom ones, when the latter behave appropriately. As\napplied to WFR, it shows how the wavefunction can turn out to be identical to\nthree-dimensional objects, provided certain conditions. The first major goal of\nthe paper is thus to put forward an improved and more rigorous version of WFR,\nwhich dissolves several extant issues about the theory, and can serve as a\nstarting point for the future literature about the topic. Moreover, the second\nmajor goal of the article is to take WFR as a case study to demonstrate the\npros of functional reductionism, especially in the form defended here, thereby\nhelping to bring this view back in the philosophy of science debate. The\npositive upshots of this paper suggest a possible application of functional\nreductionism also to other contexts.\n",

In 1965,\nwhen the existence of the cosmological constant $\\lambda$ seemed unnecessary to\nmost cosmologists, he renewed interest in the problem by emphasizing a material\ninterpretation of de Sitter space (i.e., the space curved in the presence of\n$\\lambda$). According to that interpretation, the curvature is produced by a\ncosmological vacuum (now identified as dark energy of the universe). In 1970,\nGliner proposed a description of exponential expansion (or contraction) of the\nuniverse at the early (or late) evolution stage dominated by cosmological\nvacuum. In 1975, Gliner (with I.G. Dyminikova) suggested a model of the early\nuniverse free of Big Bang singularity, and developed a scenario of nonsingular\nFriedmann cosmology. Many of these findings were used in the modern inflation\nscenarios of the universe, first proposed by A.A. Starobinsky (1979) and A.\nGuth (1981) and greatly multiplied later. However, these inflation scenarios\ndiffer from the scenario of Gliner and Dymnikova, and Gliner's contribution to\ncosmology is nearly forgotten. The history and the essence of this contribution\nare outlined, as well the difference from the inflation theories.\n",

Because of the\nphysical limitations of observing time and instrument sensitivity, datasets are\nrarely complete. However, determining specifically what is missing from any\nsample is not always straightforward. For example, there are always more faint\nobjects (such as galaxies) than bright ones in any brightness-limited sample,\nbut faint objects may not be of the same kind as bright ones. Assuming they are\ncan lead to mischaracterizing the population of objects near the boundary of\nwhat can be detected. Similarly, starting with nearby objects that can be well\nobserved and assuming that objects much farther away (and sampled from a\nyounger universe) are of the same kind can lead us astray. Demographic models\nof galaxy populations can be used as inputs to observing system simulations to\ncreate ``mock'' catalogues that can be used to characterize and account for\nmultiple, interacting selection effects. The use of simulations for this\npurpose is common practice in astronomy, and blurs the line between\nobservations and simulations; the observational data cannot be interpreted\nindependent of the simulations. We will describe this methodology and argue\nthat astrophysicists have developed effective ways to establish the reliability\nof simulation-dependent observational programs. The reliability depends on how\nwell the physical and demographic properties of the simulated population can be\nconstrained through independent observations. We also identify a new challenge\nraised by the use of simulations, which we call the ``problem of uncomputed\nalternatives.'' Sometimes the simulations themselves create unintended\nselection effects when the limits of what can be simulated lead astronomers to\nonly consider a limited space of alternative proposals.\n",

This\nincludes the first main idea we will need in Part II: namely, that two\nspacetime points in different possible situations are never strictly identical\n-- they are merely counterparts.\n  In Section 3, we report -- and rebut -- more recent claims to \"dissolve\" the\nargument. Our rebuttal is based on the fact that in differential geometry, and\nits applications in physics such as general relativity, points are in some\ncases identified, or correspond with each other, between one context and\nanother, by means other than isometry (or isomorphism). We call such a\ncorrespondence a threading of points. This is the second main idea we shall use\nin Part II.\n",

Since our experience shows\nthat this is not the case, there must be more to the observers than their\nstructure.

They claim that time reversal should correspond to the mere\nreversal of the temporal order of the instantaneous states, without any\naccompanying change of the instantaneous state as in the standard view. As\nsuch, Albert and Callender claim, these theories are not time reversal\ninvariant. The view of Albert and Callender has been much criticized, with many\nphilosophers arguing that time reversal may correspond to more than the\nreversal of the temporal order. In this paper, we will not so much engage with\nthat aspect of the debate, but rather deflate the disagreement by exploiting\nthe ontological underdetermination.

This turned on the perception that Niels Bohr\navoided addressing the measurement problem by taking an instrumentalist view of\nquantum mechanics. I argue that this view is mistaken and Bohr's interpretation\nof quantum mechanics is realist. Moreover, Bohr's interpretation, which is\ndifferent from textbook quantum mechanics (which is due more to Von Neumann and\nPaul Dirac), succeeds in solving the measurement problem. While the claim that\nBohr dissolves the measurement problem within the limits of the epistemological\nframework he assumes has been made by a few authors, rarely has the case been\nmade that Bohr's project unambiguously and completely overcomes the measurement\nproblem. I make the strong case that Bohr eliminated the measurement problem\naltogether. For this, I put forward two new postulates through which to make\nsense of Bohr's interpretation. The article thus seeks to single out Bohr's\ninterpretation from the various views that go together under the umbrella of\northodox quantum mechanics, and which have been traditionally considered\nsusceptible to the measurement problem. It shows that Bohr's interpretation\nshould be classified along with those like hidden variable theories, collapse\nmodels, modal interpretations etc., which offer a solution to the measurement\nproblem and are committed to a realist ontology.\n",

It is also shown that\nthe basic mesoamerican relation between the full solar 365 day calendar and the\nshort one of 260 days given by: 365 x 52 = 260 x 73 is Kepler's third law of\norbital motion between Earth's period of time about the Sun and an imaginary\nsynodic orbit with a 260 day period.

We begin by defining a memory system as any physical system\nwhose present state can provide information about the state of the external\nworld at some time other than the present. We then identify two types of memory\nsystems in our universe, along with an important special case of the first\ntype, which we distinguish as a third type of memory system.\n  We show that two of these types of memory system are time-symmetric, able to\nprovide knowledge about both the past and the future. However, the third type\nof memory systems exploits the second law of thermodynamics in all of its\ninstances we find in our universe. The result is that in our universe, this\ntype of memory system only ever provides information about the past. Finally,\nwe argue that human memory is of this third type, completing the argument.

The outcome, however, is that we are still\nuncertain whether these rules should be implemented and how they should be\ninterpreted and assessed from the philosophical point of view. Based on a\ndetailed examination of the group-theoretic reformulation of (relativistic and\nnon-relativistic) quantum mechanics that prompts physicists to impose\nsuperselection rules, I shall argue that the implementation of these rules\ninvolves serious heuristic and epistemological concerns. Considering this\nargument, I shall conclude that there are suitable philosophical reasons to\nclaim that the implementation of superselection rules should be rejected and\nthat there are certain circumstances when the formulation of a theory should be\nmodified.\n",

The general interpretation of physics\nstrongly assumes the duality of the observer and the world, and the uniqueness\nof the world though the relational interpretation suggested different\nconclusions: {\\ it no properties, no interaction}, and {\\ it facts are\nrelative}. These conclusions are seemingly counterintuitive, though this work\nshows that similar conclusions are found in the interpretation of soft matter\nbased on the concept of intermediate asymptotics. The interpretation of soft\nmatter based on intermediate asymptotics also concludes that the properties are\nnot determined without the scale. This is due to the conclusion of intermediate\nasymptotics that any formalization and its interpretation are localized by the\nscale. It is demonstrated that the similarity between the two interpretations\noriginated from its monism of relations. This logical structure is also\ncompared with the works in other disciplines. This work reports the insight\nthat the relational interpretation can be a general and fundamental concept,\nnot the one applicable to special cases.\n",

We show, in fact, that a whole class of theories--of which MWI is a\nprime example--fails to satisfy some basic tenets of science which we call\nfacts about natural science. The problem of approaches the likes of MWI is\nthat, in order to reproduce the observed empirical evidence about any concrete\nquantum measurement outcome, they require as a tacit assumption that the theory\ndoes in fact apply to an arbitrarily large range of phenomena, and ultimately\nto all phenomena. We call this fallacy the holistic inference loop, and we show\nthat this is incompatible with the facts about natural science, rendering MWI\nuntenable and dooming it to be refuted.\n",

I take reduction in philosophers' sense; and I argue that the\nprospects are good for there being a reduction of the type envisaged by Nagel.\n(I also discuss the prospects for the stronger functionalist variant of\nNagelian reduction, that was formulated by Lewis.)\n  One main theme will be causal set theory's use of a physical scale (viz. the\nPlanck scale) to formulate how it recovers a Lorentzian manifold. This use\nillustrates various philosophical topics relevant to reduction, such as\nlimiting relations between theories, and the role of analogy. I also emphasise\ncausal set theory's probabilistic method, viz. Poisson sprinkling: which is\nused both for formulating the reduction and for exploring its prospects.\n",

He was convinced that the sidereal system was built up of\nclouds of stars in a smooth, low-density stratum. In addition there were dark\nclouds together with streaks with little or no extinction in between. Pannekoek\nlooked at bright star clouds and estimated their distance from their\ncontribution to star counts. He found values of tens of kpc, which would mean\ntheir distribution was similar in extent to that of Shapleys globular cluster\nsystem. Later he had to reduce his distance by a factor over two, and later\nstill retract the method. He developed a rigorous method of estimating\ndistances of dark clouds from modeling star counts off and on the cloud,\npreceding Wolf's quick and dirty method. He should have received more credit\nfor this. He started isophotal maps of the northern and southern Milky Way,\nfirst from visual observations, later from photographic surface photometry\nusing out-of-focus exposures. I compare Pannekoeks maps with detailed\nphotographic surface photometry of the south by the group in Bochum and to the\nalmost all-sky mapping by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, free of zodiacal light,\nfrom beyond the asteroid belt. This shows Panneloeks maps to be surprisingly\naccurate. The legacy of Pannekoek in the area of Galactic research consists of\nhis mapping of the structure of the nearby part of the Galaxy, the distances of\ndark clouds, and isophotal maps of the Milky Way. His other contributions\nturned out inconclusive or wrong as a result of his conviction, resulting from\nhis many years of observing and mapping the Milky Way, that the nearby\ndistribution is characterized primarily by more or less isolated clouds of\nstars and by dust restricted to isolated dark clouds and streaks.\n",

It also shows the way the physical and mathematical\nsciences operate, allowing us to accurately describe the observed regularities\nin terms of communicable mathematical laws. The latter say nothing about the\nintrinsic features of things. They only refer to the observed regularities in\ntheir behaviors, providing rigorous descriptions of how the universe works, to\nwhich any viable ontology must conform. Classical mechanistic determinism\nlimits everything that can occur to what happens in an instant and leaves no\nroom for novelty or any intrinsic aspect that is not epiphenomenal. The\nsituation changes with quantum probabilistic determinism if one takes seriously\nthe ontology that arises from its axioms of objects, systems in certain states,\nand the events they produce in other objects. As Bertrand Russell pointed out\nalmost a century ago, an ontology of events, with an internal phenomenal\naspect, now known as panprotopsychism, is better suited to explaining the\nphenomenal aspects of consciousness. The central observation of this paper is\nthat many objections to panpsychism and panprotopsychism, which are usually\ncalled the combination problem, arise from implicit hypotheses based on\nclassical physics about supervenience. These are inappropriate at the quantum\nlevel, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. The\nanalysis imposes conditions on the possible implementations of quantum\ncognition mechanisms in the brain.\n",

It is shown that Late Antique scholars who were\nactively involved in the construction of the Christian history's chronology\nwere limited in their choices by the astronomical peculiarities of the\nEarth-Moon system. The total conjunctions of the astronomical Solar and Lunar\ncalendars took place, some within the 1st century CE, and the next one, in 483\nCE. This was also a special year because the lunar calendar lost one day. Thus\nthe 5th century was the time of heightened expectations of whether the calendar\nand the Moon's showings will repeat those that accompanied the birth of Jesus.\nThe Full Supermoon (or whatever phase it was on December 25th, 1 BCE) may have\nrepeated in 410 CE (the entry of Goths into Rome), in 467 CE and in 476 CE (the\nFall of the Roman Empire), marking the coming of the time very similar to\nJesus' birth. The Full Moon was supposed to repeat December 25th, 800 CE and in\nthe year 1000 CE. This may have determined the setting of the biblical calendar\nin a way that put the birth of Christ on 5199 CE (making the year 800 CE, the\nyear of the Full Supermoon or of its phase on December 25th, 1 BCE) a critical\nturning point.\n",

Are there absolute facts about the\nproperties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this\nagain a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known\nform) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP),\nand thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a\ncrucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction\noutcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the\nwidespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead\nnecessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts.\nI conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist\nversions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the\nneed for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration\nprinciple for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.\n",

More vexingly for\nworking scientists, none of the approaches stands out as uncontroversially\npreferable over its rivals in terms of its rationally warranted promise, i.e.\nthe reasons to further work on, explore and develop it. We demonstrate this\nclaim by applying a Peircean economic model of pursuit-worthiness in terms of a\ncognitive cost/benefit estimate -- with the instantiation of theory virtues as\nkey indicators of cognitive gains -- to the four main Dark Energy proposals\n(the cosmological constant approach, modified gravity, quintessence, and\ninhomogeneous cosmologies).

By evaluating previous successes of the guiding\nprinciple of technical naturalness, we restrict its applicability to\nnon-fundamental phenomena in the realm of provisional theories within limited\nenergy scales. In view of further breaches of autonomy of scales in apparently\nfundamental phenomena outside particle physics, the hierarchy problem of the\nHiggs mass is instead reinterpreted as an indication of the ontologically\nfundamental status of the Higgs boson. Applying the concept of Selective\nRealism justifies this seemingly contradictory attribution within the effective\ntheories of the standard model of particle physics. Moreover, we argue that the\nongoing naturalness debate about the Higgs mass is partly based on the\nadherence to the methodology of effective theories (often claimed to be\nuniversally applicable), for which there is no justification when dealing with\npresumably fundamental phenomena such as the Higgs mechanism, even if it is\nembedded into an effective theory.\n",

In 1977, when this\nconference series took the name of StatPhys, the foundational role of the\nFlorence conference was recognized by retrospectively naming it StatPhys1. This\npaper examines the dual scientific and social significance of the conference,\nsituating it in the broader contexts of the post-World War II reconstruction in\nItalian physics and of the revitalization of the international science\norganization. Through an analysis of IUPAP archives and Italian records, we\nillustrate how the event's success hinged on the aligned objectives of its\norganizers. Internationally, it was instrumental in defining the scientific and\norganizational foundations for the activities of IUPAP commissions during a\ncritical phase of IUPAP's history, when the Union was resurging on the\ninternational scene after the inactivity of the interwar period. Nationally,\nthe conference served as a cornerstone in SIF's strategy to re-establish\nItalian physics' international stature and to aid the domestic revitalization\nof physics through the internationalization of its activities, notably of its\nflagship journal, \\textit{Il Nuovo Cimento}.

Surprisingly,\nthis endeavor has only received very little attention in philosophy. Here I\nargue that this should change. This is because, on the one hand,\nreconstructions can help us to better understand quantum mechanics, and, on the\nother hand, reconstructions are themselves in need of interpretation. My\noverall objective, thus, is to motivate the reconstruction program and to show\nwhy philosophers should care. My specific aims are threefold. (i) Clarify the\nrelationship between reconstructing and interpreting quantum mechanics, (ii)\nshow how the informational reconstruction of quantum theory puts pressure on\nstandard realist interpretations, (iii) defend the quantum reconstruction\nprogram against possible objections.\n",

These\nreconstructions are formulated in an operational framework, deriving the\nformalism from information-theoretic principles. It has been recognized that\nthis project is in tension with standard Psi-ontic interpretations. This paper\npresupposes that the quantum reconstruction program (QRP) (i) is a worthwhile\nproject and (ii) puts pressure on Psi-ontic interpretations. Where does this\nleave us? Prima facie, it seems that Psi-epistemic interpretations perfectly\nfit the spirit of information-based reconstructions. However, Psi-epistemic\ninterpretations, understood as saying that the wave functions represents one's\nknowledge about a physical system, recently have been challenged on technical\nand conceptual grounds. More importantly, for some researchers working on\nreconstructions, the lesson of successful reconstructions is that the wave\nfunction does not represent objective facts about the world. Since knowledge is\na factive concept, this speaks against epistemic interpretations. In this\npaper, I discuss whether Psi-doxastic interpretations constitute a reasonable\nalternative. My thesis is that if we want to engage QRP with Psi-doxastic\ninterpretations, then we should aim at a reconstruction that is spelled out in\nnon-factive experiential terms.\n",

The analysis is based on the assumption that observers apply principles\nof optimism or pessimism about theory building in a coherent way. On this\nbasis, we provide a rough assessment of the current range of plausible\ncredences in low energy SUSY and determine in which way LHC data changes those\ncredences. For observers who had been optimistic about low energy SUSY before\nthe LHC, the method reports that LHC data does lead to decreased credences in\naccordance with intuition. The decrease is moderate, however, and keeps\nposteriors at very substantial levels. The analysis further establishes that a\nvery high but not yet indefensible degree of pessimism regarding the success\nchances of theory building still results in quite significant credences in GUT\nand low energy SUSY for the time right before the start of the LHC. The\npessimist's credence in low energy SUSY remains nearly unchanged once LHC data\nis taken into account.\n",

This means that Hubble tensions were\nalways present in the literature, due either to the underestimation of\nstatistical error bars associated with the observed parameter measurements, or\nto the fact that systematic errors were not properly taken into account in many\nof the measurements.\n  The fact that the underestimation of error bars for $H_0$ is so common might\nexplain the apparent 4.4-sigma discrepancy by Riess et al. As a matter of fact,\nmore recent precise $H_0$ measurements with JWST data by Freedman et al. using\nstandard candles in galaxies find there is no tension with CMBR data, possibly\nindicating that previously Riess et al. had underestimated their errors.\n  Here we have carried out a recalibration of the probabilities. The tension of\n4.4-$\\sigma $, estimated between the local Cepheid-supernova distance ladder\nand cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, is indeed a 2.1-$\\sigma $ tension\nin equivalent terms of a normal distribution, with an associated probability\n$P$ = 0.036 (1 in 28). This can be increased to an equivalent tension of\n2.5-$\\sigma $ in the worst cases of claimed 6-$\\sigma $ tension, which may in\nany case happen as a random statistical fluctuation.\n  If Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, and present day\ntensions are not more important than previous ones, why, then, is there so much\nnoise and commotion surrounding Hubble tension after 2019? It is suggested here\nthat this obeys a sociological phenomenon of ``groupthink''.\n",

This was done by drawing numerous\nparallels with the human conceptual domain and suggesting the existence of a\nlevel of cognitive activity that would underlie our physical reality.

The S-matrix formalism\nis based on running waves, while bound-state problem are based on normalizable\nwave functions which are standing waves. Wave functions contained in the S\nmatrix are analytic continuations of running waves, and they do not in general\nsatisfy the localization condition for bound states.\n  These days, there are very serious questions raised against string theory.

In spite of the more than\nthirty years of its existence it did not make any empirically testable\npredictions. And it is completely unknown which physically interpretable\nprinciples could form the basis of string theory. At the moment, \"string\ntheory\" is no theory at all, but rather a labyrinthic structure of mathematical\nprocedures and intuitions which get their justification from the fact that\nthey, at least formally, reproduce general relativity and the standard model of\nelementary particle physics as low energy approximations. However, there are\nnow strong indications that string theory does not only reproduce the dynamics\nand symmetries of our standard model, but a plethora of different scenarios\nwith different low energy nomologies and symmetries. String theory seems to\ndescribe not only our world, but an immense landscape of possible worlds. So\nfar, all attempts to find a selection principle which could be motivated\nintratheoretically remained without success. So, recently the idea that the low\nenergy nomology of our world, and therefore also the observable phenomenology,\ncould be the result of an anthropic selection from a vast arena of\nnomologically different scenarios entered string theory. Although multiverse\nscenarios and anthropic selection are not only motivated by string theory, but\nlead also to a possible explanation for the fine tuning of the universe, they\nare concepts which transcend the framework defined by the epistemological and\nmethodological rules which conventionally form the basis of physics as an\nempirical science.\n",

However, the influence of this great mind was not limited to science.\nAs it is well known, his fingerprint remains engraved in many aspects of our\ndaily life. Because of that, in this work we have tried to cover almost all the\nsubjects in which Einstein was involved during the last century and, of course,\ntry and reveal the future projection his actions will have in this new century\nthat has just begun. Among the subjects covered in the volume one can find the\npossible connection between Einstein and the artistic vanguard movement, his\nreligiosity, his days in Argentina, the Nobel Prize, the Einstein-Freud\ncorrespondence, his pacifism and the nuclear energy, science and politics under\nthe Second Empire and the Weimar Republic, and even a description of his\npatents and experiments, the studies performed to search for \"built-in\"\nfeatures in his brain and the doubts many had regarding whether Einstein was a\ngenius or a crank.

However, in recent decades it has been increasingly often alleged that\nthe data-analysis of the expedition's leaders was faulty and biased in favor of\nEinstein's theory. Arthur Stanley Eddington is particularly alleged to have\nbeen prejudiced in favor of general relativity. Specifically it is claimed that\nsome of the data, which would have favored the so-called Newtonian prediction,\nwas thrown out on dubious grounds. This paper argues that a close examination\nof the views of the expedition's organizers, and of their data analysis,\nsuggests that they had good grounds for acting as they did, and that the key\npeople involved, in particular the astronomer Frank Watson Dyson, were not\nbiased in favor of Einstein. It also draws attention to a modern re-analysis of\nthe most important eclipse plates which, though overlooked until now, tends to\nstrongly support the thesis of this paper.\n",

It can predict numerical values of physical quantities to a\nspectacular degree of accuracy. However, from the very early days it has been\nknown that, in QED, there are two important problems which are linked with the\nvery foundation of the theory. In 1952, Dyson put forward strong argumnts to\nsuggest that the perturbation seires in quantum electrodynamics can not be\nconvergent. Just three years latter, in 1955, Landau argued that the effective\nrunning coupling constant in QED has a pole (Landau singularity) albeit at some\nvery high energy scale. This paper addresses, in details, the question of\nstability of perturbative vacuum state of QED in the light of these two well\nknown problems.\n  Landau has been a cult-like figure for many of us who studied theoretical\nphysics in the former Soviet Union. As an undergraduate student in the\ndepartment of theoretical physics of People's Friendship University, Moscow, in\n1970's, I grew up hearing colourful stories about the legendary persona of Lev\nDavidovich from my teachers some of whom had known him at personal level.

We\nbegin considering the sequence of \"technical\" publications that appeared and\nuse it to attempt to identify who were the relativity leaders and authors in\nthe Argentina scientific community of the 1910-1920s. Among them there are\nnatives of Argentina, permanent resident scientists, and occasional foreign\nvisitors. They are either academic scientists, or high school teachers; we\nleave aside the {\\it philosophers} and the {\\it aficionados}. We discuss the\nscientific facts and publications they handled, the modernity of their\ninformation and the \"language\" they use to transmit their ideas. Finally, we\nconsider astronomers proper; first Charles Perrine, an astronomer interested in\nastrophysics, contracted by the government of Argentina in the USA as director\nof its main observatory. He became interested in testing the possible\ndeflection of light rays by the Sun towards 1912; his Argentine expedition was\nthe first to attempt that test. Perhaps Perrine was not so much interested in\nrelativity as in testing the particular astronomical effects it predicted. In\nany case, he attempted the test with the acquiescence and financial support of\nthe Argentine state, and as a leading member of its official scientific elite.\nWe contrast his very specific and strictly scientific efforts with those of our\nsecond astronomer, Jos\\'e Ubach, SJ, a secondary school teacher of science at a\nleading Buenos Aires Catholic school who reported in response to Eddington's\nexpedition. Finally, our third astronomer is F\\'elix Aguilar, who made an\neffort to contribute to the public understanding of Einstein's theories in\n1924, when Einstein's visit to Argentina had become a certainty.

These differences have been\napparent to humankind for millennia, but only brought within the domain of\nscientific understanding since the 1880s.\n  A phase transition is a change from one behavior to another. A first order\nphase transition involves a discontinuous jump in a some statistical variable\nof the system. The discontinuous property is called the order parameter. Each\nphase transitions has its own order parameter that range over a tremendous\nvariety of physical properties. These properties include the density of a\nliquid gas transition, the magnetization in a ferromagnet, the size of a\nconnected cluster in a percolation transition, and a condensate wave function\nin a superfluid or superconductor. A continuous transition occurs when that\njump approaches zero. This note is about statistical mechanics and the\ndevelopment of mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of this\nphenomenon.\n",

The claim that GTR is \"already\nparametrized\" suggests analyzing substantive general covariance as formal\ngeneral covariance achieved without hiding preferred coordinates as scalar\n\"clock fields,\" much as Einstein construed general covariance as the lack of\npreferred coordinates. Physicists often install gauge symmetries artificially\nwith additional fields, as in the transition from Proca's to Stueckelberg's\nelectromagnetism. Some post-positivist philosophers, due to realist sympathies,\nare committed to judging Stueckelberg's electromagnetism distinct from and\ninferior to Proca's. By contrast, physicists identify them, the differences\nbeing gauge-dependent and hence unreal. It is often useful to install gauge\nfreedom in theories with broken gauge symmetries (second-class constraints)\nusing a modified Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) procedure. Massive GTR, for which\nparametrization and a Lagrangian BFT-like procedure appear to coincide, mimics\nGTR's general covariance apart from telltale clock fields. A generalized\nprocedure for installing artificial gauge freedom subsumes parametrization and\nBFT, while being more Lagrangian-friendly than BFT, leaving any primary\nconstraints unchanged and using a non-BFT boundary condition. Artificial gauge\nfreedom licenses a generalized Kretschmann objection. However, features of\nparadigm cases of artificial gauge freedom might help to demonstrate a\nprincipled distinction between substantive and merely formal gauge symmetry.\n",

Because the discharge\nrate increased as the balloon flew at higher altitude, he concluded in 1912\nthat the origin could not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded\nthe Nobel Prize in 1936, and his experiment became legendary.\n  Shortly before, in 1911, Pacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made\na series of measurements to determine the variation in the speed of discharge\nof an electroscope (and thus the intensity of the radiation) while the\nelectroscope was immersed in a box in a sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay\nof Livorno (the Italian Navy supported the research). The measures are\ndocumented in his work \"Penetrating radiation at the surface of and in water\".\nPacini discovered that the discharge of the oscilloscope was significantly\nslower than at the surface.\n  Documents testify that Pacini and Hess knew of each other's work.

The\nperspectives offered by the capture of stars by supermassive black holes are to\nbe cherished, because the study of the motion of falling stars will constitute\na giant step forward in the understanding of gravitation in the regime of\nstrong field. After an account on the perception of free fall in ancient times\nand on the behaviour of a gravitating mass in Newtonian physics, this chapter\ndeals with last century debate on the repulsion for a Schwarzschild black hole\nand mentions the issue of an infalling particle velocity at the horizon.\nFurther, black hole perturbations and numerical methods are presented, paving\nthe way to the introduction of the self-force and other back-action related\nmethods. The impact of the perturbations on the motion of the falling particle\nis computed via the tail, the back-scattered part of the perturbations, or via\na radiative Green function. In the former approach, the self-force acts upon\nthe background geodesic; in the latter, the geodesic is conceived in the total\n(background plus perturbations) field. Regularisation techniques (mode-sum and\nRiemann-Hurwitz $z$ function) intervene to cancel divergencies coming from the\ninfinitesimal size of the particle. An account is given on the state of the\nart, including the last results obtained in this most classical problem,\ntogether with a perspective encompassing future space gravitational wave\ninterferometry and head-on particle physics experiments. As free fall is\npatently non-adiabatic, it requires the most sophisticated techniques for\nstudying the evolution of the motion. In this scenario, the potential of the\nself-consistent approach, by means of which the background geodesic is\ncontinuously corrected by the self-force contribution, is examined.\n",

On the one hand,\nrecent progress of observational cosmology makes think that one has discovered\na new universal constant, perhaps as fundamental as the velocity of light or\nthe Planck's constant, the cosmological constant, which could explain the\nacceleration of the expansion of the universe. On the other hand, just like the\nefforts of Planck and Einstein to reconcile thermodynamics and the\nelectromagnetic theory of light led to the operational beginning of quantum\nphysics, the unexpected discovery of bonds between thermodynamics and general\nrelativity makes to foresee new concepts, perhaps heralding a new scientific\nrevolution, like that of holography and leads to consider a \"thermodynamic\nroute towards quantum cosmology.\" We will discuss the possible implications of\nthese observational and theoretical developments.\n",

We\nalso provide two examples where GA has been found to provide an improved\ndescription of two key physical phenomena, electromagnetism and quantum theory,\nwithout using tensors or complex vector spaces.

Furthermore, the attempt to put it into scientific practice has many\ndamaging consequences for science. The scientific community urgently needs to\nbring about a revolution in both the conception of science, and science itself.\nIt needs to be acknowledged that the actual aims of science make metaphysical,\nvalue and political assumptions and are, as a result, deeply problematic.\nScience needs to try to improve its aims and methods as it proceeds. Standard\nempiricism needs to be rejected, and the more rigorous philosophy of science of\naim-oriented empiricism needs to be adopted and explicitly implemented in\nscientific practice instead.

In\nhis conclusive measurements in June 1911 at the Naval Academy in Livorno, and\nconfirmed in Bracciano a couple of months later, Pacini, proposing a novel\nexperimental technique, observed the radiation strength to decrease when going\nfrom the surface to a few meters underwater (both in the sea and in the lake),\nthus demonstrating that such radiation could not come from the Earth's crust.\nPacini's work was largely overlooked. Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize in\nPhysics in 1936, two years after the death of Pacini, who had become a full\nprofessor of Experimental Physics at the University of Bari. The discovery of\ncosmic rays -a milestone in science- involved several scientists in Europe and\nin the United States of America and took place during a period characterized by\nnationalism and lack of communication. Historical, political and personal\nfacts, embedded in the pre- and post-World War I context, might have\ncontributed to the substantial disappearance of Pacini from the history of\nscience. This article aims to give an unbiased historical account of the\ndiscovery of cosmic rays; in the centenary of Pacini's pioneering experiments,\nhis work, which employed a technique that was complementary to, and independent\nof that of Hess, will be duly taken into consideration. A translation into\nEnglish of three fundamental early articles by Pacini is provided in the\nAppendix.\n",

The first, and main, doctrine is that\nemergence is incompatible with reduction. The second is that emergence is\nsupervenience; or more exactly, supervenience without reduction. In the other\npaper, I develop these rebuttals in general terms, emphasising the second\nrebuttal. Here I discuss the situation in physics, emphasising the first\nrebuttal. I focus on limiting relations between theories and illustrate my\nclaims with four examples, each of them a model or a framework for modelling,\nfrom well-established mathematics or physics. I take emergence as behaviour\nthat is novel and robust relative to some comparison class. I take reduction\nas, essentially, deduction. The main idea of my first rebuttal will be to\nperform the deduction after taking a limit of some parameter. Thus my first\nmain claim will be that in my four examples (and many others), we can deduce a\nnovel and robust behaviour, by taking the limit, N goes to infinity, of a\nparameter N. But on the other hand, this does not show that that the infinite\nlimit is \"physically real\", as some authors have alleged. For my second main\nclaim is that in these same examples, there is a weaker, yet still vivid, novel\nand robust behaviour that occurs before we get to the limit, i.e. for finite N.\nAnd it is this weaker behaviour which is physically real. My examples are: the\nmethod of arbitrary functions (in probability theory); fractals (in geometry);\nsuperselection for infinite systems (in quantum theory); and phase transitions\nfor infinite systems (in statistical mechanics).\n",

But we also relate our definitions to the idea of permutations on the\ndomain of quantification, and their being symmetries. These relations turn out\nto be subtle---some natural conjectures about them are false. We will see in\nparticular that the idea of symmetry meshes with a species of indiscernibility\nthat we will call `absolute indiscernibility'. We then report all the logical\nimplications between our four kinds of discernibility. We use these four kinds\nas a resource for stating four metaphysical theses about identity. Three of\nthese theses articulate two traditional philosophical themes: viz. the\nprinciple of the identity of indiscernibles (which will come in two versions),\nand haecceitism. The fourth is recent. Its most notable feature is that it\nmakes diversity (i.e. non-identity) weaker than what we will call individuality\n(being an individual): two objects can be distinct but not individuals. For\nthis reason, it has been advocated both for quantum particles and for spacetime\npoints. Finally, we locate this fourth metaphysical thesis in a broader\nposition, which we call structuralism. We conclude with a discussion of the\nsemantics suitable for a structuralist, with particular reference to physical\ntheories as well as elementary model theory.\n",

Because relativistic corrections come in at order v^2/c^2 and\nHasenohrl's gedankenexperiment evidently required calculations only to order\nv/c, it is initially puzzling why he did not achieve the answer universally\naccepted today. Moreover, that $m$ should be equal to (4/3)E/c^2 has led\ncommentators to believe that this problem is identical to the famous \"4/3\nproblem\" of the self-energy of the electron and they have invariably attributed\nHasenohrl's mistake to neglect of the cavity stresses. We examine Hasenohrl's\npapers from a modern, relativistic point of view in an attempt to understand\nwhere exactly he went wrong.

In essence, a\ndigression on how could philosophy help cosmologists in what is strictly their\nfundamental endeavor is presented. We start by recalling some examples of\nenduring confrontations among philosophers and physicists on what could be\ncontributed by the formers to the day-time striving of the second ones. Then, a\nshort review of the standard model Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walter (FLRW)\nof cosmology is given. It seems apparent that cosmology is living a golden age\nwith the advent of observations of high precision. Nonetheless, a critical\nrevisiting of the direction in which it should go on appears also needed, for\nmisconcepts like \"quantum backgrounds for cosmological classical settings\" and\n\"quantum gravity unification\" have not been properly constructed up-to-date.\nThus, knowledge-building in cosmology, more than in any other field, should\nbegin with visions of the reality, then taking technical form whenever concepts\nand relations inbetween are translated into a mathematical structure. It is\nmandatory, therefore, that the meaning of such concepts be the same for all\ncosmologists, and that any relationship among all them be tested both logically\nas well as mathematically. In other words, the notorius feature of\nimprobability of our universe, as is well-known, assures to cosmologists a\npriviledged degree of freedom for formulating interpretations and theories.\nHowever, at the same time, it demands for their formulations and conclusions to\nbe considered in the light of data taken from astrophysical observations.\n",

I present here a review of the scientific\nliterature, outlining cases of fine-tuning in the classic works of Carter, Carr\nand Rees, and Barrow and Tipler, as well as more recent work. To sharpen the\ndiscussion, the role of the antagonist will be played by Victor Stenger's\nrecent book The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning: Why the Universe is Not Designed for\nUs. Stenger claims that all known fine-tuning cases can be explained without\nthe need for a multiverse. Many of Stenger's claims will be found to be highly\nproblematic. We will touch on such issues as the logical necessity of the laws\nof nature; objectivity, invariance and symmetry; theoretical physics and\npossible universes; entropy in cosmology; cosmic inflation and initial\nconditions; galaxy formation; the cosmological constant; stars and their\nformation; the properties of elementary particles and their effect on chemistry\nand the macroscopic world; the origin of mass; grand unified theories; and the\ndimensionality of space and time.

We used an astrometric method to\nrecover the original position of the pinhole: reshaping the pinhole to a circle\nof 1.5 cm of diameter, the positions of the Northern and Southern limbs have\nbeen compared with the ephemerides. A sistematic shift of 4.5 mm Southward of\nthe whole solar image shows that the original pinhole was 4.5 mm North of the\nactual position, as the images in the Bianchini's book (1703) suggest. The oval\nshape of the actual pinhole is also wrong. Using a circle the larger solar\nspots are clearly visible. Some reference stars of the catalogue of Philippe de\nla Hire (1702), used originally for measuring the ecliptic latitude of the Sun,\nare written next to the meridian line, but after the last restauration (2000),\nfour of them are wrongly located. Finally the deviation from the true North, of\nthe meridian line's azimuth confirms the value recovered in 1750.

We formulate these two\narguments in such a way that each conclusion follows in first-order logic from\nthe corresponding assumptions. Our analysis shows that the conclusion which\nfollows for Aquinas is considerably weaker than what his aims demand. With\nformalizations that are logically valid in hand, we reinterpret the natural\nlanguage versions of the premises and conclusions in terms of concepts of\ncausality consistent with (and used in) recent work in cosmology done by\nphysicists. In brief: the Kalam argument commits the fallacy of equivocation in\na way that seems beyond repair; two of the premises adopted by Aquinas seem\ndubious when the terms `cause' and `causality' are interpreted in the context\nof contemporary empirical science. Thus, while there are no problems with\nwhether the conclusions follow logically from their assumptions, the Kalam\nargument is not viable, and the Aquinas argument does not imply a caused\norigination of the universe. The assumptions of the latter are at best less\nthan obvious relative to recent work in the sciences. We conclude with mention\nof a new argument that makes some positive modifications to an alternative\nvariation on Aquinas by Le Poidevin, which nonetheless seems rather weak.\n",

Contrary to a widespread but baseless claim, Newton was not the\nprecursor to the idea, and the first Query in his {\\sl Opticks} is totally\nunrelated to this phenomenon. We briefly review the roles of Voltaire, Marat,\nCavendish, Soldner and Einstein in their attempts to quantify the gravitational\ndeflection of light. The first, but unpublished, calculations of the lensing\neffect produced by this deflection are found in Einstein's 1912 notebooks,\nwhere he derived the lensing equation and the formation of images in a\ngravitational lens. The brief 1924 paper by Chwolson which presents, without\ncalculations, the formation of double images and rings by a gravitational lens\npassed mostly unnoticed. The unjustly forgotten and true pioneer of the subject\nis F. Link, who not only published the first detailed lensing calculations in\n1936, nine months prior to Einstein's famous paper in {\\sl Science}, but also\nextended the theory to include the effects of finite-size sources and lenses,\nbinary sources, and limb darkening that same year. Link correctly predicted\nthat the microlensing effect would be easier to observe in crowded fields or in\ngalaxies, as observations confirmed five decades later. The calculations made\nby Link are far more detailed than those by Tikhov and Bogorodsky. We discuss\nbriefly some papers of the early 1960s which marked the renaissance of this\ntheoretical subject prior to the first detection of a gravitational lens in\n1979, and we conclude with the unpublished chapter of Petrou's 1981 PhD thesis\naddressing the microlensing of stars in the Magellanic clouds by dark objects\nin the Galactic halo.\n",

This situation\nraises deep questions about how such theories could relate to the empirical\nrealm, since arguably only entities localized in spacetime can ever be\nobserved. Are such entities even possible in a theory without fundamental\nspacetime? How might they be derived, formally speaking? Moreover, since by\nassumption the fundamental entities can't be smaller than the derived (since\nrelative size is a spatiotemporal notion) and so can't 'compose' them in any\nordinary sense, would a formal derivation actually show the physical reality of\nlocalized entities? We address these questions via a survey of a range of\ntheories of quantum gravity, and generally sketch how they may be answered\npositively.\n",

Nevertheless, being neutral\nparticles they are currently the best \"messengers\" of processes from the\nrelativistic/ultra-relativistic Universe because they can be extrapolated back\nto their origin. The window of VHE gamma rays was opened only in 1989 by the\nWhipple collaboration, reporting the observation of TeV gamma rays from the\nCrab nebula. After a slow start, this new field of research is now rapidly\nexpanding with the discovery of more than 150 VHE gamma-ray emitting sources.\nProgress is intimately related with the steady improvement of detectors and\nrapidly increasing computing power. We give an overview of the early attempts\nbefore and around 1989 and the progress after the pioneering work of the\nWhipple collaboration. The main focus of this article is on the development of\nexperimental techniques for Earth-bound gamma-ray detectors; consequently, more\nemphasis is given to those experiments that made an initial breakthrough rather\nthan to the successors which often had and have a similar (sometimes even\nhigher) scientific output as the pioneering experiments. The considered energy\nthreshold is about 30 GeV. At lower energies, observations can presently only\nbe performed with balloon or satellite-borne detectors. Irrespective of the\nstormy experimental progress, the success story could not have been called a\nsuccess story without a broad scientific output.

To address this problem,\nastronomers of the 17th and18th centuries sought to measure the annual parallax\nof stars using telescopes. None of them succeeded. Annual stellar parallax was\nnot successfully measured until 1838, when Friedrich Bessel detected the\nparallax of the star 61 Cygni. But the early failures to detect annual stellar\nparallax led to the discovery of a new (and entirely unexpected) phenomenon:\nthe aberration of starlight.

Improved star positions progressively opened up and advanced fundamental\nfields of scientific enquiry, including our understanding of the scale of the\nsolar system, the details of the Earth's motion through space, and the\ncomprehension and acceptance of Newtonianism. They also proved crucial to the\npractical task of maritime navigation.

This led to\nquantifying the extravagantly vast scale of the Universe, to a determination of\nthe physical properties of stars, and to the resulting characterisation of the\nstructure, dynamics and origin of our Galaxy.

An analysis of the\nevolution of this concept suggests that the paradigm that was finally settled\ninto prior to that discovery was not the best option, as the observed\nacceleration lends empirical support to an alternative which could incidentally\nexplain expansion in general. I suggest, then, that incomplete reasoning\nregarding the nature of cosmic time in the derivation of the standard model is\nthe reason why the theory cannot coincide with this alternative concept.\nTherefore, through an investigation of the theoretical and empirical facts\nsurrounding the nature of cosmic time, I argue that an enduring\nthree-dimensional cosmic present must necessarily be assumed in relativistic\ncosmology---and in a stricter sense than it has been. Finally, I point to a\nrelated result which could offer a better explanation of the empirically\nconstrained expansion rate.\n",

        "summary": "  In 1904, the year before Einstein's seminal papers on special relativity,\nAustrian physicist Fritz Hasenohrl examined the properties of blackbody\nradiation in a moving cavity. He calculated the work necessary to keep the\ncavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded\nthat the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that E =\n3/8 mc^2. Also in 1904, Hasenohrl achieved the same result by computing the\nforce necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early\n1905, he corrected the latter result to E = 3/4 mc^2. In this paper,\nHasenohrl's papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an\nattempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first\npaper was, ironically, that he didn't account for the loss of mass of the\nblackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking\nthis into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent\nof m = 4/3 E/c^2 or m = 5/3 E/c^2 depending on whether one equates the momentum\nor kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an\nequivalent mass. In his second and third papers that deal with an accelerated\ncavity, Hasenohrl concluded that the mass associated with blackbody radiation\nis m = 4/3 E/c^2, a result which, within the restricted context of Hasenohrl's\ngedanken experiment, is actually consistent with special relativity. Both of\nthese problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to\nbe relevant to the \"4/3 problem\" in classical models of the electron. An\nimportant lesson of these analyses is that E = mc^2, while extremely useful, is\nnot a \"law of physics\" in the sense that it ought not be applied\nindiscriminately to any extended system and, in particular, to the subsystems\nfrom which they are comprised.\n",

The\ncharacteristics of the rows of holes indicate a ritual use, and the\narchaeologists tend to exclude other applications, such as post holes and\ncultivations. The rows have possibly an astronomical orientation, and in the\nsanctuary discovered near Ordona, some stars of the Centaurus-Crux group (may\nbe alpha Centauri itself) could have been used as targets. In past centuries,\nastronomers and scholars have remarked this spectacular region of the sky, and\nits possible relevance for the ancient civilizations was pointed out for\nexample by G.V. Schiaparelli in 1903. In his work on the astronomy in the Old\nTestament, he mentioned in particular the observations of the astronomer W.S.\nJacob and of other scholars.

These remarks are illustrated in terms of the current standard\nmodels of cosmology and particle physics, as well as their respective\nunderlying theories, viz. general relativity and quantum (field) theory. It is\nargued that if history is to be of any guidance, the best chance to obtain the\nkey structural features of a putative quantum gravity theory is by deducing\nthem, in some form, from the appropriate empirical principles (analogous to the\nmanner in which, say, the idea that gravitation is a curved spacetime\nphenomenon is arguably implied by the equivalence principle). It is\nsubsequently argued that the appropriate empirical principles for quantum\ngravity should at least include (i) quantum nonlocality, (ii) irreducible\nindeterminacy, (iii) the thermodynamic arrow of time, (iv) homogeneity and\nisotropy of the observable universe on the largest scales. In each case, it is\nexplained - when appropriate - how the principle in question could be\nimplemented mathematically in a theory of quantum gravity, why it is considered\nto be of fundamental significance and also why contemporary accounts of it are\ninsufficient.\n",

I\nconsider Milgrom's papers of 1983 introducing the idea and its consequences for\ngalaxies and galaxy groups, as well as the initial reactions, both negative and\npositive. The early criticisms were primarily on matters of principle, such as\nthe absence of conservation laws and perceived cosmological problems; an\nimportant step in addressing these issues was the development of the\nLagrangian-based non-relativistic theory of Bekenstein and Milgrom. This theory\nled to the development of a tentative relativistic theory that formed the basis\nfor later multi-field theories of gravity. On an empirical level the predictive\nsuccess of the idea with respect to the phenomenology of galaxies presents\nconsiderable challenges for cold dark matter. For MOND the essential challenge\nremains the absence of a generally accepted theoretical underpinning of the\nidea and, thus, cosmological predictions. I briefly review recent progress in\nthis direction. Finally I discuss the role and sociology of unconventional\nideas in astronomy in the presence of a strongly entrenched standard paradigm.\n",

Attention to the gauge generator G\nof Rosenfeld, Anderson, Bergmann, Castellani et al., a specially tuned sum of\nfirst-class constraints, facilitates seeing that a solitary first-class\nconstraint in fact generates not a gauge transformation, but a bad physical\nchange in electromagnetism (changing E) or GR. The change spoils the Lagrangian\nconstraints in terms of the physically relevant velocities rather than\nauxiliary canonical momenta. While Maudlin has defended change in GR much as G.\nE. Moore resisted skepticism, there remains a need to exhibit the technical\nflaws in the argument.\n  Insistence on Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, a theme emphasized by\nMukunda, Castellani, Sugano, Pons, Salisbury, Shepley and Sundermeyer among\nothers, holds the key. Taking objective change to be ineliminable time\ndependence, there is change in vacuum GR just in case there is no time-like\nvector field satisfying Killing's equation. Throwing away the spatial\ndependence of GR for convenience, one finds that the time evolution from\nHamilton's equations is real change just when there is no time-like Killing\nvector. Hence change is real and local even in the Hamiltonian formalism.\n  The considerations here resolve the Earman-Maudlin standoff: the Hamiltonian\nformalism is helpful, and, suitably reformed, it does not have absurd\nconsequences for change. Hence the classical problem of time is resolved, apart\nfrom the issue of observables, for which the solution is outlined. The quantum\nproblem of time, however, is not automatically resolved due to issues of\nquantum constraint imposition.\n",

I adopt the\nconception of duality as 'isomorphism', cashing it out in terms of three\nconditions. These three conditions prompt two conceptually different ways in\nwhich a duality can be modified to make room for emergence; and I argue that\nthis exhausts the possibilities for combining dualities and emergence (via\ncoarse-graining).\n  I apply this framework to gauge/gravity dualities, considering in detail\nthree examples: AdS/CFT, Verlinde's scheme, and black holes. My main point\nabout gauge/gravity dualities is that the theories involved, qua theories of\ngravity, must be background-independent. I distinguish two senses of\nbackground-independence: (i) minimalistic and (ii) extended. The former is\nsufficiently strong to allow for a consistent theory of quantum gravity; and\nAdS/CFT is background-independent on this account; while Verlinde's scheme best\nfits the extended sense. I argue that this extended sense should be applied\nwith some caution: on pain of throwing the baby (general relativity) out with\nthe bath-water (extended background-independence). Nevertheless, it is an\ninteresting and potentially fruitful heuristic principle for quantum gravity\ntheory construction. The interpretation of dualities is articulated in terms\nof: (i) epistemic and metaphysical commitments; (ii) parts vs. wholes.\n  I then analyse the emergence of gravity in gauge/gravity dualities in terms\nof the two available conceptualisations of emergence; and I show how emergence\nin AdS/CFT and in Verlinde's scenario differ from each other. Finally, I give a\nnovel derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy formula based on\nVerlinde's scheme; the derivation sheds light on several aspects of Verlinde's\nscheme and how it compares to Bekenstein's original calculation.\n",

We establish a map of the countries contributing to GRQC in 2012.\nWe determine the main journals publishing GRQC papers and which countries\npublish in which journals. We find that more and more papers are written by\ngroups (instead of single) of authors with more and more international\ncollaborations. There are huge differences between countries. Hence Russia is\nthe country where most of papers are written by single authors whereas Canada\nis one of the countries where the most of papers imply international\ncollaborations. We also study authors mobility, determining how some groups of\nauthors spread worldwide with time in different countries. The largest\nmobilities are between USA-UK and USA-Germany. Countries attracting the most of\nGRQC authors are Netherlands and Canada whereas those undergoing a brain drain\nare Italy and India. There are few mobility between Europe and Asia contrarily\nto mobility between USA and Asia.\n",

The\nsubsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small\nnumber of quantities, which define a coarse graining. Entropy happens to\ndepends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe\ndepends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low\npast entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate\nof the universe) is non-generic. I argue that for any generic microstate of a\nsufficiently rich system there are always special subsystems defining a coarse\ngraining for which the entropy of the rest is low in one time direction (the\n\"past\"). These are the subsystems allowing creatures that \"live in time\"\n---such as those in the biosphere--- to exist. I reply to some objections\nraised to an earlier presentation of this idea, in particular by Bob Wald,\nDavid Albert and Jim Hartle.\n",

        "summary": "  In extracting predictions from theories that describe a multiverse, we face\nthe difficulty that we must assess probability distributions over possible\nobservations, prescribed not just by an underlying theory, but by a theory\ntogether with a conditionalization scheme that allows for (anthropic) selection\neffects. This means we usually need to compare distributions that are\nconsistent with a broad range of possible observations, with actual\nexperimental data. One controversial means of making this comparison is by\ninvoking the 'principle of mediocrity': that is, the principle that we are\ntypical of the reference class implicit in the conjunction of the theory and\nthe conditionalization scheme. In this paper, I quantitatively assess the\nprinciple of mediocrity in a range of cosmological settings, employing\n'xerographic distributions' to impose a variety of assumptions regarding\ntypicality. I find that for a fixed theory, the assumption that we are typical\ngives rise to higher likelihoods for our observations. If, however, one allows\nboth the underlying theory and the assumption of typicality to vary, then the\nassumption of typicality does not always provide the highest likelihoods.\nInterpreted from a Bayesian perspective, these results support the claim that\nwhen one has the freedom to consider different combinations of theories and\nxerographic distributions (or different 'frameworks'), one should favor the\nframework that has the highest posterior probability; and then from this\nframework one can infer, in particular, how typical we are. In this way, the\ninvocation of the principle of mediocrity is more questionable than has been\nrecently claimed.\n",

The Carrington Event, as it is\nnowadays known by scientists, occurred because of the high solar activity that\nhad visible consequences on Earth, in particular reports of outstanding aurorae\nactivity that amazed thousands of people in the western hemisphere during the\ndawn of September 2. The geomagnetic storm, generated by the solar-terrestrial\nevent, had such a magnitude that the auroral oval expanded towards the equator,\nallowing low latitudes, like Panama's 9$^\\circ$ N, to catch a sight of the\naurorae. An expedition was carried out to review several historical reports and\nbooks from the northern cities of Colombia, allowing the identification of a\nnarrative from Monter\\'ia, Colombia (8$^\\circ$ 45' N), that describes phenomena\nresembling those of an aurorae borealis, such as fire-like lights, blazing and\ndazzling glares, and the appearance of an immense S-like shape in the sky. The\nvery low latitude of the geomagnetic north pole in 1859, the lowest value in\nover half a millennia, is proposed to have allowed the observations of auroral\nevents at locations closer to the equator, and supports the historical\ndescription found in Colombia. The finding of such chronicle represents one of\nthe most complete descriptions of low-latitude sightings of aurorae caused by\nthe Carrington Event.\n",

Knowledge about fundamental particles and\ninteractions, that is, knowledge about the deepest aspects of matter, is\ncertainly high if not top on the priority list, not only for physicists and\nphilosophers. The goal of the present book is to contribute to this knowledge\nby going beyond the usual presentations of quantum field theory in physics\ntextbooks, both in mathematical approach and by critical reflections inspired\nby epistemology, that is, by the branch of philosophy also referred to as the\ntheory of knowledge.\n  Hopefully, the present book motivates physicists to appreciate philosophical\nideas. Epistemology and the philosophy of the evolution of science often seem\nto lag behind science and to describe the developments a posteriori. As\nphilosophy here has a profound influence on the actual shaping of an image of\nfundamental particles and their interactions, our development should stimulate\nthe curiosity and imagination of physicists.\n  This book can be used as a textbook on quantum field theory for students of\nphysics or as a monograph for philosophers and physicists interested in the\nepistemological foundations of particle physics. The benefits of an approach\nresting on philosophical foundations is twofold: the reader is stimulated to\ncritical thinking and the entire story flows very naturally, thus removing all\nthe mysteries from quantum field theory.\n",

Both points are about dualities in string\ntheory, and both have the 'flavour' that two dual theories are 'closer in\ncontent' than you might think. For both points, we adopt a simple conception of\na duality as an 'isomorphism' between theories: more precisely, as appropriate\nbijections between the two theories' sets of states and sets of quantities.\n  The first point (Section 3) is that this conception of duality meshes with\ntwo dual theories being 'gauge related' in the general philosophical sense of\nbeing physically equivalent. For a string duality, such as T-duality and\ngauge/gravity duality, this means taking such features as the radius of a\ncompact dimension, and the dimensionality of spacetime, to be 'gauge'.\n  The second point (Sections 4, 5 and 6) is much more specific. We give a\nresult about gauge/gravity duality that shows its relation to gauge symmetries\n(in the physical sense of symmetry transformations that are\nspacetime-dependent) to be subtler than you might expect. For gauge theories,\nyou might expect that the duality bijections relate only gauge-invariant\nquantities and states, in the sense that gauge symmetries in one theory will be\nunrelated to any symmetries in the other theory. This may be so in general; and\nindeed, it is suggested by discussions of Polchinski and Horowitz. But we show\nthat in gauge/gravity duality, each of a certain class of gauge symmetries in\nthe gravity/bulk theory, viz. diffeomorphisms, is related by the duality to a\nposition-dependent symmetry of the gauge/boundary theory.\n",

        "summary": "  Recent work on the history of General Relativity by Renn, Sauer, Janssen et\nal. shows that Einstein found his field equations partly by a physical strategy\nincluding the Newtonian limit, the electromagnetic analogy, and energy\nconservation. Such themes are similar to those later used by particle\nphysicists. How do Einstein's physical strategy and the particle physics\nderivations compare? What energy-momentum complex(es) did he use and why? Did\nEinstein tie conservation to symmetries, and if so, to which? Einstein used an\nidentity from his assumed linear coordinate covariance x'= Mx to relate it to\nthe canonical tensor. Usually he avoided using matter Euler-Lagrange equations\nand so was not well positioned to use or reinvent the Herglotz-Mie-Born\nunderstanding that the canonical tensor was conserved due to translation\nsymmetries, a result with roots in Lagrange, Hamilton and Jacobi. Whereas Mie\nand Born were concerned about the canonical tensor's asymmetry, Einstein did\nnot need to worry because his Entwurf Lagrangian is modeled not so much on\nMaxwell's theory as on a scalar theory. As a result, it also has 3 ghosts,\nfailing a 1920s-30s a priori particle physics stability test with antecedents\nin Lagrange's and Dirichlet's stability work.\n  This critique of the Entwurf theory can be compared with Einstein's 1915\ncritique of his Entwurf theory for not admitting rotating coordinates and not\ngetting Mercury's perihelion right.\n  Particle physics also can be useful in the historiography of gravity and\nspace-time. This topic can be a useful case study in the history of science on\nrecently reconsidered questions of presentism, whiggism and the like.\n",

        "summary": "  In 1963, Eugene Paul Wigner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his\ncontributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles,\nparticularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry\nprinciples. There are no disputes about this statement. On the other hand,\nthere still is a question of why the statement did not mention Wigner's 1939\npaper on the Lorentz group, which was regarded by Wigner and many others as his\nmost important contribution in physics. By many physicists, this paper was\nregarded as a mathematical exposition having nothing to do with physics.\nHowever, it has been more than one half century since 1963, and it is of\ninterest to see what progress has been made toward understanding physical\nimplications of this paper and its historical role in physics. Wigner in his\n1963 paper defined the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose transformations do\nnot change the four-momentum of a given particle, and he called them the little\ngroups. Thus, Wigner's little groups are for internal space-time symmetries of\nparticles in the Lorentz-covariant world. Indeed, this subgroup can explain the\nelectron spin and spins of other massive particles. However, for massless\nparticles, there was a gap between his little group and electromagnetic waves\nderivable Maxwell's equations. This gap was not completely removed until 1990.\nThe purpose of this report is to review the stormy historical process in which\nthis gap is cleared. It is concluded that Wigner's little groups indeed can be\ncombined into one Lorentz-covariant formula which can dictate the symmetry of\nthe internal space-time time symmetries of massive and massless particles in\nthe Lorentz covariant world, just like Einstein's energy-momentum relation\napplicable to both slow and massless particles.\n",

Noether's 1918 paper developed Hilbert's and\nKlein's reflections on the conservation laws. Energy-momentum is just a term\nproportional to the field equations and a 'curl' term with identically zero\ndivergence. Noether proved a \\emph{converse} \"Hilbertian assertion\": such\n\"improper\" conservation laws imply a generally covariant action.\n  Later and independently, particle physicists derived the nonlinear Einstein\nequations assuming the absence of negative-energy degrees of freedom (\"ghosts\")\nfor stability, along with universal coupling: all energy-momentum including\ngravity's serves as a source for gravity. Those assumptions (all but) imply\n(for 0 graviton mass) that the energy-momentum is only a term proportional to\nthe field equations and a symmetric \"curl,\" which implies the coalescence of\nthe flat background geometry and the gravitational potential into an effective\ncurved geometry. The flat metric, though useful in Rosenfeld's stress-energy\ndefinition, disappears from the field equations. Thus the particle physics\nderivation uses a reinvented Noetherian converse Hilbertian assertion in\nRosenfeld-tinged form.\n  The Rosenfeld stress-energy is identically the canonical stress-energy plus a\nBelinfante curl and terms proportional to the field equations, so the flat\nmetric is only a convenient mathematical trick without ontological commitment.\nNeither generalized relativity of motion, nor the identity of gravity and\ninertia, nor substantive general covariance is assumed. The more compelling\ncriterion of lacking ghosts yields substantive general covariance as an output.\nHence the particle physics derivation, though logically impressive, is neither\nas novel nor as ontologically laden as it has seemed.\n",

Reductionism and\nemergence play an intertwined role in the everyday life of the physicist, yet\nwe rarely stop to contemplate their relationship: indeed, the two are often\nregarded as conflicting world-views of science. I argue that in practice, they\ncompliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by\nthe Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in\nclassical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist\nview of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on\nthe understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was\nunknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not\nunderstand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an\nunderstanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus\nbe likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism. Taking examples from\ncurrent research, including topological insulators and strange metals, I show\nthat the convection between emergence and reductionism continues to provide a\npowerful driver for frontier scientific research, linking the lab with the\ncosmos.\n",

Fontana succeeded in drawing the most accurate maps of\nthe Moon's surface of his time, which were to become popular through a number\nof publications spread all over Europe but without acknowledging the author. At\nthe end of 1645, in a state of declining health and pressed by the need to\ndefend his authorship, Fontana carried out an intense observational campaign,\nwhose results he hurriedly collected in his Novae Coelestium Terrestriumque\nrerum Observationis (1646), the only book he left to posterity. Fontana\nobserved the Moon's main craters, as the crater Tycho which he named Fons\nMajor, their radial patterns and the change in their positions due to the\nMoon's motions. He observed the gibbosity of Mars at quadrature and, together\nwith the Jesuit G.B. Zupus, he described the phases of Mercury. Fontana\nobserved the two - and occasionally three - major bands of Jupiter, and\ninferred the rotation movement of the major planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn,\narguing that they could not be attached to an Aristotelian sky. He came close\nto revealing the ring structure of Saturn. He also suggested the presence of\nadditional moons around Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, which prompted a debate that\nlasted more than a hundred years. In several places of his book Fontana\nrepeatedly claimed to have conceived the first positive eyepiece in 1608,\nproviding a declaration by Zupus to have used his telescope since 1614. This\ndeclaration is still the oldest record mentioning such a device. We finally\nsuggest that the telescopes depicted in the two Allegory of Sight by J.\nBrueghel the Elder belonging to Albert VII might have been made by Fontana, and\nthat he might have inspired the Sight by Jusepe Ribera (c. 1616).\n",

For about two centuries, some versions of tetrahedron argument and a\nfew other proofs of the existence of stress tensor are presented in every text\non continuum mechanics, fluid mechanics, and the relevant subjects. In this\narticle, we show the birth, importance, and location of these Cauchy's\nachievements, then by presenting the formal tetrahedron argument in detail, for\nthe first time, we extract some fundamental challenges. These conceptual\nchallenges are related to the result of applying the conservation of linear\nmomentum to any mass element, the order of magnitude of the surface and volume\nterms, the definition of traction vectors on the surfaces that pass through the\nsame point, the approximate processes in the derivation of stress tensor, and\nsome others. In a comprehensive review, we present the different tetrahedron\narguments and the proofs of the existence of stress tensor, discuss the\nchallenges in each one, and classify them in two general approaches. In the\nfirst approach that is followed in most texts, the traction vectors do not\nexactly define on the surfaces that pass through the same point, so most of the\nchallenges hold. But in the second approach, the traction vectors are defined\non the surfaces that pass exactly through the same point, therefore some of the\nrelevant challenges are removed. We also study the improved works of Hamel and\nBackus, and indicate that the original work of Backus removes most of the\nchallenges. This article shows that the foundation of continuum mechanics is\nnot a finished subject and there are still some fundamental challenges.\n",

These bounds constrain the possible properties of\nany universe that contains agents who can acquire information concerning that\nuniverse.\n  I then extend this previous work on IDs, by adding to the definition of IDs\nsome of the other mathematical structure that is common to the four ways of\nacquiring information about the universe but is not captured in the (minimal)\ndefinition of IDs.

First introduced to the general theory of relativity by\nEinstein in 1917 in order to describe a universe that was assumed to be static,\nthe term fell from favour in the wake of the discovery of the expanding\nuniverse, only to make a dramatic return in recent times. We consider\nhistorical and philosophical aspects of the cosmological constant over four\nmain epochs: (i) the use of the term in static cosmologies (both Newtonian and\nrelativistic); (ii) the marginalization of the term following the discovery of\ncosmic expansion; (iii) the use of the term to address specific cosmic puzzles\nsuch as the timespan of expansion, the formation of galaxies and the redshifts\nof the quasars; (iv) the re-emergence of the term in today's Lamda-CDM\ncosmology. We find that the cosmological constant was never truly banished from\ntheoretical models of the universe, but was sidelined by astronomers for\nreasons of convenience. We also find that the return of the term to the\nforefront of modern cosmology did not occur as an abrupt paradigm shift due to\none particular set of observations, but as the result of a number of empirical\nadvances such as the measurement of present cosmic expansion using the Hubble\nSpace Telescope, the measurement of past expansion using type SN 1a supernovae\nas standard candles, and the measurement of perturbations in the cosmic\nmicrowave background by balloon and satellite. We give a brief overview of\ncontemporary interpretations of the physics underlying the cosmic constant and\nconclude with a synopsis of the famous cosmological constant problem.\n",

In this work, we show how this two-fold\nrole of observables constitutes a key feature in the conceptual analysis of\nclassical and quantum kinematics, shedding a new light on the distinguishing\nfeature of the quantum at the kinematical level. We first take a look at the\nalgebraic description of both classical and quantum observables in terms of\nJordan-Lie algebras and show how the two algebraic structures are the precise\nmathematical manifestation of the two-fold role of observables. Then, we turn\nto the geometric reformulation of quantum kinematics in terms of K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds. A key achievement of this reformulation is to show that the two-fold\nrole of observables is the constitutive ingredient defining what an observable\nis. Moreover, it points to the fact that, from the restricted point of view of\nthe transformational role of observables, classical and quantum kinematics\nbehave in exactly the same way. Finally, we present Landsman's general\nframework of Poisson spaces with transition probability, which highlights with\nunmatched clarity that the crucial difference between the two kinematics lies\nin the way the two roles of observables are related to each other.\n",

First, we distinguish between microstructure inspired from GR, such\nas through quantization or discretization, and microstructure that is not\ndirectly motivated from GR, such as strings, quantum bits or condensed matter\nfields. The emergent gravity approach can then be defined as the view that the\nmetric field and its dynamics are derivable from the latter type of\nmicrostructure. Subsequently, we assess in how far the following properties of\n(semi-classical) GR are suggestive of underlying microstructure: (1) the\nmetric's universal coupling to matter fields, (2) perturbative\nnon-renormalizability, (3) black hole thermodynamics, and (4) the holographic\nprinciple.

The essence of the Sixth Problem is discussed and\nthe content of this issue is introduced.\n  In 1900, David Hilbert presented 23 problems for the advancement of\nmathematical science. Hilbert's Sixth Problem proposed the expansion of the\naxiomatic method outside of mathematics, in physics and beyond. Its title was\nshocking: \"Mathematical Treatment of the Axioms of Physics.\" Axioms of physics\ndid not exist and were not expected. During further explanation, Hilbert\nspecified this problem with special focus on probability and \"the limiting\nprocesses, ... which lead from the atomistic view to the laws of motion of\ncontinua\". The programmatic call was formulated \"to treat, by means of axioms,\nthose physical sciences in which already today mathematics plays an important\npart.\" This issue presents a modern slice of the work on the Sixth Problem,\nfrom quantum probability to fluid dynamics and machine learning, and from\nreview of solid mathematical and physical results to opinion pieces with new\nambitious ideas. Some expectations were broken: The continuum limit of\natomistic kinetics may differ from the classical fluid dynamics. The \"curse of\ndimensionality\" in machine learning turns into the \"blessing of dimensionality\"\nthat is closely related to statistical physics. Quantum probability facilitates\nthe modelling of geological uncertainty and hydrocarbon reservoirs. And many\nother findings are presented.\n",

The almost one hundred\nwritings by Einstein, of which a third have never been published, and the more\nthan thirteen hundred letters show Einstein's immense productivity and hectic\npace of life.\n  Einstein quickly grasps the conceptual peculiarities involved in the new\nquantum mechanics, such as the difference between Schr\\\"odinger's wave function\nand a field defined in spacetime, or the emerging statistical interpretation of\nboth matrix and wave mechanics. Inspired by correspondence with G. Y. Rainich,\nhe investigates with Jakob Grommer the problem of motion in general relativity,\nhoping for a hint at a new avenue to unified field theory.\n  Einstein falls victim to scientific fraud when, in a collaboration with E.\nRupp, he becomes convinced that the latter's experiments, aimed at deciding\nwhether excited atoms emit light instantaneously (in quanta) or in a finite\ntime (in waves), confirm a wave-theoretic explanation.\n  While it was known that the teenage Einstein had been romantically involved\nwith Marie Winteler in 1895, newly discovered documents reveal that his love\nfor Marie was rekindled in 1909-10 while he was still married to Mileva\nMari\\'c.\n  The 1925 Locarno Treaties renew Einstein's optimism in European\nreconciliation.

First, particle physics deflects Schlick's\nGeneral Relativity-based critique of synthetic a priori knowledge. Schlick\nargued that since geometry was not synthetic a priori, nothing was---a key step\ntoward logical empiricism. Particle physics suggests a Kant-friendlier theory\nof space-time and gravity presumably approximating General Relativity\narbitrarily well, massive spin-2 gravity, while retaining a flat space-time\ngeometry that is_indirectly_ observable at large distances. The theory's roots\ninclude Seeliger and Neumann in the 1890s and Einstein in 1917 as well as\n1920s-30s physics. Such theories have seen renewed scientific attention since\n2000 and especially since 2010 due to breakthroughs addressing early 1970s\ntechnical difficulties. Second, particle physics casts additional doubt on\nFriedman's constitutive \\emph{a priori} role for the principle of equivalence.\nMassive spin-2 gravity presumably should have nearly the same empirical content\nas General Relativity while differing radically on foundational issues.\nEmpirical content even in General Relativity resides in partial differential\nequations, not in an additional principle identifying gravity and inertia.\nThird, Kant's apparent claim that Newton's results could be known a priori is\nundermined by an alternate gravitational equation. The modified theory has a\nsmaller (Galilean) symmetry group than does Newton's. What Kant wanted from\nNewton's gravity is impossible due its large symmetry group, but is closer to\nachievable given the alternative theory.\n",

Indeed, he is reputed to have labelled the term, originally\nintroduced to the field equations of general relativity in 1917 in order to\npredict a static universe, his \"biggest blunder\". However serious doubts about\nthis reported statement have been raised in recent years. In this paper, we\ninterrogate the legend of Einstein's \"biggest blunder\" statement in the context\nof our recent studies of Einstein's cosmology in his later years. We find that\nthe remark is highly compatible with Einstein's cosmic models of the 1930s,\nwith his later writings on cosmology, and with independent reports by at least\nthree physicists. We conclude that there is little doubt that Einstein came to\nview the introduction of the cosmological constant term a serious error and\nthat it is very likely that he labelled the term his \"biggest blunder\" on at\nleast one occasion. This finding may be of some relevance for those\ntheoreticians today who seek to describe the recently-discovered acceleration\nin cosmic expansion without the use of a cosmological constant term.\n",

The remark is that in physics, two theories can be dual, and\naccordingly get called `the same theory', though we interpret them as\ndisagreeing---so that they are certainly not equivalent, as `equivalent' is\nnormally understood. So the remark is simple: but, I shall argue, worth\nstressing---since often neglected. My argument for this is based on the account\nof duality developed by De Haro: which is illustrated here with several\nexamples, from both elementary physics and string theory. Thus I argue that in\nsome examples, including in string theory, two dual theories disagree in their\nclaims about the world. I also spell out how this remark implies a limitation\nof proposals (both traditional and recent) to understand theoretical\nequivalence as either logical equivalence or a weakening of it.\n",

This result has excited the usual healthy skepticism, with questions\nabout whether any untrained peoples can discover the variability and whether\nsuch a discovery is likely to be placed into lore and transmitted for long\nperiods of time. Here, I am offering an independent evaluation, based on broad\nexperience with naked-eye sky viewing and astro-history. I find that it is easy\nfor inexperienced observers to detect the variability of Betelgeuse over its\nrange in brightness from V = 0.0 to V = 1.3, for example in noticing from\nseason-to-season that the star varies from significantly brighter than Procyon\nto being greatly fainter than Procyon. Further, indigenous peoples in the\nSouthern Hemisphere inevitably kept watch on the prominent red star, so it is\ninevitable that the variability of Betelgeuse was discovered many times over\nduring the last 65 millennia. The processes of placing this discovery into a\ncultural context (in this case, put into morality stories) and the faithful\ntransmission for many millennia is confidently known for the Aboriginal\nAustralians in particular. So this shows that the whole claim for a changing\nBetelgeuse in the Aboriginal Australian lore is both plausible and likely.\nGiven that the discovery and transmission is easily possible, the real proof is\nthat the Aboriginal lore gives an unambiguous statement that these stars do\nindeed vary in brightness, as collected by many ethnographers over a century\nago from many Aboriginal groups. So I strongly conclude that the Aboriginal\nAustralians could and did discover the variability of Betelgeuse, Aldebaran,\nand Antares.\n",

XYCM is then\nanalyzed from a statistical perspective, where it is argued that a finetuned\npoint in the parameter space is not abnormal, with any such point being just as\nprobable as any other point. However, landing inside a standardly defined\nfinetuned region (i.e., the full parameter space of finetuned points) has a\nmuch lower probability than landing outside the region, and that probability is\ninvariant under assumed ranges of parameters. This proposition requires\nasserting also that the finetuned target region is a priori established.\nTherefore, it is surmised that highly finetuned theories are generally expected\nto be highly improbable. An actionable implication of this moderate naturalness\nposition is that the search for a non-finetuned explanation to supplant an\napparently finetuned theory is likely to be a valid pursuit, but not guaranteed\nto be. A statistical characterization of this moderate position is presented,\nas well as those of the extreme pro-naturalness and anti-naturalness positions.\n",

By arguing that a fundamental description of\nthe Universe should possess zero entropy, we develop a 'holistic' concept for\nthe most fundamental layer of reality: The fundamental description of the\nUniverse is the Universe itself, understood as an entangled quantum state.\nAdopting a universal applicability of quantum mechanics, in this framework the\nbehavior of subsystems can be understood as the perspectival experience of an\nentangled quantum Universe perceived through the \"lens of decoherence\". In this\npicture the fundamental reality is non-local, and finetuned coincidences in\neffective theories may be understood in a way similar to EPR-correlations. This\nnotion provides a fresh view on the topic of Naturalness and Finetuning since\nit suggests that Finetuning problems and hints for anthropic explanations are\nan artefact of theories building up on subsystems rather than on the\nfundamental description. Recent work in quantum gravity aiming at an\nunderstanding of spacetime geometry from entanglement entropy could be\ninterpreted as a first sign of such a paradigm shift.\n",

        "summary": "  In most introductory courses on electrodynamics, one is taught the electric\ncharge is quantised but no theoretical explanation related to this law of\nnature is offered. Such an explanation is postponed to graduate courses on\nelectrodynamics, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, where the famous\nDirac quantisation condition is introduced, which states that a single magnetic\nmonopole in the Universe would explain the electric charge quantisation. Even\nwhen this condition assumes the existence of a not-yet-detected magnetic\nmonopole, it provides the most accepted explanation for the observed\nquantisation of the electric charge. However, the usual derivation of the Dirac\nquantisation condition involves the subtle concept of an \"unobservable\"\nsemi-infinite magnetised line, the so-called \"Dirac string,\" which may be\ndifficult to grasp in a first view of the subject. The purpose of this review\nis to survey the concepts underlying the Dirac quantisation condition, in a way\nthat may be accessible to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Some of\nthe discussed concepts are gauge invariance, singular potentials,\nsingle-valuedness of the wave function, undetectability of the Dirac string and\nquantisation of the electromagnetic angular momentum. Five quantum-mechanical\nand three semi-classical derivations of the Dirac quantisation condition are\nreviewed. In addition, a simple derivation of this condition involving\nheuristic and formal arguments is presented.\n",

But does some of the renaissance progress in\nunderstanding and justifying Einstein's equations owe something to particle\nphysics egalitarianism? If so, how should the historiography of gravitation and\nEinstein's equations reflect that fact?\n  The idea of a graviton mass has a 19th century Newtonian pre-history in\nNeumann's and Seeliger's long-distance modification of gravity, which\n(especially for Neumann) altered Poisson's equation to give a potential\n$e^{-mr}/r$ for a point mass, improving convergence for homogeneous matter.\nEinstein reinvented the idea before introducing his faulty analogy with\n$\\Lambda$.

The error is difficult\nto catch if one has an aversion to perturbative thinking, but difficult to make\nif one thinks along the lines of particle physics. The $\\Lambda$-graviton mass\nconfusion not only distorted the interpretation of Einstein's theory, but also\nobscured a potentially serious particle physics-motivated rivalry (massless vs.\nmassive spin 2).

The present paper brings attention to the\nunderlying and often uncritically accepted assumptions in these cases.

This, of course, does not mean\nthat we are atypical in time; instead, the notion of typicality in time is\nnecessarily somewhat vague and restricted.

Good beliefs are scarce, so\ndon't change without reason. But does conservatism prevent conceptual\ninnovation? No: considering all serious possibilities (Feynman, Weinberg, etc.)\ncould lead to Einstein's equations. (The rehabilitation of massive gravity\nshows that 'progress' isn't unidirectional.)

Hamiltonian change\nresults from Lagrangian-equivalence. Causality poses conceptual questions. For\nGR, what are canonical 'equal-time' commutators?

An example is the\nemergent phenomenon of bound nuclei, whose constituents are neutrons and\nprotons, which in turn are themselves composed of more fundamental particles\ncalled quarks and gluons. In going from a fundamental description that utilizes\nquarks and gluons to an effective field theory description of nuclei, the\nlength scales traversed span at least two orders of magnitude. In this article\nwe provide an Effective Field Theory viewpoint on the topic of emergence,\narguing on the side of reductionism and weak emergence.

These include a dislike of\npoint-like elementary particles, which he blamed for infinite renormalization,\nand a preference for extended objects distinguished by what we would now call\ntopological quantum numbers. In this he was strongly influenced by William\nThomson (Lord Kelvin), who was so impressed by Helmholtz's proof of the\nconservation of circulation (\"Wirbelbewegung\") in fluid vortices that he\ndeveloped an entire theory of atoms as knotted vortices in the ether fluid.\nSkyrme liked mechanical models, as did Kelvin, and he grew up fascinated by the\ningenuity of Kelvin's machine for predicting tides, an example of which stood\nin his grandfather's house. This seems to have been connected to his strong\npreference for bosonic fields, which have a classical limit, over fermionic\nfields which do not. I then sketch the progress of Skyrme's ideas in the series\nof six papers in the years 1958-62, which passed largely unnoticed at the time.\nI emphasize his remarkable intuition that the kink solution of the classical\nSine-Gordon equation would be a fermion when quantized, and the novelty of his\nidentification of the Skyrmion winding number with baryon number in the\nthree-dimensional case. I end by briefly describing how Skyrme's work was\ndramatically related to QCD in 1983-4.\n",

Black holes were predicted to emit thermal\nradiation, what is now called Hawking radiation. He pioneered the study of\nprimordial black holes and their potential role in cosmology. His organisation\nof and contributions to the Nuffield Workshop in 1982 consolidated the picture\nthat the large-scale structure of the universe originated as quantum\nfluctuations during the inflationary era. Work on the interplay between quantum\nmechanics and general relativity resulted in his formulation of the concept of\nthe wavefunction of the universe. The tension between quantum mechanics and\ngeneral relativity led to his struggles with the information paradox concerning\ndeep connections between these fundamental areas of physics.\n  These achievements were all accomplished following the diagnosis during the\nearly years of Stephen's studies as a post-graduate student in Cambridge that\nhe had incurable motor neuron disease -- he was given two years to live.\nAgainst all the odds, he lived a further 55 years. The distinction of his work\nled to many honours and he became a major public figure, promoting with passion\nthe needs of disabled people. His popular best-selling book A Brief History of\nTime made cosmology and his own work known to the general public worldwide. He\nbecame an icon for science and an inspiration to all.\n",

It\nis an urban system in a grid, outlined by straight streets that form squares,\nits layout being the first case of an unfortified colonial city with a regular\nplan in the overseas European expansion. It constitutes a historical example of\nthe so-called \"Town of Peace\", the archetype of a city-republic in a new land\nthat employed its own natural boundaries to delimit and defend itself. Founded\nin 1496, the historical centre of the old city was declared a World Heritage\nSite by UNESCO in 1999. We analyse the exact spatial orientation of twenty-one\nhistoric Christian churches currently existing in the old part of La Laguna\nwhich we take as a good indicator of the original layout of the urban lattice.\nWe find a clear orientation pattern that, if correlated with the rising or\nsetting Sun, singles out an absolute-value astronomical declination slightly\nbelow 20 degrees, which, within the margin of error of our study, might be\nassociated with the July 25th feast-day of San Cristobal de Licia, the saint to\nwhom the town was originally dedicated.

This paper answers this\nquestion in the negative by indicating that general relativity is multiply\nrealizable in quantum gravity. The argument is inspired by spacetime\nfunctionalism - multiple realizability being a central tenet of functionalism -\nand proceeds via three case studies: induced gravity, thermodynamic gravity,\nand entanglement gravity. In these, general relativity in the form of the\nEinstein field equations can be recovered from elements that are either\nmanifestly multiply realizable or at least of the generic nature that is\nsuggestive of functions. If general relativity, as argued here, can inherit\nthis multiple realizability, then a theory of quantum gravity can recover\ngeneral relativity while being completely wrong about the posited\nmicrostructure. As a consequence, the recovery of general relativity cannot\nserve as the ultimate arbiter that decides which theory of quantum gravity that\nis worthy of pursuit, even though it is of course not irrelevant either qua\nquantum gravity. Thus, the recovery of general relativity in string theory, for\ninstance, does not guarantee that the stringy account of the world is on the\nright track; despite sentiments to the contrary among string theorists.\n",

Furthermore,\nit would not be even enough to be able to compute those methods and obtain\npredictions. There are cases where underdeterminacy might be unavoidable, such\nas the interpretation of quantum mechanics or the current status of string\ntheory.

The result of all these\nstudies are the following: i) although the data of Ptolemy and Hipparchus are\nundoubtedly correlated, it is certainly also wrong to accuse Ptolemy having\nsimply copied and transformed it without correct citation; ii) although\nHipparchus presumably observed most of his star catalogue with his own\ninstruments, we cannot neglect Babylonian influences. Hipparchus was educated\nin Greek astronomy but, in his time, there are traces of Babylonian influences\nsince at least two centuries. Since we are unable to definitely prove that\nHipparchus used Babylonian data, we are not sure if there are direct Babylonian\ninfluences in his time or as a consequence of his education only.

Three data sets were\nobtained: two showed the measured deflection matched the theoretical prediction\nof Einstein's 1915 Theory of General Relativity, and became the official\nresult; the third was discarded as defective. At the time, the experimental\nresult was accepted by the expert astronomical community. However, in 1980 a\nstudy by philosophers of science Earman and Glymour claimed that the data\nselection in the 1919 analysis was flawed and that the discarded data set was\nfully valid and was not consistent with the Einstein prediction, and that,\ntherefore, the overall result did not verify General Relativity. This claim,\nand the resulting accusation of Eddington's bias, was repeated with\nexaggeration in later literature, and has become ubiquitous. The 1919 and 1980\nanalyses of the same data provide two discordant conclusions. We reanalyse the\n1919 data, and identify the error that undermines the conclusions of Earman and\nGlymour.\n",

This development is located as\noriginating in the 1930s and 40s, primarily in the attempts by Werner\nHeisenberg and Richard Feynman to find a new theory of relativistic quantum\nmechanics that gets rid of the notion of state entirely. It is then shown how\nthese attempts formed the conceptual inspiration and the provided the formal\ntools for the formulation of modern, scattering-based QFT in the late 1940s, in\nparticular by Freeman Dyson (and, to some extent, by E.C.G. Stueckelberg). This\ntransformation of quantum field theory is interpreted as a paradigm shift in a\nweak sense, where the foundations of the theory remain the same, while the\nparadigmatic problem to be calculated changes (in this case from energy levels\nto scattering amplitudes).\n",

We reassess the date of Eirene's death,\nwhich has been variously dated between late 1239 and 1241, with the\nunderstanding that narrowing the range in which this event occurred contributes\nmuch to understanding the political situation in the area around 1240. George\nAkropolites, a famous official of the Empire, gives an account that connects\nEirene's death to a comet that appeared \"six months earlier\", thus pointing to\ntwo comet candidates that were visible from the Eastern Mediterranean between\n1239 and 1241, one recorded on \"3 June 1239\" and the other on \"31 January\n1240\". Recent historians prefer the former, based on historical circumstances\nand without a critical assessment of the comet records. We revisit the\nhistorical records and reveal that the \"3 June 1239\" candidate was not a comet.\nOn the other hand, the other candidate, sighted on \"31 January 1240\", was a\ncomet, as supported by multiple historical records in multiple regions, and is\nalso a good fit with Akropolites's narrative. Therefore, we conclude that\nEirene died six months after the comet that was seen on 31 January 1240, which\nplaces her death in the summer of 1240. Given that the date of her death is\ncrucial for determining some other contemporary events across the Eastern\nMediterranean, our results offer a solid basis for further research on the\nthirteenth-century Eastern Mediterranean.\n",

At\nthis juncture, Australia's Commonwealth Solar Observatory expanded its\nportfolio from primarily studying solar phenomena to conducting stellar and\nextragalactic research. Subsequently, in the 1950s and 1960s, astronomy\ngradually became taught and researched in Australian universities. However,\nmost scientific publications from this era of growth and discovery have no\ncountry of affiliation in their header information, making it hard to find the\nAustralian astronomy articles from this period. In 2014, we used the then-new\nAstrophysics Data System (ADS) tool Bumblebee to overcome this challenge and\ntrack down the Australian-led astronomy papers published during the quarter of\na century after World War II, from 1945 until the lunar landing in 1969. This\nrequired knowledge of the research centres and facilities operating at the\ntime, which are briefly summarised herein. Based on citation counts -- an\nobjective, universally-used measure of scientific impact -- we report on the\nAustralian astronomy articles which had the biggest impact. We have identified\nthe top-ten most-cited papers, and thus also their area of research, from five\nconsecutive time-intervals across that blossoming quarter-century of astronomy.\nMoreover, we have invested a substantial amount of time researching and\nproviding a small tribute to each of the 62 scientists involved, including\nseveral trail-blazing women.

Recent successes of inductive metaphysics, which studies the\nimplications of the natural sciences for metaphysical problems, suggest that\ninsights into the SCQ can be gained by investigating the physics of composite\nsystems. In this work, I show that the minus first law of thermodynamics, which\nis concerned with the approach to equilibrium, leads to a new approach to the\nSCQ, the thermodynamic composition principle (TCP): Multiple systems in\n(generalized) thermal contact compose a single system. This principle, which is\njustified based on a systematic classification of possible mereological models\nfor thermodynamic systems, can form the basis of an inductive argument for\nuniversalism. A formal analysis of the TCP is provided on the basis of\nmereotopology, which is a combination of mereology and topology. Here, \"thermal\ncontact\" can be analyzed using the mereotopological predicate\n\"self-connectedness\". Self-connectedness has to be defined in terms of\nmereological sums to ensure that scattered objects cannot be self-connected.\n",

In the\nthird paper in the series I will provide yet a third desideratum, to deal with\nan issue that goes beyond the standard debate about sophistication.\n",

In the case of electromagnetism, this enables us to\npair degrees of freedom of the electric field with degrees of freedom of the\nvector potential. Another benefit is that the formalism algorithmically\nidentifies subsets of the equations of motion that represent time-dependent\nsymmetries. For electromagnetism, these two benefits allow us to define\ngauge-fixing in parallel to special decompositions of the electric field. More\nspecifically, we apply the Helmholtz decomposition theorem to split the\nelectric field into its Coulombic and radiative parts, and show how this gives\na special role to the Coulomb gauge (i.e. div$({\\bf A}) = 0$).

So my overarching main question is: can DES be associated to\nthe local gauge symmetries, acting solely on subsystems? In local gauge\ntheories, any quantity with physical significance must be a gauge-invariant\nquantity. To attack the question of DES from this gauge-invariant angle, we\nrequire a split of the state into its physical and its representational\ncontent: a split that is relative to a representational convention, or a\ngauge-fixing. Using this method, we propose a rigorous definition of DES, valid\nfor any state. This definition fills the gaps in influential previous\nconstruals of DES.

Feynman's arguments in favor of the\nquantization of the gravitational field, based essentially on a series of\ngedanken experiments, are here discussed.

In this respect, Feynman's many-worlds\ncharacterization of Everett's approach at Chapel Hill is discussed, together\nwith later contributions of his, including a kind of Schr\\\"{o}dinger's cat\nparadox, which are scattered throughout the 1962-63 Lectures on Gravitation.\nPhilosophical implications of Feynman's ideas in relation to foundational\nissues are also discussed.\n",

If space-time has\nenergy-momentum, then space-time is substantival. Two extant ways to avoid the\nsubstantivalist conclusion deny that the energy-bearing metric is part of\nspace-time or deny that gravitational energy exists. Feynman linked doubts\nabout gravitational energy to GR-exceptionalism; particle physics\negalitarianism encourages realism about gravitational energy.\n  This essay proposes a third view, involving a particle physics-inspired\nnon-perturbative split that characterizes space-time with a constant background\n_matrix_ (not a metric), avoiding the inference from gravitational energy to\nsubstantivalism: space-time is (M, eta), where eta=diag(-1,1,1,1) is a\nspatio-temporally constant numerical signature matrix (already used in GR with\nspinors). The gravitational potential, bearing any gravitational energy, is\ng_(munu)(x)-eta (up to field redefinitions), an _affine_ geometric object with\na tensorial Lie derivative and a vanishing covariant derivative. This\nnon-perturbative split permits strong fields, arbitrary coordinates, and\narbitrary topology, and hence is pure GR by almost any standard. This\nrazor-thin background, unlike more familiar ones, involves no extra gauge\nfreedom and so lacks their obscurities and carpet lump-moving.\n  After a discussion of Curiel's GR exceptionalist rejection of energy\nconservation, the two traditional objections to pseudotensors, coordinate\ndependence and nonuniqueness, are explored. Both objections are inconclusive\nand getting weaker. A literal interpretation of Noether's theorem (infinitely\nmany energies) largely answers Schroedinger's false-negative coordinate\ndependence problem. Bauer's nonuniqueness (false positive) objection has\nseveral answers.\n",

Our\naim is to investigate how relaxation oscillations were actually discovered.\nBrowsing the literature from the late 19th century, we identified four\nself-oscillating systems in which relaxation oscillations have been observed:\ni) the series dynamo machine conducted by G\\'erard-Lescuyer (1880), ii) the\nmusical arc discovered by Duddell (1901) and investigated by Blondel (1905),\niii) the triode invented by de Forest (1907) and, iv) the multivibrator\nelaborated by Abraham and Bloch (1917).

In his Einstein biography,\nAbraham Pais asserted that he could not understand the reasons that pushed\nEinstein to communicate his work. Indeed, Einstein's paper seems to be very\nclose to Oskar Klein's approach, published in 1926. The question seems to be\nyet unanswered, also in recent works. We analysed the differences between\nEinstein's and Klein's work and we propose a new interpretation of Einstein's\napproach. In 1927, he tried to use Weyl's scale invariance in order to\nconstruct a theory covering macroscopic as well as microscopic phenomena. In\nconstructing a five-dimensional action, Einstein used in a modern way the idea\nof ``gauge invariance''. Furthermore, we propose an additional motivation for\nthe fact that he did not mention Klein's and Vladimir Fock's contributions in\nhis first communication and we show further evidences which would confirm also\nPaul Halpern's recent proposal. As a consequence of our interpretation of the\nrole of conformal transformations, we suggest that in 1927 Einstein did not\nconsider the fifth dimension as real and that his approach, unlike Klein's\nattempt, cannot be considered inconsistent.\n",

His approach to this aspect of general relativity\ndiffered sharply from another set forth by Hilbert, even though the latter\nconjectured in 1916 that both theories were probably equivalent. Rather than\npursue this question himself, Hilbert chose to charge Emmy Noether with the\ntask of probing the mathematical foundations of these two theories. Indirect\nreferences to her results came out two years later when Klein began to examine\nthis question again with Noether's assistance. Over several months, Klein and\nEinstein pursued these matters in a lengthy correspondence, which culminated\nwith several publications, including Noether's now famous paper \"Invariante\nVariationsprobleme\". The present account focuses on the earlier discussions\nfrom 1916 involving Einstein, Hilbert, and Noether. In these years, a Swiss\nstudent named R.J. Humm was studying relativity in G\\\"ottingen, during which\ntime he transcribed part of Noether's lost manuscript on Hilbert's invariant\nenergy vector. By making use of this 9-page manuscript, it is possible to\nreconstruct the arguments Noether set forth in response to Hilbert's\nconjecture. Her results turn out to be closely related to the findings Klein\npublished two years later, thereby highlighting, once again, how her work\nsignificantly deepened contemporary understanding of the mathematical\nunderpinnings of general relativity.\n",

The most important are Einstein, Dyson, Eddington, the Sun, the\nMoon, Sobral, and Principe. Einstein's theory of gravitation, general\nrelativity, had the prediction that the gravitational field of the Sun deflects\nan incoming light ray from a background star on its way to Earth. The\ncalculation gave that the shift in the star's position was 1.75 arcseconds for\nlight rays passing at the Sun's rim. So to test it definitely it was necessary\nto be in the right places on May 29, 1919, the day of the eclipse. That indeed\nhappened, with a Royal Greenwich Observatory team composed of Crommelin and\nDavidson that went to Sobral, and that was led at a distance by the Astronomer\nRoyal Frank Dyson, and with Eddington of Cambridge University that went to\nPrincipe with his assistant Cottingham. The adventure is fascinating, from the\npreparations, to the day of the eclipse, the data analysis, the results, and\nthe history that has been made. It confirmed general relativity, and marked an\nepoch that helped in delineating science in the post eclipse era up to now and\ninto the future.

A thorough exegesis of von Neumann's cyclical gas\ntransformation is put forth, along with a reconstruction of two additional\nthought experiments from the text. This closer look reveals that von Neumann's\ngoal is not to establish a link between $S_{VN}$ and $S_{TD}$, as is assumed\nthroughout the current debate, but rather to establish a correspondence between\n$S_{VN}$ and the Gibbs statistical mechanical entropy $S_{G}$. On these grounds\nI argue that the existing literature misunderstands and misrepresents his\ngoals.

In\nthe 1960s, his papers on stellar dynamics led to fundamental insights into the\nequilibria of elliptical galaxies, the growth of spiral patterns in disc\ngalaxies and the stability of differentially rotating, self-gravitating flows.\nDonald introduced the ideas of `violent relaxation' and `the gravothermal\ncatastrophe' in pioneering work on the thermodynamics of galaxies and negative\nheat capacities. He shared the inaugural Kavli Prize in Astrophysics in 2008\nfor his contributions to our understanding of quasars. His prediction that dead\nquasars or supermassive black holes may reside in the nuclei of nearby galaxies\nhas been confirmed by multiple pieces of independent evidence. His work on\naccretion discs led to new insights into their workings, as well as the\nrealisation that the infrared excess in T Tauri stars was caused by\nprotostellar discs around these young stars. He introduced the influential idea\nof monolithic collapse of a gas cloud as a formation mechanism for the Milky\nWay Galaxy. As this gave way to modern ideas of merging and accretion as\ndrivers of galaxy formation, Donald was the first to realise the importance of\ntidal streams as measures of the past history and present day gravity field of\nthe Galaxy. Though primarily a theorist, Donald participated in one of the\nfirst observational programs to measure the large-scale streaming of nearby\ngalaxies. This led to the discovery of the `Great Attractor'. The depth and\nversatility of his contributions mark Donald out as one of the most influential\nand pre-eminent astronomers of his day.\n",

From the observer's perspective, the chances of surviving $m$\ntrials monotonically decreases with increasing $m$. As a result, if the\nobserver is still alive for sufficiently large $m$ she must reject any\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics which is not the many-worlds interpretation\n(MWI), since surviving $m$ trials becomes vanishingly unlikely in a single\nworld, whereas a version of the observer will necessarily survive in the\nbranching MWI universe. Here we ask whether this conclusion still holds if\nrather than a classical understanding of limits built on classical logic we\ninstead require our physics to satisfy a computability requirement by\ninvestigating the Everett Box in a model of a computational universe running on\na variety of constructive logic, Recursive Constructive Mathematics. We show\nthat although the standard Everett argument rejecting non-MWI interpretations\nis no longer valid, we can show that Everett's conclusion still holds within a\ncomputable universe.

The\nfundamendalist interpretations consider for each of these roles whether they\nare instantiated fundamentally or emergently. The breakdown interpretations\nfocus on the question of whether $\\Phi$ signals the breakdown, in some sense to\nbe specified, of the MG-DM dichotomy and perhaps even the broader\nspacetime-matter distinction.

We address the\nquestion of how to interpret this breakdown, restricting our attention to\nclassical considerations (though our work has ramifications for more general\nclassical metric theories of gravity, as well). In particular, we argue for a\nnew claim: spacetime singularities in general relativity signal indeterminism.\n  The usual manner in which indeterminism is formulated for physical theories\ncan be traced back to Laplace. This formulation is based on the non-uniqueness\nof future (or past) states of a physical system -- as understood in the context\nof a physical theory -- as a result of the specification of an antecedent state\n(or, respectively, of a subsequent state). We contend that for physical\ntheories generally, this formulation does not comprehensively capture the\nrelevant sense of a lack of determination. And, in particular, it does not\ncomprehensively capture the sense(s) in which a lack of determination (and so,\nindeterminism) arises due to spacetime singularities in general relativity.\n  We thus present a novel, broader formulation, in which indeterminism in the\ncontext of some physical theory arises whenever one of the three following\nconditions holds: future (and/or past) states are (i) not unique -- as for\nLaplacian notions of indeterminism; (ii) not specified; or (iii) `incoherent'\n-- that is, they fail to satisfy certain desiderata that are internal to the\ntheory and/or imposed from outside the theory. We apply this formulation to\nsalient features of singularities in general relativity and show that this\nbroader sense of indeterminism can comprehensively account for (our\ninterpretation of) the breakdown signaled by their occurrence.\n",

Besides the famous lectures given at\nCaltech in 1962-63, he extensively discussed this subject in a series of\nlectures delivered at the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1966-67, whose focus was\non astronomy and astrophysics. All this material allows to reconstruct a\ndetailed picture of Feynman's ideas on gravity and of their evolution until the\nlate sixties. According to him, gravity, like electromagnetism, has quantum\nfoundations, therefore general relativity has to be regarded as the classical\nlimit of an underlying quantum theory; this quantum theory should be\ninvestigated by computing physical processes, as if they were experimentally\naccessible. The same attitude is shown with respect to gravitational waves, as\nis evident also from an unpublished letter addressed to Victor F. Weisskopf. In\naddition, an original approach to gravity, which closely mimics (and probably\nwas inspired by) the derivation of the Maxwell equations given by Feynman in\nthat period, is sketched in the unpublished Hughes lectures.\n",

A conference in April 1943 at Los Alamos provided a simple\nformula used to compute critical masses, and laid out the research program\nneeded to determine the key nuclear constants. In short order, four university\naccelerators were disassembled and reassembled at Los Alamos, and methods were\nestablished to make measurements on extremely small samples owing to the\ninitial lack of availability of enriched 235 U and plutonium. I trace the\nprogram that measured fission cross sections, fission emitted neutron\nmultiplicities and their energy spectra, and transport cross sections,\ncomparing the measurements with our best understanding today as embodied in the\nEvaluated Nuclear Data File ENDF/B-VIII.0. The large nuclear data uncertainties\nat the beginning of the project, which often exceeded 25--50%, were reduced by\n1945, often to less than 5-10%. 235 U and 239 Pu fission cross section\nassessments in the fast MeV range were reduced with more accurate measurements,\nand the neutron multiplicity increased. By a lucky coincidence of cancelling\nerrors, the initial critical mass estimates were close to the final estimated\nmasses. Some images from historical documents from our Los Alamos archives are\nshown. Many of the original measurements from these early years have not\npreviously been widely available. Through this work, these data have now been\narchived in the international experimental nuclear reaction data library\n(EXFOR) in a collaboration with the IAEA and Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n",

Beginning with microgram quantities of plutonium metal late\nin 1943, initial measurements showed a wide and confusing variance in density\nand other properties. These confusing results were the first clues to the\nastounding complexity of plutonium. As this complexity was revealed, it\nintroduced new challenges for the fabrication of kilogram-scale parts. In a\nremarkable period from January 1944 to June 1945, Manhattan Project scientists\nmade rapid progress in understanding plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. By\nearly 1945, they had discovered five of the six ambient-pressure phases of\nunalloyed plutonium and reported the density of these phases to within a value\nof 0.1 g/cm$^3$ of those accepted today. They solved the stability problem\nintroduced by these phases with a rapid alloy development program that\nultimately identified gallium as the preferred element to stabilize the\ndelta-phase, producing a plutonium alloy still of scientific and technical\ninterest today. We conclude with a description of post-war developments in\nthese areas, including applications of wartime plutonium metallurgy to civilian\napplications in nuclear reactors. We dedicate this paper to the memory of Ed\nHammel, the Manhattan Project plutonium metallurgist whose previous description\nand documentation of plutonium history during the war has been essential in our\nresearch.\n",

The majority of the\npioneering research occurred within the Manhattan Project. A range of\nLagrangian hydrodynamic schemes were created between 1943 and 1948 by John von\nNeumann, Rudolf Peierls, Tony Skyrme, and Robert Richtmyer. These schemes\nvaried significantly from each other; however, they all used a staggered-grid\nand finite difference approximations of the derivatives in the governing\nequations, where the first scheme was by von Neumann. These ground-breaking\nschemes were principally published in Los Alamos laboratory reports that were\neventually declassified many decades after authorship, which motivates us to\ndocument the work and describe the accompanying history in a paper that is\naccessible to the broader scientific community. Furthermore, we seek to correct\nhistorical omissions on the pivotal contributions made by Peierls and Skyrme to\ncreating robust Lagrangian hydrodynamic methods for simulating shock driven\nflows. Understanding the history of Lagrangian hydrodynamic methods can help\nexplain the origins of many modern schemes and may inspire the pursuit of new\nschemes.\n",

This gives the impression that\nNoether's first theorem is in some sense not working. In recognition of this\nissue, common practice is to ``improve\" the canonical Noether energy-momentum\ntensor by adding suitable ad-hoc ``improvement\" terms that will convert the\ncanonical expression into the desired result.

The metaphysics can place demands\non the proper formulations of physical theories. It is sometimes assumed that\nthe governing view requires a fundamental / intrinsic direction of time: to\ngovern, laws must be dynamical, producing later states of the world from\nearlier ones, in accord with the fundamental direction of time in the universe.\nIn this paper, we propose a minimal primitivism about laws of nature (MinP)\naccording to which there is no such requirement. On our view, laws govern by\nconstraining the physical possibilities. Our view captures the essence of the\ngoverning view without taking on extraneous commitments about the direction of\ntime or dynamic production. Moreover, as a version of primitivism, our view\nrequires no reduction / analysis of laws in terms of universals, powers, or\ndispositions. Our view accommodates several potential candidates for\nfundamental laws, including the principle of least action, the Past Hypothesis,\nthe Einstein equation of general relativity, and even controversial examples\nfound in the Wheeler-Feynman theory of electrodynamics and retrocausal theories\nof quantum mechanics. By understanding governing as constraining, non-Humeans\nwho accept MinP have the same freedom to contemplate a wide variety of\ncandidate fundamental laws as Humeans do.\n",

It is thus tempting to adopt scientific realism about dark\nmatter. However, there are barely any constraints on the myriad of possible\nproperties of this entity -- it is not even certain that it is a form of\nmatter. In light of this underdetermination I advocate caution: we should not\n(yet) be dark matter realists. The \"not(-yet)-realism\" that I have in mind is\ndifferent from Hacking's (1989) anti-realism, in that it is semantic rather\nthan epistemological. It also differs from the semantic anti-realism of logical\nempiricism, in that it is naturalistic, such that it may only be temporary and\ndoes not automatically apply to all other unobservables (or even just to all\nother astronomical unobservables, as with Hacking's anti-realism). The argument\nis illustrated with the analogy of the much longer history of the concept of a\ngene, as the current state of the concept of dark matter resembles in some\nrelevant ways that of the early concept of genes.\n",

I discuss the early\nhistory of this notion of quantization with emphasis on the works of\nSchr\\\"odinger and Dirac, and how quantization fit into their overall\nunderstanding of quantum theory in the 1920's. Dirac, in particular, proposed a\nquantization map which should satisfy certain properties, including the\nproperty that quantum commutators should be related to classical Poisson\nbrackets in a particular way. However, in 1946, Groenewold proved that Dirac's\nmapping was inconsistent, making the problem of defining a rigorous\nquantization map more elusive than originally expected. This result, known as\nthe Groenewold-Van Hove theorem, is not often discussed in physics texts, but\nhere I will give an account of the theorem and what it means for potential\n\"corrections\" to Dirac's scheme. Other proposals for quantization have arisen\nover the years, the first major one being that of Weyl in 1927, which was later\ndeveloped by many, including Groenewold, and which has since become known as\nWeyl Quantization in the mathematical literature. Another, known as Geometric\nQuantization, formulates quantization in differential-geometric terms by\nappealing to the character of classical phase spaces as symplectic manifolds;\nthis approach began with the work of Souriau, Kostant, and Kirillov in the\n1960's. I will describe these proposals for quantization and comment on their\nrelation to Dirac's original program. Along the way, the problem of operator\nordering and of quantizing in curvilinear coordinates will be described, since\nthese are natural questions that immediately present themselves when thinking\nabout quantization.\n",

        "summary": "  A crucial step in the history of General Relativity was Einstein's adoption\nof the principle of general covariance which demands a coordinate independent\nformulation for our spacetime theories. General covariance helps us to\ndisentangle a theory's substantive content from its merely representational\nartifacts. It is an indispensable tool for a modern understanding of spacetime\ntheories. Motivated by quantum gravity, one may wish to extend these notions to\nquantum spacetime theories (whatever those are). Relatedly, one might want to\nextend these notions to discrete spacetime theories (i.e., lattice theories).\nThis paper delivers such an extension with surprising consequences.\n  One's first intuition regarding discrete spacetime theories may be that they\nintroduce a great deal of fixed background structure (i.e., a lattice) and\nthereby limit our theory's possible symmetries down to those which preserve\nthis fixed structure (i.e., discrete symmetries). However, as I will discuss,\nthese intuitions are doubly wrong and overhasty. Discrete spacetime theories\ncan and do have continuous translation and rotation symmetries. Moreover, the\nexact same theory can be given a wide variety of lattice structures and can\neven be described with no lattice at all. As my discrete analog of general\ncovariance will reveal: lattice structure is rather less like a fixed\nbackground structure or part of an underlying manifold and rather more like a\ncoordinate system, i.e., merely a representational artifact. Thus, the world\ncannot be \"fundamentally set on a square lattice\" (or any other lattice) any\nmore than it could be \"fundamentally set in a certain coordinate system\". Like\ncoordinate systems, lattice structures are just not the sort of thing that can\nbe fundamental; they are both thoroughly representational. Spacetime cannot be\ndiscrete (even when it might be representable as such).\n",

Holographic applications open a path for\nconversation and collaboration between the theory-driven, high energy culture\nof string theory and fields like nuclear and condensed matter physics, which in\ncontrast place great emphasis on the empirical evidence that experiment\nprovides. This paper takes a look at holography's history, from its roots in\nstring theory to its present-day applications that are challenging the cultural\nidentity of the field. I will focus on two of these applications: holographic\nQCD and holographic superconductivity, highlighting some of the (often\nincompatible) historical influences, motives, and epistemic values at play, as\nwell as the subcultural shifts that help the collaborations work. The extent to\nwhich holographic research -- arguably string theory's most successful and\nprolific area -- must change its subcultural identity in order to function in\nfields outside of string theory reflects its changing nature and the field's\nuncertain future. Does string theory lose its identity in the low-energy\napplications that holography provides? Does holography still belong under\nstring theory's umbrella, or is it destined to form new subcultures with each\nof its fields of application? I find that the answers to these questions are\ndynamic, interconnected, and highly dependent on string theory's relationship\nwith its field of application. In some cases, holography can maintain the goals\nand values it inherited from string theory. In others, it instead adopts the\ngoals and values of the field in which it is applied. These examples highlight\na need for the STS community to expand its treatment of string theory beyond\nits relationship with empiricism and role as a theory of quantum gravity.\n",

This reconsideration allows\nus to propose two new ways of conceiving the notion of dimension, which are the\ntwo sides of the same coin. First as an organization; accordingly, we suggest\nthe existence of the Dimensionad, an elementary particle conferring dimension\nto objects and space-time. The idea of the existence of this particle could\npossibly adopted as a projection to create an alternative way to unify quantum\nmechanics and Einstein's general relativity. Secondly, in connection with\nBoltzmann and Shannon entropies, dimension appears essentially as a comparison\nbetween entropies of sets. Thus, we started from the point and succeeded in\nconstructing a point-dimension notion allowing us to extend the principle of\nbox dimension in many directions. More precisely, we introduce the notion of\npoint-extended box dimension in the large framework of topological vector\nspaces, freeing it from the notion of metric. This general setting permits us\nto treat the case of finite, infinite and invisible dimensions. This first part\nof our research project focuses essentially on general properties and is\nparticularly oriented towards establishing a well founded framework for\ninfinite dimension. Among others, one prospect is to test the possibility of\nusing other types of spaces as a setting for quantum mechanics, instead of\nlimiting it to the exclusive Hilbertian framework.\n",

Hence the bulk of the paper is best interpreted\nas arguing that the longstanding claim about separate first-class constraints\nis _either false or trivial_ -- de-Ockhamization (using more when less suffices\nby splitting one quantity into the sum of two) being trivial. Unfortunately\nsection 9 of Pitts 2014, a primarily verbal argument that plays no role in\nother works, is refuted.\n  Pooley and Wallace's inverse Legendre transformation to de-Ockhamized\nelectromagnetism with an additively redefined electrostatic potential, however,\nopens the door to a precisely analogous calculation introducing a photon mass,\nwhich shows that a _second-class primary_ constraint generates a gauge\ntransformation in the exactly same sense -- a reductio ad absurdum of the claim\nthat a first-class constraint generates a gauge transformation and a\nsecond-class constraint does not. Gauge freedom by de-Ockhamization does not\nrequire any constraints at all, first-class or second-class, because any\ndynamical variable in any Lagrangian can be de-Ockhamized into exhibiting\ntrivial additive artificial gauge freedom by splitting one quantity into the\nsum of two.

What to make of such seemingly radical challenges of\ncosmological orthodoxy? In the first part of our paper, we assess MONDian\ntheories through the lens of key ideas of major 20th century philosophers of\nscience (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Laudan), thereby rectifying widespread\nmisconceptions and misapplications of these ideas common in the pertinent\nMOND-related literature. None of these classical methodological frameworks,\nwhich render precise and systematise the more intuitive judgements prevalent in\nthe scientific community, yields a favourable verdict on MOND and its\nsuccessors -- contrary to claims in the MOND-related literature by some of\nthese theories' advocates; the respective theory appraisals are largely\ndamning. Drawing on these insights, the paper's second part zooms in on the\nmost common complaint about MONDian theories, their ad-hocness. We demonstrate\nhow the recent coherentist model of ad-hocness captures, and fleshes out, the\nunderlying -- but too often insufficiently articulated -- hunches underlying\nthis critique. MONDian theories indeed come out as severely ad hoc: they do not\ncohere well with either theoretical or empirical-factual background knowledge.\nIn fact, as our complementary comparison with the cosmological standard model's\nDark Matter postulate shows, with respect to ad-hocness, MONDian theories fare\nworse than the cosmological standard model.\n",

The analysis of\nthe assumptions going into the paradox indicates that there exist multiple ways\nof dealing consistently with uniform probabilities on infinite sample spaces.\nTaking a pluralist stance towards the mathematical methods used in cosmology\nshows there is some room for progress with assigning probabilities in\ncosmological theories.\n",

Through a broad historical analysis, this\nessay aims to (1) give an account of the development of science as an\noscillation and an interplay between its two intrinsic natures, (2) demonstrate\nthat this happened already in ancient times starting from the 6th century BC,\nand (3) the fact that in different periods one of the two natures was largely\nfavored over the other is a consequence of science being a cultural product of\nthe different social-historical contexts.\n",

Hence\nit has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is\nwarranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable.

The first string models and associated\ntheoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the\ncontext of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s,\nthe models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four\nfundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string\ntheory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern\nstring theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an\nS-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities.\nSurprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from\nexperiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum\ngravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the \"hadronic\nstring theory\"), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models'\nparameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to\n\"non-arbitrariness\", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that\ninitially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the\npractical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum\ngravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of\nexperimental data in string theory.\n",

Starting from the first attempt to apply the quantum\nfield theory techniques to perturbatively quantize Einstein's theory, we\nexplore its developments and interaction with the top-down approach encoded by\nString Theory. In the last part of the paper, we focus on this last approach to\ndescribe the relationship between our modern understanding of String Theory and\nEffective Field Theory in today's panorama. To this end, the non-historical\npart briefly explains the modern concepts of moduli stabilization and Swampland\nto understand another change in focus that explains the present framework where\nsome string theorists move.\n",

Correspondingly, the thesis of this\npaper is that pursuing gauge-invariant approaches has several virtues. For\ninstance, gauge-invariant reformulations allow us to make particle physics\nconsistent with the mathematical framework in which it is formulated.

Here, I test this assumption by examining\nNut's visual depictions on ancient Egyptian coffins. I assemble a catalog of\n555 coffin elements, which includes 118 cosmological vignettes from the\n21st/22nd Dynasties, and report several observations. First, I find that the\ncosmological vignette on the outer coffin of Nesitaudjatakhet bears a unique\nfeature: a thick, undulating black curve that bisects Nut's star-studded body\nand recalls the Great Rift that cleaves the Milky Way in two. Moreover, it\nresembles similar features identified as the Milky Way on the bodies of Navajo,\nHopi, and Zuni spiritual beings. Hence, I argue that the undulating curve on\nNut's body is the first visual representation of the Milky Way identified in\nthe Egyptian archaeological record. However, its rarity strengthens the\nconclusion reached by Graur (2024a): Though Nut and the Milky Way are linked,\nthey are not synonymous. Instead of acting as a representation of Nut, the\nMilky Way is one more celestial phenomenon that, like the Sun and the stars, is\nassociated with Nut in her role as the sky. Second, Nut's body is decorated\nwith stars in only a quarter of the vignettes. If we associate Nut's naked and\nstar-studded forms with the day and night sky, respectively, we would expect to\nsee stars in half of the vignettes. This null hypothesis is rejected at\n$>6\\sigma$ statistical significance. For whatever reason, it appears that the\nEgyptians of the 21st/22nd Dynasties preferred the day sky over the night sky.\nFinally, I discuss the interplay between Nut's cosmological vignette and\nfull-length portraits inside coffins from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period\nin light of Nut's combined cosmological and eschatological roles as an\nembodiment of the coffin.\n",

Despite their great historical\nrelevance, both regarding the beliefs and funerary customs of the local\npopulations and the characteristics of the landscape in the highlands, little\nis known about the relationship of these mortuary monuments with the sky.\nSeveral authors, from chroniclers of the colonial era to more modern explorers,\nindicate that the tomb towers of these regions are oriented in such a way that\nimportant parts of their structure (in general, the entrances of the chullpas)\npoint towards the sunrise on the eastern horizon, in order to be imbued with\nthe first rays of the Sun. However, the sunrise changes its location noticeably\nat different times of the year. Given the lack of written information or other\nforms of original documentation, in order to affirm the use of a systematic\norientation, it is necessary to measure a statistically significant number of\nmonuments. We present here the results of the analysis of the precise spatial\norientation of the entrances of 80 towers measured in situ during field work in\nthe Lauca River valley. We find that, except for a few, all the buildings have\nthe openings' axes oriented towards the east and within the solar range,\nbetween the extreme azimuths of the annual movement of the Sun as it crosses\nthe local horizon, with a notable concentration of entrances that point\nslightly towards the north of due east. Our work is the first systematic study\nof the orientations of the chullpa towers of the Lauca River and can provide\ncrucial information to understand the evolution and scope of the chullpa\nphenomenon in the Bolivian highlands and in the entire surrounding region.\n",

Since in arxiv/2412.13640 paper we find\nmentioned by Magli the pyramid of Cheops (that is Akhet Khufu, a name which is\ngenerally translated as the Khufu's horizon) and the symbol of the 'solarized'\nhorizon, N27 of the Gardiner's list, it is necessary to stress that the word\nAkhet was written with the crested ibis, G25, as clearly shown by the Wadi\nal-Jarf papyri, which are contemporary to Khufu's reign. Mark Lehner, 2001,\nrecognizing a translation problem, rendered Akhet Khufu as the 'Spirit of\nKhufu'. The use of the crested ibis, in a locution translated as 'dwellers of\nthe horizon' is attested in a Pepi II letter to his vizier Herkhuf, then three\ncenturies after Khufu.\n",

        "summary": "  This is a work of hard physical philosophy, where Quantum Perspectivism is\nshown to function as both an interpretation of quantum mechanics and a physical\nmodel for understanding Nietzsche's perspectivism. This framework combines\nquantum logic, the principle of complementarity, and contextuality to examine\nhow perspectives construct reality. In this model, measurements correspond to\nPerspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and\nHilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert\nlattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological\nreality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a\ngiven system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding\nmeta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality.\n  Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single\nmeasurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed\nproperties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis\nof multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete\nunderstanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and\ncontextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of\nclassical objectivity in the quantum domain. Advocating for a perspectival view\nof both the world and truth, Quantum Perspectivism unites quantum mechanics and\nNietzschean philosophy into a cohesive framework for exploring the interplay\nbetween consciousness, observation, and reality.\n",

Such debates revolve\naround whether and to what extent cosmology meets established demarcation\ncriteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining how to best\ncharacterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges and\nlimitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin, composition,\nand fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in light of the\ndramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the\n1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the scientific status\nof cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an emerging science to a\ncornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical successes in\nestablishing the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model and in its\ndelivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this remarkable\nscientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology faces a further\nprofound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical\nnature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter, and dark\nenergy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in revealing\nthe microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the epistemic\nbarriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of these\nexotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon whether\ncosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges. We conclude\nby reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical\narguments which could decide this issue conclusively.\n",

Starting by the well-known works\nby Klein-Gordon and Dirac, we then give an account of the main results achieved\nby a variety of different authors, ranging from de Broglie to Proca, Majorana,\nFierz-Pauli, Kemmer, Rarita-Schwinger and many others.\n  A particular interest comes out for the general problem of the description of\nparticles with \\textit{arbitrary} spin, introduced (and solved) by Majorana as\nearly as 1932, and later reconsidered, within a different approach, by Dirac in\n1936 and by Fierz-Pauli in 1939. The final settlement of the problem in 1945 by\nBhabha, who came back to the general ideas introduced by Majorana in 1932, is\ndiscussed as well, and, by making recourse also to unpublished documents by\nMajorana, we are able to reconstruct the line of reasoning behind the Majorana\nand the Bhabha equations, as well as its evolution. Intriguingly enough, such\nan evolution was \\textit{identical} in the two authors, the difference being\njust the period of time required for that: probably few weeks in one case\n(Majorana), while more than ten years in the other one (Bhabha), with the\ncontribution of several intermediate authors.\n  Majorana's paper of 1932, in fact, contrary to the more complicated\nDirac-Fierz-Pauli formalism, resulted to be very difficult to fully understand\n(probably for its pregnant meaning and latent physical and mathematical\ncontent): as is clear from his letters, even Pauli (who suggested its reading\nto Bhabha) took about one year in 1940-1 to understand it. This just testifies\nfor the difficulty of the problem, and for the depth of Majorana's reasoning\nand results.\n",

The easy problem can be solved by\nformulating Bertrand's question in sufficiently precise terms, so allowing for\na non ambiguous modelization of the entity subjected to the randomization. We\nthen show that once the easy problem is settled, also the hard problem becomes\nsolvable, provided Laplace's principle of insufficient reason is applied not to\nthe outcomes of the experiment, but to the different possible \"ways of\nselecting\" an interaction between the entity under investigation and that\nproducing the randomization. This consists in evaluating a huge average over\nall possible \"ways of selecting\" an interaction, which we call a 'universal\naverage'. Following a strategy similar to that used in the definition of the\nWiener measure, we calculate such universal average and therefore solve the\nhard problem of Bertrand's paradox.

It is also a\ntremendous success of the theory of General Relativity. It confirms the\nexistence of black holes; shows that binary black holes exist; that they may\ncollide and that during the merging process gravitational waves are produced.\nThese are all predictions of General Relativity theory in its fully nonlinear\nregime. The existence of gravitational waves was predicted by Albert Einstein\nin 1916 within the framework of linearized Einstein theory. Contrary to common\nbelief, even the very \\emph{definition} of a gravitational wave in the fully\nnonlinear Einstein theory was provided only after Einstein's death. Actually,\nEinstein had arguments against the existence of nonlinear gravitational waves\n(they were erroneous but he did not accept this), which virtually stopped\ndevelopment of the subject until the mid 1950s. This is what we refer to as the\n\\emph{Red Light} for gravitational waves research. In the following years, the\ntheme was picked up again and studied vigorously by various experts, mainly\nHerman Bondi, Felix Pirani, Ivor Robinson and Andrzej Trautman, where the\ntheoretical obstacles concerning gravitational wave existence were successfully\novercome, thus giving the `Green Light' for experimentalists to start designing\ndetectors, culminating in the recent LIGO/VIRGO discovery. In this note we tell\nthe story of this theoretical breakthrough. Particular attention is given to\nthe fundamental 1958 papers of Trautman, which seem to be lesser known outside\nthe circle of General Relativity experts.

His\nresearch and insights had large impacts on nuclear and particle physics, the\ndesign of nuclear weapons, general relativity and relativistic astrophysics,\nand quantum gravity and quantum information. But his greatest impacts were\nthrough the students, postdocs, and mature physicists whom he educated and\ninspired.\n  He was guided by what he called the principle of radical conservatism,\ninspired by Niels Bohr: base your research on well established physical laws\n(be conservative), but push them into the most extreme conceivable domains (be\nradical). He often pushed far beyond the boundaries of well understood physics,\nspeculating in prescient ways that inspired future generations of physicists.\n  After completing his PhD with Karl Herzfeld at Johns Hopkins University\n(1933), Wheeler embarked on a postdoctoral year with Gregory Breit at NYU and\nanother with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He then moved to a three-year assistant\nprofessorship at the University of North Carolina (1935-37), followed by a 40\nyear professorial career at Princeton University (1937-1976) and then ten years\nas a professor at the University of Texas, Austin (1976-1987). He returned to\nPrinceton in retirement but remained actively and intensely engaged with\nphysics right up to his death at age 96.\n",

Weyl's proposal of 1918 for generalizing Riemannian geometry by local\nscale gauge (later called {\\em Weyl geometry}) was motivated by mathematical,\nphilosophical and physical considerations. It was the starting point of his\nunified field theory of electromagnetism and gravity. After getting\ndisillusioned with this research program and after the rise of a convincing\nalternative for the gauge idea by translating it to the phase of wave functions\nand spinor fields in quantum mechanics, Weyl no longer considered the original\nscale gauge as physically relevant.\n  About the middle of the last century the question of conformal and/or local\nscale gauge transformation were reconsidered by different authors in high\nenergy physics (Bopp, Wess, et al.) and, independently, in gravitation theory\n(Jordan, Fierz, Brans, Dicke). In this context Weyl geometry attracted new\ninterest among different groups of physicists (Omote/Utiyama/Kugo,\nDirac/Canuto/Maeder, Ehlers/Pirani/Schild and others), often by hypothesizing a\nnew scalar field linked to gravity and/or high energy physics. Although not\ncrowned by immediate success, this ``retake'' of Weyl geometrical methods lives\non and has been extended a century after Weyl's first proposal of his basic\ngeometrical structure. It finds new interest in present day studies of\nelementary particle physics, cosmology, and philosophy of physics.\n",

To illustrate and understand the differing opinions about proper\npractice and identity, we discuss different appreciations of epistemic virtues\nand explanation among string theorists and their critics, and how these have\nbeen sourced in accounts of Einstein's biography. Just as Einstein is claimed\nby both sides, historiography offers examples of both successful and\nunsuccessful non-empirical science. History of science also teaches that times\nof conflict are often times of innovation, in which novel scholarly identities\nmay come into being. At the same time, since the contributions of Thomas Kuhn\nhistorians have developed a critical attitude towards formal attempts and\nmethodological recipes for epistemic demarcation and justification of\nscientific practice.

Instead,\nwe propose to consider algebraic structures in which all (and only) physical\nfields are primitive.

However, the\nnotion of `causation' is limiting - insisting that a physical theory must\ninvolve causal structure already places significant constraints on the form\nthat theory may take. Thus in this paper, we aim to set out a more general\nstructural framework. We argue that any quantitative physical theory can be\nrepresented in the form of a generative program, i.e. a list of instructions\nshowing how to generate the empirical data; the information-processing\nstructure associated with this program can be represented by a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG). We suggest that these graphs can be interpreted as encoding\nrelations of `ontological priority,' and that ontological priority is a\nsuitable generalisation of causation which applies even to theories that don't\nhave a natural causal structure. We discuss some applications of our framework\nto philosophical questions about realism, operationalism, free will, locality\nand fine-tuning.\n",

This can lead women scientists to underperform or to\nleave their scientific career because of negative stereotypes such as, not\nbeing as talented or as interested in science as men. Sadly, history rarely\nprovides role models for women scientists; instead, it often renders these\nwomen invisible. In response to this situation, we present a selection of\ntwelve outstanding women who helped to develop nuclear astrophysics.\n",

The question arises then of whether the concept of\na region smaller than the scale - and ultimately the concept of a point - makes\nsense in such a theory. We argue that it does not, in two interrelated ways. In\nthe context of Connes' spectral triple approach, we show that arbitrarily small\nregions are not definable in the formal sense. While in the scalar field\nMoyal-Weyl approach, we show that they cannot be given an operational\ndefinition. We conclude that points do not exist in such geometries. We\ntherefore investigate (a) the metaphysics of such a geometry, and (b) how the\nappearance of smooth manifold might be recovered as an approximation to a\nfundamental noncommutative geometry.\n",

However, this paper\ndemonstrates that the current elaborations of this programme neglect quantum\ninteractions. The paper then introduces the Faddeev--Mickelsson anomaly which\nobstructs the renormalization of Yang--Mills theory, suggesting that to\ntheorise on many-particle systems requires a many-topos view of mathematics\nitself: higher theory. As our main contribution, the topos theoretic framework\nis used to conceptualise the fact that there are principally three different\nquantisation problems, the differences of which have been ignored not just by\ntopos physicists but by most philosophers of science. We further argue that if\nhigher theory proves out to be necessary for understanding quantum gravity, its\nimplications to philosophy will be foundational: higher theory challenges the\npropositional concept of truth and thus the very meaning of theorising in\nscience.\n",

First, we make explicit the dimensions that underlie the notion of\nriskiness. Secondly, we examine if and how degrees of falsifiability can be\ndefined, and how they are related to various dimensions of the concept of\nriskiness as well as the experimental context. Thirdly, we consider the\nrelation of riskiness to (expected degrees of) truthlikeness. Throughout, we\npay special attention to probabilistic theories and we offer a tentative,\nquantitative account of verisimilitude for probabilistic theories.\n",

This work is an attempt at conceptualizing the\nmetaphysics of pregeometric structures, upon which new and existing notions of\nquantum geometry may find a foundation. We discuss the philosophy of\npregeometric structures due to Wheeler, Leibniz as well as modern\nmanifestations in topos theory. We draw attention to evidence suggesting that\nthe framework of formal language, in particular, homotopy type theory, provides\nthe conceptual building blocks for a theory of pregeometry. This work is\nlargely a synthesis of ideas that serve as a precursor for conceptualizing the\nnotion of space in physical theories. In particular, the approach we espouse is\nbased on a constructivist philosophy, wherein ``structureless structures'' are\nsyntactic types realizing formal proofs and programs. Spaces and algebras\nrelevant to physical theories are modeled as type-theoretic routines\nconstructed from compositional rules of a formal language. This offers the\nremarkable possibility of taxonomizing distinct notions of geometry using a\ncommon theoretical framework. In particular, this perspective addresses the\ncrucial issue of how spatiality may be realized in models that link formal\ncomputation to physics, such as the Wolfram model.\n",
