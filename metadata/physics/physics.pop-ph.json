This phenomenon has gained recent\nattention due to experimental observations of the history dependent relaxation\nbehavior in amorphous materials (``Glasses'') which pose a challenge to\ntheorist. Aging signals the breaking of time-translational invariance and the\nviolation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem during the relaxation process.\nBut while the origin of aging in disordered media is profound, and the\ndiscussion is clad in the language of a well-developed theory, systems as\nsimple as a random walk near a wall can exhibit aging. Such a simple walk\nserves well to illustrate the phenomenon and some of the physics behind it.\n",

Using a model comprising diffuse light\ntransport and photonic band structure, we quantitatively explain the\ndirectional emission spectra. This provides detailed understanding of the\ntransport of spontaneously emitted light in real photonic crystals, which is\nessential in the interpretation of quantum-optics in photonic band-gap crystals\nand for applications wherein directional emission and total emission power are\ncontrolled.\n",

We propose\nthree laws of aesthetic complexity. According to the first law of aesthetic\ncomplexity, too condensed encoding makes a decryption of a work of art\nimpossible and is perceived as chaotic by the untrained mind, whereas too\nregular structures are perceived as monotonous, too orderly and not very\nstimulating. Thus a necessary condition for an artistic form or design to\nappear appealing is its complexity to lie within a bracket between monotony and\nchaos. According to the second law of aesthetic complexity, due to human\npredisposition, this bracket is invariably based on natural forms; with rather\nlimited plasticity. The third law of aesthetic complexity states that aesthetic\ncomplexity trends are dominated by the available resources, and thus also by\ncost and scarcity.\n",

The drag force acting on a sprinter is a function of air density and the\nrelative wind speed, where the former has traditionally been calculated using\nthe race venue's elevation above sea level. However, air density variation is\ndependent on more than just altitude. This work will quantify how changes in\nair temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity levels influence 100 m\nsprint performances. When these effects are considered in combination, the\ncorrections to performances can be very large. The results suggest that a\nnon-negligible difference in race times can be expected for ``equivalent''\nperformances run with the same wind speed at the same venue or physical\naltitude, but under different atmospheric conditions.\n",

The magnitude\nof the effects are found to be dependent on wind speed. This implies that\ndiffering atmospheric conditions can yield slightly different corrections for\nthe same wind gauge reading. In the absence of wind, temperature is found to\ninduce the largest variation in times (0.01 s per $10\\dc$ increment in the 100\nm), while relative humidity contributes the least (under 0.01 s for all\nrealistic conditions for 100 m). Barometric pressure variations at a particular\nvenue can also introduce fluctuations in performance times on the order of a\n0.01 s for this race. The combination of all three variables is essentially\nadditive, and is more important for head-wind conditions that for tail-winds.\nAs expected, calculated corrections in the 200 m are magnified due to the\nlonger duration of the race. The overall effects of these factors on sprint\ntimes can be considered a ``second order'' adjustment to previous methods which\nrely strictly on a venue's physical elevation, but can become important in\nextreme conditions.\n",

Due to finite and constant velocity of\nlight these photons left the moving body at different times, since not all\npoints of the body are equidistant. In other words its image represents the\nbody as it was in several different times i.e. it is distorted and does not\ncorrespond to its real appearance. The useful experimental arrangement is set\nand then used to derive the general expression that transforms two-dimensional\nstationary shapes to their apparent forms, which could be photographed once\nthey are set in motion. It is then used to simulate the so-called Gamow's\nbicycle combined out of circles and straight lines. The simulation outlines two\nimportant aspects of bike's motion: apparent distance of two points and\napparent velocity which are then discussed thoroughly. It is found that the\napproaching body is elongated and its apparent speed is greater than its real\none (under certain conditions can exceed the speed of light), whereas the\nreceding one is contracted (but not in a matter of Lorentz contraction) with\nthe speed smaller than the real one. Both the apparent length and speed tends\nto a certain limit when time tends to plus or minus infinity. The change of\nboth parameters takes place in the vicinity of the nearest approach to the\nobserver and is more rapid when the velocity greater and the distance is\nsmaller. When the moving vertical rod is seen at right angle, its total\napparent length is Lorentz contracted, however its interior is still distorted.\nAt the same conditions apparent velocity of a point equals its real one.\nFinally it is proven that not only the apparent geometrical shape changes as\nthe body moves but also its color according to Doppler shift.\n",

The player's optimum release angle was calculated by\nsubstituting mathematical expressions for the measured relations between\nrelease speed, release height, and release angle into the equations for the\nflight of a spherical projectile. We found that the musculoskeletal structure\nof the player's body had a strong influence on the optimum release angle. When\nusing low release angles the player released the ball with a greater release\nspeed, and because the range of a projectile is strongly dependent on the\nrelease speed, this bias toward low release angles reduced the optimum release\nangle to about 30 degrees. Calculations showed that the distance of a throw may\nbe increased by a few metres by launching the ball with a fast backspin, but\nthe ball must be launched at a slightly lower release angle.\n",

For\nexample, the answers to the questions \"Where to search\" and \"Where to send\" are\nequivalent, in that both require an identical selection from the same target\nstar lists. Similar considerations lead to a strategy of time synchronization\nbetween sending and searching. Both SETI and METI use large reflectors. The\nconcept of \"magic frequencies\" may be applicable to both SETI and METI. Efforts\nto understand an alien civilization's Interstellar Messages (IMs), and efforts\nto compose our own IMs so they will be easily understood by unfamiliar\nExtraterrestrials, are mutually complementary. Furthermore, the METI-question:\n\"How can we benefit from sending IMs, if a response may come only thousands of\nyears later?\" begs an equivalent SETI-question: \"How can we benefit from\nsearching, if it is impossible now to perceive the motivations and feelings of\nthose who may have sent messages in the distant past?\" A joint consideration of\nthe theoretical and the practical aspects of both sending and searching for\nIMs, in the framework of a unified, disciplined scientific approach, can be\nquite fruitful.

Plasma surface treatments show\ndistinct advantages, because they are able to modify the surface properties of\ninert materials, sometimes with environment friendly devices. For fabrics, cold\nplasma treatments require the development of reliable and large systems. Such\nsystems are now existing and the use of plasma physics in industrial problems\nis rapidly increasing. On textile surfaces, three main effects can be obtained\ndepending on the treatment conditions: the cleaning effect, the increase of\nmicroroughness (anti-pilling finishing of wool) and the production of radicals\nto obtain hydrophilic surfaces. Plasma polymerisation, that is the deposition\nof solid polymeric materials with desired properties on textile substrates, is\nunder development. The advantage of such plasma treatments is that the\nmodification turns out to be restricted in the uppermost layers of the\nsubstrate, thus not affecting the overall desirable bulk properties. Here, we\npresent the research results on the use of plasma physics in textile properties\nmodification. Treatments on natural, wool and cotton, and on synthetic polymers\nto improve wetting are shown. Hydrophilic-hydrophobic treatments,\ndirt-repellent coatings are presented.

This paper describes a set of\ntowering pop-ups with trajectories that exhibit cusps and loops near the apex.\nFor a normal fly ball, the horizontal velocity is continuously decreasing due\nto drag caused by air resistance. But for pop-ups, the Magnus force (the force\ndue to the ball spinning in a moving airflow) is larger than the drag force. In\nthese cases the horizontal velocity decreases in the beginning, like a normal\nfly ball, but after the apex, the Magnus force accelerates the horizontal\nmotion. We refer to this class of pop-ups as paradoxical because they appear to\nmisinform the typically robust optical control strategies used by fielders and\nlead to systematic vacillation in running paths, especially when a trajectory\nterminates near the fielder. In short, some of the dancing around when\ninfielders pursue pop-ups can be well explained as a combination of bizarre\ntrajectories and misguidance by the normally reliable optical control strategy,\nrather than apparent fielder error. Former major league infielders confirm that\nour model agrees with their experiences.\n",

We deduce the maximum force, the\nmaximum power, and the total mechanical energy produced by Bolt in both races.\nSurprisingly, we conclude that all of these values were smaller in 2009 than in\n2008.\n",

The possibility of\nintentionally re-combining a pair into pseudo-degeneracy was explored by adding\nmass to various locations on a C4 handbell. Depending on the location and mass\nadded to the bell, the modes can be shifted in position and frequency as\nobserved by a real-time holographic interferometry system. By moving and\nvarying the added mass, one pair of modes was successfully brought into a\npseudo-degeneracy.\n",

The Quark Model, based in the\nmathematical structures of group theory, provided in the beginning of the 60's\na simplified description of hadronic matter already known, proposing that three\nparticles, called quarks, would originate all the observed hadrons. This model\nwas able to preview the existence of particles that were later detected,\nconfirming its consistency. Extensions of the Quark Model were made in the\nbeginning of the 70's, focusing in describing observed particles that were\nexcited states of the fundamental particles and others that presented new\nquantum numbers (flavors). Recently, exotic states as tetraquarks and\npentaquarks types, also called multiquarks systems, previewed by the model,\nwere observed, what renewed the interest in the way as quarks are confined\ninside the hadrons. In this article we present a review of the Quark Model and\na discussion on the new exotic states.\n",

To add a new piece of understanding, we decided to investigate the\neffect of ribs mounted on a soundboard. Apart from pianos, this is important to\na wider class of instruments which radiate from a structured surface. From\nscattering theory, it is well-known that a regular array of scatterers yields a\nband structure. By a systematic study of the latter, the effect of the ribs on\nthe radiated spectrum is demonstrated for a specially manufactured multichord\nmimicking topologically a piano soundboard. To distinguish between radiated\nsound and sound propagated inside the board we use piezopolymers, an\ninnovative, non-invasive technique. As a result we find a dramatic change in\nthe spectrum allowed to propagate in the soundboard which is consequently\nradiated. An explanation by a simple model of coupled oscillators is given with\na very nice qualitative coincidence.\n",

Using a vacuum pump to cool samples of water\ninitially at different temperatures, we measured reproducible temperature\nvalues at which hot and cold water equilibrate. We have confirmed that warmer\nwater indeed cools at a faster rate than colder water and that, surprisingly,\nthis trend continues past the point where the temperatures of the two samples\nare the same. Our results show that when using optimal initial temperature\nconditions, the crossover temperature is found to be 2.7 oC whereas our other\nset of initial conditions gave a crossover temperature of -0.07 oC.

        "summary": "  The development and deployment of interstellar missions will without doubt\nrequire orders of magnitude more resources than needed for current or past\nmegaprojects (Apollo, Iter, LHC,...). Question is how enough resources for such\ngigaprojects can be found. In this contribution different scenarios will be\nexplored assuming limited, moderate economic growth throughout the next\ncenturies, i.e. without human population and productivity continuing to grow\nexponentially, and without extreme events such as economic collapse or\nsingularity. In such a world, which is not unlike the current situation,\ngigascale space projects face a combination of inhibiting factors: the enormous\ncost threshold, the need for risky and costly development of often quite\napplication specific technology, the relatively little benefit with respect to\nthe costs for the sponsors, the time span of at least a few generations and the\nabsence of a sense of urgency. It will be argued that the best chance of\ngetting an interstellar project started in this generation is to establish an\ninternational network of non governmental organizations (NGOs) focused on\nprivate and public fundraising for interstellar exploration, similar to e.g.\nthe WWF. It is shown that this path reduces the massive barriers to entry as\nwell as the level of governmental support needed. The path is argued to fit\nbest with three defining features of gigascale space projects, which should be\nrecognized to the fullest: their almost absolute nonprofit character, their\nmassive cost in terms of time and resources and their non-urgency leading to\nprocrastination. Even if relatively modest but recurring funding is found\nenough resources can be gathered over time, provided the majority of the NGOs'\nincome is saved up in a long term fund similar to that of the Noble Foundation\nor Norway's Government Pension Fund.\n",

Nevertheless, the expression for relativistic\nmass gives a Poincare invariant measure that can be associated as the mass, a\nuseful attribute of the body or system. In the quantum regime, mass becomes\ntruly dynamical.

It\nhas been part of every known civilization on earth. It has become a very part\nof man's need to impose his will upon the universe, to bring order out of chaos\nand to endow his moments of highest awareness with enduring form and substance.\nIt is a form of art dealing with the organization of tones into patterns.\n  Despite of cultural differences, music from different civilizations seems to\nconsist of some building blocks that are universal: melody, harmony, rhythm,\netc. Almost all musical systems are based on scales spanning an octave---the\nnote that sounds the same as the one you started off with, but at a higher or\nlower pitch. It was discovered by Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher who lived\naround 500 BC, that the note an octave higher than another has a frequency\ntwice high. The notes that sound harmonious together have simple rational\nnumber ratios between their frequencies.\n  It is those implicit structures and relationships in apparently mysterious\nmusical experience that I am interested in exploring here. As a scientist by\ntraining with a consistent passion for classical guitar playing, I would like\nmake an attempt to explain the musical experience in terms of science and\nmathematics, hoping to fill some gaps between the knowledge of scientists and\nartistic intuition of musicians.\n",

This paper argues that we can draw\nsome inferences from the history of the Cold War and nuclear deterrence in\norder to show that at least some attack scenarios are likely to be exaggerated.\nIn particular, it would seem to be unlikely that the humanity would be attacked\nsimply because it might, some time in the future, present a threat to the ETI.\nEven if communication proves to be difficult, rational decision-makers should\navoid unprovoked attacks, because their success would be very difficult to\nassure. In general, it seems believable that interstellar conflicts between\ncivilizations would remain rare. The findings advise caution for proposed\ninterstellar missions, however, as starfaring capability itself might be seen\nas a threat. On the other hand, attempting to contact ETIs seems to be a\nrelatively low-risk strategy: paranoid ETIs must also consider the possibility\nthat the messages are a deception designed to lure out hostile civilizations\nand preemptively destroy them.\n",

In this paper, a\nsimulated annealing algorithm is used to numerically model the exploration of\nthe local interstellar neighborhood (i.e. on the order of ten parsecs of the\nSolar System) by a fixed number of probes launched from the Solar System; these\nsimulations use the observed masses, positions and spectral classes of targeted\nstars. Each probe visits a pre-determined list of target systems, maintains a\nconstant cruise speed, and only changes direction from gravitational deflection\nat each target. From these simulations, it is examined how varying design\nchoices -- differing the maximum cruise speed, number of probes launched,\nnumber of target stars to be explored, and probability of avoiding catastrophic\nsystem failure per parsec -- change the completion time of the exploration\nprogram and the expected number of stars successfully visited. In addition, it\nis shown that improving this success probability per parsec has diminishing\nreturns beyond a certain point. Future improvements to the model and possible\nimplications are discussed.\n",

Both\ncombustion chamber and barrel were made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Five\nexperimental propellants were tested: propane (C3H8), acetylene (C2H2), ethanol\n(C2H6O), methanol (CH4O), and butane (C4H10). The amount of each experimental\npropellant was calculated to approximate a stoichometric mixture and\nconsidering the Upper Flammability Limit (UFL) and the Lower Flammability Limit\n(LFL), which in turn were affected by the volume of the combustion chamber.\nCylindrical projectiles were cut from raw potatoes so that there was an\nairtight fit, and each weighed 50 (+/- 0.5) grams. For each trial, position as\na function of time was determined via frame by frame analysis. Five trials were\ntaken for each experimental propellant and the results analyzed to compute\nvelocity and acceleration as functions of time. Additional quantities including\nforce on the potato and the pressure applied to the potato were also computed.\nFor each experimental propellant, average velocity vs. barrel position curves\nwere plotted. The most effective experimental propellant was defined as the one\nwhich accelerated the potato to the highest muzzle velocity. The experimental\npropellant acetylene performed the best on average (138.1 m/s), followed by\nmethanol (48.2 m/s), butane (34.6 m/s), ethanol (33.3 m/s), and propane (27.9\nm/s), respectively.\n",

In this ideal circumstance the problem of choosing optimal\nriding speeds reduces to a constrained nonlinear optimization that can be\nsolved with elementary calculus. My analysis reveals a practical rule of thumb\nthat can be used more generally to choose optimal riding speeds for time-trial\nracing on closed-circuit courses in the presence of headwinds and tailwinds.\n",

To broaden the classical view,the\nfield of experimentation is obviously the high level competition in which most\nof rotational application can be found applied more or less instinctively by\nhigh level Athletes. Considering the two biomechanical tools that are the\nphysical basis of judo throws it is possible to obtain such results from the\nanalysis of high competition application:Lever Techniques are enhanced in their\neffectiveness in three ways: The rotational movements, strictly connected to\nthe Lever techniques mechanics achieving victory in competition, can be\nextended to the unbalance phase. The rotational movements can be applied in a\ntotally new way putting away even the unbalance that is basic in the Lever\ntechniques. The Lever tool can be hybridized with the Couple tool to lower the\nenergy consumption. Couple Techniques are enhanced in their effectiveness also\nin three ways: The Couple tool that doesnt need unbalance allowing uke body\nrotate around his center of mass, is enhanced utilizing the Uke body smaller\nresistance directions,normally summarized in Diagonal attacks. The vertical\nrotational movements in the transverse plan with the axis in the sagittal plane\ncan be added to the Couple application with transverse rotation and axis in the\nfrontal plane to overcome some defensive resistance, mainly in the trunk and\nleg group of Couple techniques,like Uchi Mata or O Soto Gari. The rotational\nmovements enhance the throwing action changing the mechanics of Couple into\nLever applying a Torque,both with the direction change of one force or the time\ndelay of his application. This analysis, expanded with a short physical\nframework, clarifies hidden deep concepts and helps teacher and coaches in\ntheir professional work.\n",

The\nanticipated advantages of such a device are around 25% less drag, for a\ncapability which ranges between equivalent and greater than twofold that of a\nconventional tail. The tail of a popular, radio-controlled, model aircraft is\nreplaced with a rotatable stabiliser and its rotation is effected by way of a\ncontinuously-rotating servo, modified with a potentiometer. Two hollow,\ncarbon-fibre shafts (one sleeved within the other so as to allow free rotation)\nserve as the mechanical link between the servo and the tail. Inserting wiring\nalong the full length of the innermost shaft and incorporating three slip rings\ninto its collar, at the forward, servo end, facilitated an electrical supply to\nthe tail. A mapping betweeen the position of the controls and states of the\nstabiliser is formulated. Small and continuous adjustments cause the stabiliser\nto rotate in the opposite direction to the controls (when viewed from aft) and\nthe deflection of the hinged control surface is proportional to the radial\ndisplacement of the controls from their centred position. For what would amount\nto large and contradictory rotations of the device in terms of this protocol\n(rotations greater than 90$^\\circ$), the desired configuration can be more\nefficiently achieved by regarding the device's original orientation to differ\nby 180$^\\circ$ from what it actually is and by reversing the sign of the\ndeflection. One consequence of this latter mode of control is that a\nsymmetrical aerofoil is indicated. General flight, including static\nlongitudinal and directional stability, was not found to be compromised.\n",

The firing range was mostly\ndarkened with only enough ambient light to safely conduct firing tests at the\ndirection of a range safety officer. There was not enough ambient light to\nidentify the shooter's face. Observers correctly identified the shooter 54% of\nthe time and failed to correctly identify the shooter 46% of the time.\nObservers were unanimous that there was no hint of any visible illumination on\nthe shooter's face provided by the muzzle flash. In cases where the shooter was\ncorrectly identified, observers reported using visual cues such as the\nsillhouette of the shooters' hair and slight differences in arm positions when\nfiring the pistol. Other people in the room (including the author) were in\nunanimous agreement that there was no illumination of the shooters' faces from\ndischarge of a 22 LR pistol.\n",

However, there is a tension between the expectation that such\na probability is relatively high (given our own origins on Earth), and the lack\nof any basis for believing the Solar System has ever been visited by an\nextraterrestrial colonization effort. This paper seeks to place upper limits on\nthe probability of an interstellar civilization arising on a habitable planet\nin its stellar system, using a percolation model to simulate the progress of\nsuch a hypothetical civilization's colonization efforts in the local Solar\nneighborhood. To be as realistic as possible, the actual physical positions and\ncharacteristics of all stars within 40 parsecs of the Solar System are used as\npossible colony sites in the percolation process. If an interstellar\ncivilization is very likely to have such colonization programs, and they can\ntravel over large distances, then the upper bound on the likelihood of such a\nspecies arising per habitable world is on the order of $10^{-3}$; on the other\nhand, if civilizations are not prone to colonize their neighbors, or do not\ntravel very far, then the upper limiting probability is much larger, even of\norder one.\n",

There are two main methods of\ndetermining free flight drag coefficients, or equivalent ballistic\ncoefficients: 1) measuring near and far velocities over a known distance and 2)\nmeasuring a near velocity and time of flight over a known distance. Atmospheric\nconditions must also be known and nearly constant over the flight path. A\nnumber of tradeoffs are important when designing experiments to accurately\ndetermine drag coefficients. The flight distance must be large enough so that\nthe projectile's loss of velocity is significant compared with its initial\nvelocity and much larger than the uncertainty in the near and/or far velocity\nmeasurements. On the other hand, since drag coefficients and ballistic\ncoefficients both depend on velocity, the change in velocity over the flight\npath should be small enough that the average drag coefficient over the path\n(which is what is really determined) is a reasonable approximation to the value\nof drag coefficient at the near and far velocity. This paper considers these\ntradeoffs as well as practical considerations for obtaining accurate near and\nfar velocity measurements and the impact of different sources of error\n(velocity, distance, time, atmospheric conditions, etc.) on the resulting\naccuracy of drag coefficients and ballistic coefficients. For a given level of\naccuracy of various quantities, the method of using near and far velocities\nusually produces drag coefficients with about half the uncertainty of the\nmethod using a near velocity and time of flight.\n",

Additionally, the search for Planet X prior to\nPluto's discovery results in mass calculations that date back several decades\nearlier.

We reassess earlier predictions of Pluto's fate, and rule out the\nhypothesis that Pluto's mass has been constant over the last century. We are\nable to fit linear and quadratic equations to Pluto's mass as a function of\nboth time and distance. The observations that will be made by New Horizons will\nhelp to determine if we can expect Pluto to continue to shrink until it has\nnegative mass, or if it will begin to increase in mass again.\n",

Any\ndevice that generates photons (e.g., a laser) would qualify as a propellantless\n\"photon rocket,\" but the force generated by emitting photons per power input\n(3.33 $\\mu$N/kW) is too small to be a practical propulsion device. The ability\nto generate greater force per power input would be highly desirable, but, as\ndemonstrated in this paper, such a device would be able to operate as a\nperpetual motion machine of the first kind. Since applying a constant force\nresults in a constant acceleration, the kinetic energy of a mass driven by such\na device increases quadratically with time, while the energy input increases\nonly linearly with time. Thus, at some point, the kinetic energy of the\ndevice-driven mass exceeds the energy input, and if this energy is collected\nvia decelerating the mass (via regenerative electromagnetic braking, for\nexample), then there would be a net gain in energy. For devices with\nthrust-to-power ratios on the order of 1 N/kW that have been discussed recently\nin connection with the so-called EM drive, this breakeven occurs at velocities\nlow enough to be feasible with current technology, clearly demonstrating the\nabsurdity of such a device. When relativistic effects are taken into account,\nit is shown that the photon rocket can only reach energy breakeven as the\naccelerated mass asymptotically approaches the speed of light. Thus, any device\nwith a thrust-to-power ratio greater than the photon rocket would be able to\noperate as a perpetual motion machine of the first kind, and thus should be\nexcluded by the First Law of Thermodynamics.\n",

What makes it interesting to students is that recently two research\nteams have attempted to detect thrusts from microwave driven asymmetrical\nresonance cavities (EmDrive or Cannae Drive), and the phenomenon observable in\nthis experiment provides an alternative explanation to the thrusts they\ndetected.\n",

Despite winter depression (also known as\nSeasonal Affective Disorder, SAD) is known and treated since many years,\nworldwide cross-sectional data from 28 countries show a lower frequency of\nsuicide attempts around the equinoxes and a higher frequency in spring (both in\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere). This peak is not compatible with the SAD\nexplanation. However, in recent years epidemiological research has yielded new\nresults, which provide new perspectives on the matter. In fact, the discovery\nof a new pathology called Post-Series Depression (PSD) could provide an\nexplanation of the suicide attempts pattern. The aim of this study is to\nanalyse weekly data in order to compare them with the TV series broadcasting.\nSince medical observations in our sample are distributed over many years, in\norder to compare them as best as we can with the television programming, Grey's\nAnatomy series was chosen. This medical drama has been in the top 10 of most\nviewed TV series since 12 years and it is broadcast all over the world, so that\nit can be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon. A full season of\nthe series is split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the\ncalendar year, and it runs from September through May. Data analysis was made\nin order to prove the correlation between PSD and the increase of suicide\nattempts. Surprisingly, the data analysis shows that the increase of rate of\nsuicide attempts does not coincide with the breaks in Grey's Anatomy\nscheduling, but with the series broadcasting. This therefore suggests that it\nis the series itself to increase the viewer's depression.\n",

Magic is a strategy that has\nbeen largely neglected in the neuroscience community, and may serve as an\nilluminating comparison to the common physics-based approaches. This model\nmakes predictions that it would be really awesome to test experimentally.\nMoreover, the relative simplicity of the pipe cleaner - setting aside the fact\nthat it comes in an overwhelming variety of colors - renders it an excellent\ntheoretical building block with which to create simple network models.

The goal is\nto get accurate speed predictions inspite of the significant real world\ndifficulties of force drift, force hysteresis, rubber ageing, and the very non-\nlinear, non-ideal, force vs. pull distance curves of slingshot rubber bands.\nSlingshots are known to shoot faster under some circumstances when the bands\nare tapered rather than having constant width and stiffness. We give both\nqualitative understanding and numerical predictions of this effect. We consider\ntwo models. The first is based on conservation of energy and is easier to\nimplement, but cannot determine the speeds along the rubber bands without\nmaking assumptions. The second, treats the bands as a series of mass points\nsubject to being pulled by immediately adjacent mass points according to how\nmuch the rubber has been stretched on the two adjacent sides. This is a classic\nmany-body F=ma problem but convergence requires using a particular numerical\ntechnique. It gives accurate predictions (average error +2%, standard deviation\n3%). The basis for these models involves measurements of pull-force vs.\npull-distance. We will show how such measurements can be scaled for increased\nwidth or length, so that minimal calibration measurements are needed to support\nthe models. With a good physical model of a slingshot one is easily able to\ntest a wide range of parameters to determine how to get the fastest shots for a\ngiven pull force and draw length.

The goal of lead-free bullets is\nto gain the advantages of reduced lead use in the environment while maintaining\nequal or better terminal performance. Accepting reduced terminal performance\nwould foolishly risk the lives of military and law enforcement personnel. This\npaper uses the established technique of studying bullet impacts in ballistic\ngelatin to characterize the terminal performance of eight commercial off-the-\nshelf lead-free handgun bullets for comparison with earlier analysis of\njacketed lead bullets. Peak retarding force and energy deposit in calibrated\nballistic gelatin are quantified using high speed video. The temporary stretch\ncavities and permanent wound cavities are also characterized. Two factors tend\nto reduce the terminal performance of these lead-free projectiles compared to\nsimilar jacketed lead designs. First, solid copper construction increase barrel\nfriction, which reduces muzzle velocity and energy, and thus reduces the\nability of the bullet to exert damaging forces in tissue simulant. Second, the\nlower density of copper requires a longer bullet for a given mass and caliber,\nwhich reduces remaining powder volume in the brass cartridge case, which also\ntends to reduce muzzle velocity and energy. The results of the present study\nare consistent with earlier analysis showing that expansion is necessary to\nmaximize the potential for rapid incapacitation of enemy combatants. In spite\nof some new non-expanding nose designs that moderately increase forces between\nbullet and tissue, the largest retarding forces and highest incapacitation\npotential requires expanding bullets which maximize frontal area.\n",

Enrico\nFermi, however, never published anything on this topic. On the one occasion he\nis known to have mentioned it, he asked 'where is everybody?'- apparently\nsuggesting that we don't see extraterrestrials on Earth because interstellar\ntravel may not be feasible, but not suggesting that intelligent\nextraterrestrial life does not exist, or suggesting its absence is paradoxical.\n  The claim 'they are not here; therefore they do not exist' was first\npublished by Michael Hart, claiming that interstellar travel and colonization\nof the galaxy would be inevitable if intelligent extraterrestrial life existed,\nand taking its absence here as proof that it does not exist anywhere. The Fermi\nparadox appears to originate in Hart's argument, not Fermi's question.\n  Clarifying the origin of these ideas is important, because the Fermi paradox\nis seen by some as an authoritative objection to searching for evidence of\nextraterrestrial intelligence-cited in the U. S. Congress as a reason for\nkilling NASA's SETI program on one occasion-but evidence indicates that it\nmisrepresents Fermi's views, misappropriates his authority, deprives the actual\nauthors of credit, and is not a valid paradox.\n  Keywords: Astrobiology, SETI, Fermi paradox, extraterrestrial life\n",

        "summary": "  In earlier papers, techniques have been described using optical chronographs\nto determine free flight drag coefficients with an accuracy of 1-2%,\naccomplished by measuring near and far velocities of projectiles in flight over\na known distance. Until recently, Doppler radar has been prohibitively\nexpensive for many users. This paper reports results of exploring potential\napplications and accuracy using a recently available, inexpensive (< $600 US)\namateur Doppler radar system to determine drag coefficients for projectiles of\nvarious sizes (4.4 mm to 9 mm diameter) and speeds (M0.3 to M3.0). In many\ncases, drag coefficients can be determined with an accuracy of 1% or better if\nsignal-to-noise ratio is sufficient and projectiles vary little between trials.\nIt is also straightforward to design experiments for determining drag over a\nwide range of velocities. Experimental approaches and limitations are\ndescribed. Overall, the amateur radar system shows greater accuracy, ease of\nuse, and simplicity compared with optical chronographs. Doppler radar has\nadvantages of working well with less accurate projectiles without putting\nequipment at risk of projectile impact downrange. The system can also detect\nphenomena that optical chronographs cannot, such as projectile instability\nresulting in tumbling in flight. This technology may be useful in introductory\nphysics labs, aerodynamics labs, and for accurately determining drag and\nballistic coefficients of projectiles used in military, law enforcement, and\nsporting applications. The most significant limitations are reduced\nsignal-to-noise with smaller projectiles (< 5 mm diameter) and inability to\ndetect projectiles more than 100 m down range.\n",

The strength of this\nsolution depends on the ability for ETIs to come to agreement, and\nestablish/police treaties as part of a so-called \"Galactic Club\". These\nactivities are principally limited by the causal connectivity of a civilisation\nto its neighbours at its inception, i.e. whether it comes to prominence being\naware of other ETIs and any treaties or agreements in place.\n  If even one civilisation is not causally connected to the other members of a\ntreaty, then they are free to operate beyond it and contact the Earth if\nwished, which makes the Zoo solution \"soft\". We should therefore consider how\nlikely this scenario is, as this will give us a sense of the Zoo solution's\nsoftness, or general validity.\n  We implement a simple toy model of ETIs arising in a Galactic Habitable Zone,\nand calculate the properties of the groups of culturally connected\ncivilisations established therein. We show that for most choices of\ncivilisation parameters, the number of culturally connected groups is greater\nthan 1, meaning that the Galaxy is composed of multiple Galactic Cliques rather\nthan a single Galactic Club. We find in our models for a single Galactic Club\nto establish interstellar hegemony, the number of civilisations must be\nrelatively large, the mean civilisation lifetime must be several millions of\nyears, and the inter-arrival time between civilisations must be a few million\nyears or less.\n",

The resulting possibility space can also suggest new search strategies\nand potential targets, one of which is highlighted--that of 'galaxy-scale\nmacro-engineering'. It is hypothesised that an example of this might already be\nknown to us, namely the intriguing galaxy 'Hoag's Object' (PGC54559), and some\nspecific empirical observations are suggested in order to test this hypothesis.\nSome possible extensions to the parameters used, as well as some preliminary\nobservations about modelling the range and extent of human societal responses\nto contact, are also made.\n",

Emerging dual-use technologies, such as biotechnology,\nmay give similar power to thousands or millions of individuals. To\nquantitatively investigate the ramifications of such a marked shift on the\nsurvival of both terrestrial and extraterrestrial technical civilizations, this\npaper presents a two-parameter model for civilizational lifespans, i.e. the\nquantity $L$ in Drake's equation for the number of communicating\nextraterrestrial civilizations. One parameter characterizes the population\nlethality of a civilization's biotechnology and the other characterizes the\ncivilization's psychosociology. $L$ is demonstrated to be less than the inverse\nof the product of these two parameters. Using empiric data from Pubmed to\ninform the biotechnology parameter, the model predicts human civilization's\nmedian survival time as decades to centuries, even with optimistic\npsychosociological parameter values, thereby positioning biotechnology as a\nproximate threat to human civilization. For an ensemble of civilizations having\nsome median calculated survival time, the model predicts that, after 80 times\nthat duration, only one in $10^{24}$ civilizations will survive -- a tempo and\ndegree of winnowing compatible with Hanson's \"Great Filter.\" Thus, assuming\nthat civilizations universally develop advanced biotechnology, before they\nbecome vigorous interstellar colonizers, the model provides a resolution to the\nFermi paradox.\n",

It\nuses, and only needs to use, Schwarzschild metrics and presents some example\nscenarios to demonstrate the concepts through worked examples. Alternatives\nsuch as Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates and Penrose's local collapsing frames\nare not disputed; the Schwarzschild metrics must still be valid outside the\nevent horizon and this paper is largely concerned with \"remote viewers\" for\nvarious meanings of \"remote\".\n  For most astrophysical or cosmological questions the difference between\n\"actual\" and \"nascent\" black holes is largely irrelevant as they behave\nsimilarly for most practical purposes. However the difference becomes critical\nfor effects that require an event horizon to interact with the remote viewer,\nsuch as Hawking-Zel'dovich radiation and the related information problems\noutlined by Susskind.

Presently, over 3500 exoplanets, representing a very wide\nrange of physical and chemical environments, are known. Tardigrades (water\nbears) are microscopic invertebrates that inhabit almost all terrestrial,\nfreshwater and marine habitats, from the highest mountains to the deepest\noceans. Thanks to their ability to live in a state of cryptobiosis, which is\nknown to be an adaptation to unpredictably fluctuating environmental\nconditions, these organisms are able to survive when conditions are not\nsuitable for active life; consequently, tardigrades are known as the toughest\nanimals on Earth. In their cryptobiotic state, they can survive extreme\nconditions, such as temperatures below -250{\\deg}C and up to 150{\\deg}C, high\ndoses of ultraviolet and ionising radiation, up to 30 years without liquid\nwater, low and high atmospheric pressure, and exposure to many toxic chemicals.\nActive tardigrades are also resistant to a wide range of unfavourable\nenvironmental conditions, which makes them an excellent model organism for\nastrobiological studies. In our study, we have established a metric tool for\ndistinguishing the potential survivability of active and cryptobiotic\ntardigrades on rocky-water and water-gas planets in our solar system and\nexoplanets, taking into consideration the geometrical means of surface\ntemperature and surface pressure of the considered planets. The Active\nTardigrade Index (ATI) and Cryobiotic Tardigrade Index (CTI) are two metric\nindices with minimum value 0 (= tardigrades cannot survive) and maximum 1 (=\ntardigrades will survive in their respective state). Values between 0 and 1\nindicate a percentage chance of the active or cryptobiotic tardigrades\nsurviving on a given exoplanet.\n",

Each node explores and serves the local\nstar systems, detecting through its exploration non-technological life, and\nenlisting newly emergent technological civilizations, such as ourselves, into\nits central system. Each node would download information to new member\ncivilizations and upload information from those civilizations, passing it along\nto its immediately adjacent nodes, such that new information would pass through\nthe entire galaxy at near light speed. The most local node would not be\ndirectly detectible by us until it signaled Earth in response to a detection of\nits artificial electromagnetic (EM) leakage. This is because Earth would not be\nin the narrow beam of the signal pathways between our local node and its\nadjacent nodes, nor between the local node and other local civilizations, while\nthe spillover signal strength of far distant nodes would be too weak to be\ndetectable. Thus, the Great Silence of the galaxy is simply the result of the\nfact that Earth is not currently situated within a communications pathway in an\notherwise well interconnected galaxy.\n",

In this, a ground-based\nlaser beam would transmit megawatts of optical power through the atmosphere to\nan arrangement of PV panels mounted on the ascending climber. Although this\ntechnique has been successfully demonstrated in small models, this method will\nlikely suffer from serious shortcomings in a realistic full-scale system,\nincluding poor conversion efficiency, obscuration by clouds, and mechanical\nfragility of the panels. Worse, the PV method provides no means of regenerative\nenergy recovery. Furthermore, the laser would need to operate continuously at\nmulti-megawatt levels for as long as 14 days (the time for the climber to reach\ngeosynchronous altitudes). No such laser has ever been demonstrated.\n  This paper presents a radical alternative method for propelling a space\nelevator car: by using the cable to transmit power in the form of transverse\nmechanical waves propagated on the cable. A ground-based mechanical driving\noscillator would excite the waves. Traveling at hypersonic speeds, the waves\nencounter the climber. This mechanical power is then extracted by an engine in\nthe climber to propel the climber upward. The oscillator may be manifested by a\npair of opposing pistons contacting the cable on opposite sides of the cable,\nnear the anchor point. Most importantly, existing engines can easily provide\nthe required amount of power to send a 10 metric-ton car from the ground to\ngeosynchronous altitudes.\n",

        "summary": "  Launching orbital and suborbital rockets from a high altitude is beneficial\nbecause of e.g. nozzle optimisation and reduced drag. Aeroplanes and gas\nballoons have been used for the purpose. Here we present a concept where a\nballoon is filled with pure water vapour on ground so that it rises to the\nlaunch altitude. The system resembles a gas balloon because no onboard energy\nsource is carried and no hard objects fall down. We simulate the ascent\nbehaviour of the balloon. In the baseline simulation, we consider a 10 tonne\nrocket lifted to an altitude of 18 km. We model the trajectory of the balloon\nby taking into account steam adiabatic cooling, surface cooling, water\ncondensation and balloon aerodynamic drag. The required steam mass proves to be\nonly 1.4 times the mass of the rocket stage and the ascent time is around 10\nminutes. For small payloads, surface cooling increases the relative amount of\nsteam needed, unless insulation is applied to the balloon skin. The\nground-filled steam balloon seems to be an attractive and sustainable method of\nlifting payloads such as rockets into high altitude.\n",

The expectation that the\nuniverse should be teeming with intelligent life is linked to models like the\nDrake equation, which suggest that even if the probability of intelligent life\ndeveloping at a given site is small, the sheer multitude of possible sites\nshould nonetheless yield a large number of potentially observable\ncivilizations. We show that this conflict arises from the use of Drake-like\nequations, which implicitly assume certainty regarding highly uncertain\nparameters. We examine these parameters, incorporating models of chemical and\ngenetic transitions on paths to the origin of life, and show that extant\nscientific knowledge corresponds to uncertainties that span multiple orders of\nmagnitude. This makes a stark difference. When the model is recast to represent\nrealistic distributions of uncertainty, we find a substantial {\\em ex ante}\nprobability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable\nuniverse, and thus that there should be little surprise when we fail to detect\nany signs of it. This result dissolves the Fermi paradox, and in doing so\nremoves any need to invoke speculative mechanisms by which civilizations would\ninevitably fail to have observable effects upon the universe.\n",

Using straightforward calculations, VH75 predicted the \"doomsday\"\nyears for these scenarios (2020-2050), when we as a species should run out of\nspace or food, or induce catastrophic anthropogenic climate change through\nthermodynamically unavoidable direct heating of the planet. Now that over four\ndecades have passed, in this paper we update VH75. We perform similar\ncalculations as that work, with improved data and trends in population growth,\nfood production, energy use, and climate change. For many of the impacts noted\nin VH75 our work amounts to pushing the \"doomsday\" horizon back to the\n2300s-2400s (or much further for population-driven interstellar colonization).\nThis is largely attributable to using worldwide data that exhibit smaller\ngrowth rates of population and energy use in the last few decades. While\npopulation-related catastrophes appear less likely than in VH75, our continued\ngrowth in energy use provides insight into possible future issues. We find\nthat, if historic trends continue, direct heating of the Earth will be a\nsubstantial contributor to climate change by about 2260, regardless of the\nenergy source used, coincident with our transition to a Kardashev type-I\ncivilization. We also determine that either an increase of Earth's global mean\ntemperature of 12K will occur or an unreasonably high fraction of the planet\nwill need to be covered by solar collectors by about 2400 to keep pace with our\ngrowth in energy use. We further discuss the implications in terms of\ninterstellar expansion, the transition to type II and III civilizations, SETI,\nand the Fermi Paradox.

The early concept had two oppositely\nrotating cylinders and moving mirrors to simulate the diurnal cycle. Later, the\nKalpana One concept exhibited passively stable rotation and no large moving\nparts. Here we propose and analyse a specific light transfer solution for\nKalpana One type settlements. Our proposed solution is technically reliable\nbecause it avoids large moving parts that could be single failure points. The\nscheme has an array of cylindrical paraboloid concentrators in the outer wall\nand semi-toroidal reflectors at the equator which distribute the concentrated\nsunlight onto the living surface. The living cylinder is divided into a number\nof $\\varphi$-sections (valleys) that are in different phases of the diurnal and\nseasonal cycles. To reduce the mass of nitrogen needed, a shallow atmosphere is\nused which is contained by a pressure-tight transparent roof. The only moving\nparts needed are local blinders installed below the roof of each valley. We\nalso find that settlements of this class have a natural location at the equator\nwhere one can build multi-storey urban blocks. The location is optimal from the\nmass distribution (rotational stability) point of view. If maximally built, the\namount of urban floorspace per person becomes large, up to 25,000 m$^2$, which\nis an order of magnitude larger than the food-producing rural biosphere area\nper person.

In this paper, by using kinematic\nequations and Newton's laws, it is shown that it is actually impossible for a\nfour-year-old child (and probably for an adult too) to fall from a balcony and\ncatch the railing of the lower balcony.

As the\nspeed increases, a hull capable of planing makes a sharp transition to a\nlifting surface while plowing up the bow wave. As the speed increases further\nthe boat planes, and at a high enough speed buoyancy becomes negligible;\nhydrodynamic lift carries the weight. More generally, any flow past a lifting\nsurface generates a force perpendicular to the flow once the flow separates\nfrom the trailing edge without backflow (without vortex formation). Wings,\nhydrofoils, sails, and propellers are examples of lifting surfaces. The idea of\na planing hull as lifting surface has been discussed inconclusively in the\nliterature. We provide evidence for the onset of lift before planing and also\nproduce an empirically correct lift coefficient for the planing of a v-bottom\n(prismatic shape) hull at high enough speeds that the wet surface area is\nconfined roughly to a triangular shape near the transom. Our model follows our\ncalculation of the lift on a fully submerged delta wing hydrofoil. The lift is\nreduced once the hydrofoil pierces the air-water interface.\n",

Effectuating perfect Mars\nexpedition requires landing of enormous cargoes, crewed modules, ascent\nvehicles, and scientific laboratories. Crash-landing destructs landing modules\ndue to a lack of adequate impact absorbers. Moreover, the existence of\ndeformable shock absorbers like Aluminium honeycomb and carbon fibers within\nlanding gears are defeasible for large-scale mass and crewed landing. Further\nin the EDL scenario, switching of events within a limited span of 5 to 8\nminutes appears to be the most challenging task for landers. Scrutinizing these\nconcerns, we propose a novel impact intriguing system that will be more\nachievable for extensive landing missions. This paper represents the conceptual\ndesign of Mars lander and we expect that subject to any obstruction in EDL\nsequence, this mechanical system will endorse soft-landing in forthcoming\nmissions. Hence our ultimate aim is to protect lander modules and their\ninstruments over the defective landing.\n",

Here the parametric equations versus time are\nderived for the path of P from the superposition of the translational motion of\nthe center of mass (cm) of the disk and the rotational motion of P about this\ncm for r = R (cycloid), r < R (curtate cycloid) and r > R (prolate cycloid). It\nis further shown that the path of P is still a cycloidal function for rolling\nwith frictionless slipping, but where the time dependence of the sinusoidal\nCartesian coordinates of the position of P is modified. In a similar way the\nparametric equations versus time for the orbit with respect to a star of a moon\nin a circular orbit about a planet that is in a circular orbit about a star are\nderived, where the orbits are coplanar. Finally, the general parametric\nequations versus time for the path of the magnetization vector during undamped\nelectron-spin resonance are found, which show that cycloidal paths can occur\nunder certain conditions.\n",

Hanson and Bostrom have proposed that there may be a Great Filter, a\nsurvival challenge so lethal that it prevents virtually all species from\nevolving to an advanced stage. This paper argues that the Great Filter would be\nnot one single factor, but rather simply the statistics of survival in an\nalways-dangerous universe. The frequency of species that survive multiple\nexistential threats would likely obey a power law such as Lotka's Law, such\nthat the frequency of survivors would diminish as an inverse power of the\nnumber of threats. Since any species that advances to the point at which it is\ndetectable on an interstellar scale likely must survive a large number of\nexistential threats, by Lotka's Law the number of such survivors would be a\nvery small fraction of the candidate species that evolve on various planets.\nSome sobering implications of this picture are outlined.\n",

A\nsingle civilisation creating a single SRP is sufficient for a fleet of SRPs to\ngrow and explore the entire Galaxy on timescales much shorter than the age of\nthe Earth - so why do we see no signs of such probes? One solution to this\nParadox suggests that self-replicating probes eventually undergo replication\nerrors and evolve into predator-prey populations, reducing the total number of\nprobes and removing them from our view. I apply Lotka-Volterra models of\npredator-prey competition to interstellar probes navigating a network of stars\nin the Galactic Habitable Zone to investigate this scenario. I find that\ndepending on the local growth mode of both populations and the flow of\npredators/prey between stars, there are many stable solutions with relatively\nlarge numbers of prey probes inhabiting the Milky Way. The solutions can\nexhibit the classic oscillatory pattern of Lotka-Volterra systems, but this\ndepends sensitively on the input parameters. Typically, local and global\nequilibria are established, with prey sometimes outnumbering the predators.\nAccordingly, we find this solution to Fermi's Paradox does not reduce the probe\npopulation sufficiently to be viable.\n",

Van Vleck was the pioneer in applying quantum mechanics\nto the problem of magnetism and we discuss his main contributions: (1) his\ndetailed quantum statistical mechanical study of magnetism of real gases; (2)\nhis pointing out the importance of the crystal fields or ligand fields in the\nmagnetic behavior of iron group salts (the ligand field theory); and (3) his\nmany contributions to the elucidation of exchange interactions in d electron\nmetals. Next, the pioneering contributions (but lesser known) of Dorfman are\ndiscussed. Then, in chronological order, the key contributions of Pauli,\nHeisenberg, and Landau are presented. Finally, we discuss a modern topic of\nquantum spin liquids.\n",

The megalithic constructions date back to\naround 3'200 BC, centuries before the completion of Stonehenge and the Egyptian\npyramids. Passageways inside the mounds have been shown to be aligned such as\nthe rising sun illuminates the interior chambers on the winter solstice at\nNewgrange and around the equinoxes at Knowth. Many of the kerb and interior\nstones are covered with petroglyphs, in particular with spiral motifs. Despite\nseveral attempts to classify and interpret them, they remain enigmatic. Here we\nshow that some of the most elaborated spirals are likely calendrical\nrepresentations. We use a new, 'dynamic' approach adding a temporal dimension\nto the rock art. We identify in the detailed spiral motifs up to five different\nmanifestations of the solar and lunar cycles, which could easily be observed in\nprehistoric Ireland. Corroborating evidence comes from adjacent motifs or a\nspecial location of the stone. Although the work is speculative by nature, many\nclues give confidence in the interpretation. If correct, it would imply that\none or a few individuals developed skills for celestial observations, the\ndesign of complex motifs and their preservation on the rock. This resembles a\nscientific process, but is more likely the expression of a ritual engagement\nwith the sky.\n",

        "summary": "  Egyptian faience is a non-clay ceramic semi-transparent material, formed of a\nquartz core and alkali lime glaze with some cases exhibiting an interaction\nlayer between them. Several possible glazing methods have been identified.\nPrevious investigations have tried to identify the glazing technique by using\nthe microstructure images obtained from polished sections using scanning\nelectron microscope(SEM). Such techniques require sampling which is not\nfeasible on museum collections. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a\nnon-invasive 3D imaging technique, that produces virtual cross sections of\ntransparent and semi-transparent materials. Liang et al. (2012a) investigated\nthe feasibility of using OCT to non-invasively investigate microstructures of\nEgyptian faience, but the limited probing depth of the 930nm OCT prevented\nviewing down to the core of the objects, where the presence of glass was\nthought to be a distinguishing feature between some of the manufacturing\ntechniques, and where the particle size of the quartz may indicate the\ndifference in the raw material. In this paper, a unique longer wavelength OCT\nat 2um is used to scan a number of ancient Egyptian faience objects including\nring and shabti fragments. It was found that the core of the faience could be\nimaged at this longer wavelength, allowing comparisons in all the layers within\nthe microstructure, and leading to discussions about the possible glazing\nmethods. The 2um OCT offers the possibilities of rapid, non invasive imaging of\nfaience microstructure down to the core, allowing comprehensive studies of\nintact objects and large museum collections.\n",

The current paper refines that model,\nspecifying two types of probes or nodes, both part of a communications lattice.\nThe first type of cellular probe (CP) is statically associated with individual\nstars, and the second type is a scout CP that traverses the galaxy surveying\nsuccessive star systems rather than permanently residing within any one of\nthem. CPs would communicate with adjacent CPs and, ultimately, through the\nnetwork of CPs, with their progenitor civilization(s). The question of whether\nOumuamua is such a flyby scout CP is considered.

Yet, no\nsuch technosignatures have been found. Considering the vastness of space,\nfinding such technosignatures has been described as trying to find a needle in\na cosmic haystack. To help resolve this, two hypotheses are proposed to aid\nSETI researchers in narrowing the search for ET technosignatures, based on a\nnetwork analysis approach to locate where in space potential ET communication\nnetworks would most likely be. A potential ET communication network can use\nexoplanets as communication access points (e.g., placing a communication\nsatellite into planetary orbit, or an antenna on a planetary surface). The\napproach uses a topology where exoplanets are represented as nodes, and the\nlines of average distance (generalized communication paths) between adjacent\nexoplanets are represented as edges; the nodes and edges form local and wide\nplanetary networks. Using the approach and data visualization on exoplanet\ndatabases can highlight locations of potential ET communication networks in\nspace. The first hypothesis posits that an ET technosignature would more likely\nappear in a potentially habitable solar system containing a high concentration\nof planets, wherein the planets function as communication access points to\nfacilitate a potential ET communication network. The second hypothesis posits\nthat an ET technosignature would more likely appear in a highly concentrated\ncluster of potentially habitable solar systems. Contributions to the SETI field\ncan be increased accuracy in finding ET technosignatures, increased accuracy in\nreaching a Schelling point (a mutual realization of how we and an ET\nintelligence can find each other), and promoting interdisciplinary SETI\nresearch.\n",

If the mass of the contracting cloud is below certain\nminimum value, instead of a star, a substelar object -- known as a brown dwarf\n-- will form. How much mass is required for a star to form?

Despite their\nemergence in the 1980s, most of these topics remain unexplored. This article\nrevisits some of the key feasibility issues of world ships.

Key roadblocks for world ships are the considerable\nresources required, shifting its economic feasibility beyond the year 2300, and\nthe development of a maintenance system capable of detecting, replacing, and\nrepairing several components per second. The emergence of alternative, less\ncostly modes of crewed interstellar travel at an earlier point in time might\nrender world ships obsolete.\n",

On a velodrome,\nan accurate modelling of power requires a distinction between the trajectory of\nthe wheels and the trajectory of the centre of mass. We formulate and examine\nan individual-pursuit model that takes into account the aforementioned\ndistinction. In doing so, we provide details of the invoked physical principles\nand mathematical derivations, with an emphasis on their limitations. We assume\nthat a velodrome consists of two parallel straights and two semicircular arcs.\nWe neglect the effects of the track inclination along the straights and assume\nthe track inclination along the curves to be constant. For either segment, we\nconsider two distinct black-line speeds. For the latter, the lean-angle\nexpression is derived based on a noninertial frame of the cyclist. Among\nconclusions quantified by this model is the fact that a constant-cadence\napproach to an individual pursuit does not minimize the required power.\n",

From this model the\nforces and torques required to move the club near to impact are calculated. The\nnegative couple near to impact is a robust feature of this model, balancing the\ntorque associated with the force that drives the center of mass of the golf\nclub. The negative couple allows the golfer to maintain a larger radius of\ncurvature of the path of the club head as it moves through impact.\n  Because the negative couple can also serve to reduce the rotational speed of\nthe club, the presence of a negative couple at impact in the golf swing\nmanifests a trade between distance and direction.\n",

In this work, it is argued that since the hypothesis that\nsuch simulations are technically possible remains unproven, then statistical\ncalculations need to consider not just the number of state spaces, but the\nintrinsic model uncertainty. This is achievable through a Bayesian treatment of\nthe problem, which is presented here. Using Bayesian model averaging, it is\nshown that the probability that we are sims is in fact less than 50%, tending\ntowards that value in the limit of an infinite number of simulations. This\nresult is broadly indifferent as to whether one conditions upon the fact that\nhumanity has not yet birthed such simulations, or ignore it.

If we assume that the\nlifetime distribution of intelligences follows an approximately exponential\ndistribution, one might naively assume that the pile-up of short-lived entities\ndominates any detection or contact scenario. However, it is argued here that\nthe probability of contact is proportional to the age of said intelligence (or\npossibly stronger), which introduces a selection effect. We demonstrate that\ndetected intelligences will have a mean age twice that of the underlying\n(detected + undetected) population, using the exponential model. We find that\nour first contact will most likely be with an older intelligence, provided that\nthe maximum allowed mean lifetime of the intelligence population, $\\tau_{\\rm\nmax}$, is $>e$ times larger than our own. Older intelligences may be rare but\nthey disproportionality contribute to first contacts, introducing what we call\na 'contact inequality', analogous to wealth inequality. This reasoning\nformalizes intuitional arguments and highlights that first contact would likely\nbe one-sided, with ramifications for how we approach SETI.\n",

Because intra-settlement travel can be\npropellantless, achieving this goal is possible at least in principle.

GSFR would grow by using in situ materials in order to\nmanufacture machines. The time it takes for GSFR to double it's mass and\nelectric power output is called a doubling period. After about 50 doubling\nperiods, GSFR would become a Dyson Sphere civilization, which can house\n$10^{16}$ people, $10^{19}\\ tons$ of structure and machinery and have a gross\nelectric power of $3 \\cdot 10^{24}\\ W$. GSRF would contain four parts. Electric\npower station would generate electricity for all other parts. Material\nproduction system would gather ores or native metals and produce metals,\nplastic, and propellant. Material shaping and assembly system would shape metal\nand plastic into details. These details would be assembled into machines. These\nmachines would be added to all four parts of GSFR. Space transportation system\nwould use fuel manufactured in situ manufactured in situ in order to facilitate\ntransportation of machinery and astronauts from Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) to the\ncolony. During later stages, space transportation system would also use\nspaceships fully or partially manufactured from space colony material.\n",

It turns out that the\nsame is true here; the hydrogen atom is a little bit lighter than the sum of\nits constituents. This difference corresponds to the ionisation energy of\nhydrogen. This observation allows a simple explanation for how this is\npossible; the destructive interference between the electric fields of the\nproton and electron causes a reduction in the energy of the electric field and\nhence a reduction in the contribution to the mass of the system from the\nelectric field energy. The same explanation can be extended to the nucleus,\nthus giving some intuition about how this mass reduction happens. In the\nprocess, the idea of classical particles being ball-like objects with localised\nproperties, is challenged.\n",

This kind of motion planning and control strategy could bring the\nbiggest advantage into full play in the field of switching tracking for\nmultiple targets, such as the multi-target strike of weapons and the rapid\nmulti-target grabbing of robots on industrial assembly lines. Compared with the\ntime-fuel optimal control that has been studied before, the proposed controller\nretains the advantages of optimal control when switching between multiple\ndynamic targets, and improves the high-frequency oscillation problem of the\nsystem under the discontinuous control strategy. Moreover, the asymmetry of\nfriction load, which can affect the dynamic performance of the system, is also\nconsidered in this brief. Therefore, the novel control law, which is addressed\nby this brief, can make the corresponding system achieve the desired transient\nperformance and satisfactory steady-state performance when switching between\nmultiple dynamic targets.

Basic Newtonian Physics shows\nhow a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole like Gargantua must travel at\n0.25 the speed of light in order to be in a stable orbit. Thus, this orbit is\ntoo far from the black hole to explain the time dilatation observed in Miller's\nPlanet and an the orbit that could explain such a time dilatation is much more\nsmaller that Roche's limit. Furthermore, I explain how enormous waves as\nMiller's Planet ones could appear by studying the tidal potential created by\nGargantua, obtaining a wave of 200 kilometers high, but better results are\nobtained by considering a series of tsunamis in Miller's Planet.

In contradiction to the\nna\\\"ive assumption that the sun always sets latest at the westernmost point,\nthe point of last sunset changes cyclically over the course of a year due to\nthe changing orientation of the axis of the Earth with respect to the sun.\nSpecifically, between the winter and summer solstices the last sunset shifts\nsuccessively from Cabo de Sao Vicente (Portugal) to Cabo da Roca (Portugal) to\nCabo Tourinan (Spain) to a site near Aglapsvik (Norway) to a location in the\nNorwegian municipality of Masoy south of Havoysund; and it shifts back again\nbetween the summer and winter solstices. There are two days in the year (April\n24th and August 18th) on which the last sunset of mainland Europe (shared in\nthose days effectively by Cabo Tourinan and the Aglapsvik area) coincides with\nthe last sunset of mainland Africa, at a site in Western Sahara near Cap Blanc.\nA similar analysis of the first Spanish sunrise shows that from April 22nd to\nAugust 20th it occurs on the Costa Brava at Cap de Creus (Catalonia), and the\nrest of the year at Punta de s'Espero (Balearic Islands), the easternmost point\nof Spain.\n",

Larger p/D\n(pitch to diameter ratio) are more favorable for peak peopeller efficiency and\nhigher speeds; lower p/D are more favorable for carrying loads at low speeds.\nThis conflicts with the common advice to swing as large a diameter as slowly as\npossible but diameter D has dimensions while p/D is dimensionless, and useful\nhydrodynamic recommendations must be given in terms of dimensionless variables.\nFor the surface piercing case I compare my scaling predictions with empirical\ndata using a single case in each class as a baseline. One scaling law allows\npropeller diameter to be predicted from an established baseline where shaft hp\nand shaft RPM are the variables. The second prediction is inferred from Froude\nnr. scaling and allows boat speed to be predicted based on shaft horsepower\n(shp) and weight, given a known baseline in the same class of drag coefficient.\nI also discuss the existing available data on surface piercing propellers and\ncompare the data with both typical competition data and speed records. In the\ncontext of the p/D ratio I discuss the limits on both too high and too low gear\nratios. I state for the first time a basic requirement for setting the leading\nedge camber of surface piercing propellers for optimal acceleration and top\nspeed. I end by using the basic hydrodynamic ideas of circulation conservation\nand vortex stretching to provide a qualitative picture via the tip vortices of\nthe physics of blade ventilation in surface piercing.\n",

Gravitational collapse,\ngeometrization of laws of physics, absence of strong field astronomical tests,\nthe dark components of the universe (Cold Dark Matter (CDM) + Cosmological\nConstant ($\\Lambda$ ) or something similar) and cosmological inflation have not\nonly created serious challenges for the theory but also have ignited\ncontemplation for alternatives and attempts for constraining them through\nobservations.

It then highlights certain\nperspectives from cosmology and quantum gravity, the ultimate applications of\nthe theory. With the advent of modern observing techniques, the theory has been\nexperiencing tug of war with several tests. Our true journey with the theory\nhas started only recently, thanks to the development of gravitational wave\nastronomy and extremely large telescopes some of which are and will be\ndedicated to test the theory by exploring previously uncharted regions of the\nuniverse.

The Planck time,\n$t_{\\rm P}$, is the lowest observable time scale.

        "summary": "  In this paper we present a simple mathematical theory of carving turns in\nalpine skiing and snowboarding. The theory captures the basic dynamics of\ncarving runs and thus provides a useful tool for assessing the potential and\nlimitations of the carving technique. We also apply the model to simulate runs\non slopes of constant gradient and describe the results. We find that pure\ncarving is possible only on relatively flat slopes, with the critical slope\nangle in the range of 8-20 degrees. The exact value depends mostly on the\ncoefficient of snow friction and to a lesser degree on the sidecut radius of\nthe skis. In wiggly carving runs on slopes of subcritical gradient, the\naerodynamic drag force remains relatively unimportant and the speed stops\ngrowing well below the one achieved in fall-line gliding. This is because the\nincreased g-force of carving turns leads to enhanced snow friction which can\nsignificantly exceed the one found in the gliding. At the critical gradient,\nthe g-force of carving turns becomes excessive. For such and even steeper\nslopes only hybrid turns, where at least some part of the turn is skidded, are\npossible. The carving turns of all alpine racing disciplines are approximately\nsimilar. This is because in the dimensionless equations of the model the\nsidecut radius of skis enters only via the coefficient of the aerodynamic drag\nterm, which always remains relatively small. Simple modifications to the model\nare made to probe the roles of skier angulation and skidding at the transition\nphase of hybrid turns. As expected the angulation gives certain control over\nthe turn trajectory, but does not remove the slope limitations.\n",

One theoretically grounded approach is\ntapping the can prior to opening, although this has never been rigorously\nevaluated. We aimed to evaluate the effect of tapping a can of beer on beer\nloss. Methods: Single centre parallel-group randomised controlled trial. 1031\ncans of cans of beer of 330mL were randomised into one of four groups before\nthe experiment: unshaken/untapped (n=256), unshaken/tapped (n=251),\nshaken/untapped (n=249), or shaken/tapped (n=244). The intervention was tapping\nthe can of beer three times on its side with a single finger. We compared\ntapping versus non-tapping for cans that had been shaken for 2 minutes or were\nunshaken. Three teams weighed, tapped or did not tap, opened cans, absorbed any\nbeer loss using paper towels, then re-weighed cans. The teams recorded the mass\nof each can before and after opening with an accuracy of +/-0.01 grams. Main\noutcome measure: The main outcome measure was beer loss (in grams). This was\ncalculated as the difference in the mass of the beer after the can was opened\ncompared to before the can was opened. Results: For shaken cans, there was no\nstatistically significant difference in the mass of beer lost when tapping\ncompared to not tapping (mean difference of -0.159g beer lost with tapping, 95%\nCI -0.36 to 0.04). For unshaken cans, there was also no statistically\nsignificant difference between tapping and not tapping. Conclusion: These\nfindings suggest that tapping shaken beer cans does not prevent beer loss when\nthe container is opened. Thus, the practice of tapping a beer prior to opening\nis unsupported. The only apparent remedy to avoid liquid loss is to wait for\nbubbles to settle before opening the can.\n",

This article considers whether similar fine-tuning of parameters\napplies to technology. The anthropic principle is one means of explaining the\nobserved values of the parameters. This principle constrains physical theories\nto allow for our existence, yet the principle does not apply to the existence\nof technology. Cosmological natural selection has been proposed as an\nalternative to anthropic reasoning. Within this framework, fine-tuning results\nfrom selection of universes capable of prolific reproduction. It was originally\nproposed that reproduction occurs through singularities resulting from\nsupernovae, and subsequently argued that life may facilitate the production of\nthe singularities that become offspring universes. Here I argue technology is\nnecessary for production of singularities by living beings, and ask whether the\nphysics of our universe has been selected to simultaneously enable stars,\nintelligent life, and technology capable of creating progeny. Specific\ntechnologies appear implausibly equipped to perform tasks necessary for\nproduction of singularities, potentially indicating fine-tuning through\ncosmological natural selection. These technologies include silicon electronics,\nsuperconductors, and the cryogenic infrastructure enabled by the thermodynamic\nproperties of liquid helium. Numerical studies are proposed to determine\nregions of physical parameter space in which the constraints of stars, life,\nand technology are simultaneously satisfied. If this overlapping parameter\nrange is small, we should be surprised that physics allows technology to exist\nalongside us. The tests do not call for new astrophysical or cosmological\nobservations.

We\nincorporated a simplified -- yet representative -- model of the whole human\ngenome with 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), containing 2110 building blocks that\nsimulate genetic elements (loci). Each individual is endowed with his/her own\ndiploid genome. Each locus can take 10 different allelic (mutated) forms that\ncan be investigated. To mimic gamete production (sperm and eggs) in human\nindividuals, we simulate the meiosis process including crossing-over and\nunilateral conversions of chromosomal sequences. Mutation of the genetic\ninformation from cosmic ray bombardments is also included. In this first paper\nof a series of two, we use the neutral hypothesis: mutations (genetic changes)\nhave only neutral phenotypic effects (physical manifestations), implying no\nnatural selection on variations. We will relax this assumption in the second\npaper. Under such hypothesis, we demonstrate how the genetic patrimony of\nmulti-generational crews can be affected by genetic drift and mutations. It\nappears that centuries-long deep space travels have small but unavoidable\neffects on the genetic composition/diversity of the traveling populations that\nherald substantial genetic differentiation on longer time-scales if the annual\nequivalent dose of cosmic ray radiation is similar to the Earth radioactivity\nbackground at sea level.

Probability distributions of the\nnumber of ET civilizations in the Galaxy are given, and so is the probable\ndistribution of the distance of ETs from us. 2) Darwinian Evolution is\nre-defined as a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) in the number of living species\non Earth over the last 3.5 billion years. Its mean value grows exponentially in\ntime and Mass Extinctions of the past are accounted for as unpredictable low\nGBM values. 3) The exponential growth of the number of species during Evolution\nis the geometric locus of the peaks of a one-parameter family of lognormal\ndistributions constrained between the time axis and the exponential mean value.\nThis accounts for cladistics. 4) The lifespan of a living being, let it be a\ncell, an animal, a human, a historic human society, or even an ET society, is\nmathematically described as a finite b-lognormal. This author then described\nmathematically the historical development of eight human historic\ncivilizations, from Ancient Greece to the USA, by virtue of b-lognormals. 5)\nThe b-lognormal's entropy is the measure of a civilization's advancement level.\nBy measuring the entropy difference between Aztecs and Spaniards in 1519, this\nauthor was able to account mathematically for the 20-million-Aztecs defeat by a\nfew thousand Spaniards, due to the latter's technological superiority.

The optimum flight path is an arc of a Great\nCircle, specifically that circle which is the result of rotating the equator to\nintersect the origin and destination airports. In order that the velocity\nvector remain parallel to the surface of the spherical earth, a centripetal\nforce is required to rotate the velocity without altering its magnitude. This\nforce must be radially inward and thus parallel to the local vertical. The\nassertion that ``lift balances gravity\" is only an approximation. To follow the\ncurve of the earth, the vertical component of aerodynamic lift must be\n\\emph{slightly weaker} than gravity so that the plane can be in ``orbitfall\".\n  That is, to follow the curvature of the earth, maintaining a constant\ndistance $R$ from the center of the earth while flying at a constant speed $V$\nand generating a vertical lift per unit mass $L$, the plane and all inside it\nmust fall towards the center of the earth with an acceleration, the ``orbitfall\nacceleration\", $g_{orbitfall} \\equiv g-L=V^{2} / R$ where $g$ is the usual\ngravitational acceleration constant. If the plane travels a fraction $\\digamma$\nof the earth's circumference , then it must execute $\\digamma$ of an outside\nloop. This requires that the pitch angle $\\xi$ must rotate nose-down at a rate\nof $d \\xi / dt=V/R$.\n  The dynamic stability of a non-military aircraft makes this pitch change\ncontinuously without pilot intervention: the horizontal stabilizers act as\nweathervanes, suppressing small perturbations so that the longitudinal axis\nremains at a constant angle of attack. Neither pilot nor passenger is aware of\nthe orbitfall or the automatic pitch changes -- physics invisible but\nessential.\n",

The Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) is the D $-$\n$^{3}$He-fueled, aneutronic, thermonuclear fusion propulsion system that is\nunder development at Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory [1]. It is\nconsidered and analyzed the Earth-Mars mission using the DFD. It is shown that\none-way trips to Mars in slightly more than 100 days become possible and also\njourneys to the asteroid belt will take about 250 days [2]. It is presented an\nanalysis of realistic new trajectories for a robotic mission to Saturn's\nlargest moon, Titan, to demonstrate the great advantages related to the\nthermonuclear DFD. The trajectories calculations and analysis for Saturn's\nlargest moon Titan different profile missions are given based on the\ncharacteristics of a 2 MW class DFD engine. This capability results in a total\ntrip duration of 2.6 years for the thrust-coast-thrust profile and less than 2\nyears for the continuous thrust profile [3]. Using the same 2 MW class DFD\nengine one can reach some trans-Neptunian object, such as the dwarf planets\nMakemake, Eris, and Haumea in less than 10 years with a payload mass of at\nleast 1500 kg, so that it would enable all kind of missions, from scientific\nobservation to in-situ operations [4]. We consider for each mission a\nThrust-Coast-Thrust profile. For this reason, each mission is divided into 3\nphases: i. the trajectory to escape Earth gravity influence; ii. the\ninterplanetary travel, from the exit of Earth sphere of influence to the end of\nthe coasting phase; iii. maneuvers to rendezvous with a target object. We\npresent calculations to reach a vicinity at 125 AU.\n",

The reasoning is based on Kelvin's formulation of the second law\nof thermodynamics, and should be accessible to high school students. After\nrecalling some basic facts about the Carnot cycle, we present two very\ndifferent systems that undergo discontinuous phase transitions (ice/water and\nnormal/superconductor), and construct engines that exploit the properties of\nthese systems to produce work. In each case, we show that if the transition\ntemperature $T_tr$ were independent of other parameters, such as pressure or\nmagnetic field, it would be possible to violate Kelvin's principle, i.e., to\nconstruct a perpetuum mobile of the second kind. Since the proposed cyclic\nprocesses can be realized reversibly in the limit of infinitesimal changes in\ntemperature, their efficiencies must be equal to that of an ordinary Carnot\ncycle. We immediately obtain an equation of the form $dT /dX = f(T, X)$, which\ngoverns how the transition temperature changes with the parameter $X$.\n",

Extensions of the same model are discussed and found compatible also\nwith the still hypothetical vulcanoid asteroids versus the transneptunian\nobjects.

Folkes suggests investigators identify landmarks on the ground\nand request human subjects indicate a place in the sky that they perceive to be\nabove that location by raising their arm and pointing. The intersection of a\nvertical line rising out of the landmark and the ray extending from the\nsubject's finger then identifies a point on the subject's model of the\ncelestial vault. When repeated for landmarks covering a range of distances, the\nsubject's entire celestial vault can be traced. We asked 30 subjects to perform\nsuch an identification on a series of points between a horizontal distance of 3\nand 12600 meters across featureless open water in Verplanck and Ithaca, New\nYork. The resulting data are in disagreement with the widely presumed flattened\ndome model, and, in particular, the Size-Distance Invariance Hypothesis.\n  In addition, we find that the vault does not intersect the ground and leaves\nan indeterminate space of about 20 degrees altitude above the horizon with no\ncorrespondence to the ground. It is in this region that the Moon Illusion is\nmost pronounced.\n",

At the brewing level,\nelectrostatic aggregation between particles affects liquid-solid accessibility,\nleading to variable extraction quality. In this study, we quantify the\neffectiveness of four charge mitigation strategies. Our data suggests that\nadding small amounts of water to whole beans pre-grinding, or bombarding the\ngrounds with ions produced from a high-voltage ionizer, are capable of\nde-electrifying the granular flows. While these techniques helped reduce\nvisible mess, only the static reduction through water inclusion was found to\nimpact the brewing parameters in espresso format coffee. There, wetting coffee\nwith less than 0.05 mL / g resulted in a marked shift in particle size\ndistribution, in part due to preventing clump formation and also liberating\nfine particles from sticking to the grinder. With all other variables kept\nconstant, this shift resulted in at least 15% higher coffee concentration for\nespresso extracts prepared from darker roasts. These findings pose financial\nand sustainability implications, and encourage the widespread implementation of\nwater use to de-electrify coffee during grinding.\n",

However, in accordance with the Copernican principle, the\nopposite holds true. Asserting that terrestrial life must differ from other\nforms of life in the universe is, in fact, the geocentric viewpoint. For if\nlife elsewhere is not like terrestrial life, then it is ipso facto different\nlife; more precisely, if terrestrial life does not represent general life, then\nthat life must represent special life, which the principle states it is not.\nThis study employs the Copernican principle as a probability assessment,\naddressing critiques rooted in the implicit assumption of the existence of\ndifferent extraterrestrial forms of life.

Thus, this search seems justifiable as it is known here what one is\nlooking for. However, the Earth-like concept represents an attempt to set up\nsharp boundaries for an inhabited planet, even though nature often comes as\ncontinua. The analyses in this work show that the term does not represent a\nclear-cut entity as a general Earth-likeness cannot be abstracted. Thus, the\ncomplex variation of environment and life means that the singular term\nEarth-like planet is more appropriately treated as a fuzzy world. Such a\nfuzzification has the consequence of the term being not only more limited than\nassumed but may even be deceptive, as an Earth-like planet on one hand can be\nin a segment in which it does not seem particularly Earth-like, but still\npossesses life, but on the other hand can appear very Earth-like but not\npossess life anyway. An atmosphere can provide a biosignature by being\ndisplaced from thermodynamic equilibrium, derived from antagonistic adaptation,\nin which life as a double-edged sword, on one hand, continuously makes the\nexternal environment less favourable for itself, while on the other, increasing\nits capacity to do so. Yet, there is an issue with using this as a search\ncriterion for potentially inhabited worlds, as such planets can give\nimpressions that do not reflect what has gone on; they can even give a ghost\nbiosignature. These novel analyses do not represent a limitation in the search\nfor Earth-like planets, as the plethora of Earth-like planets shows the\npossibility that the number of inhabited worlds can be large, but do represent\na limitation in the search for life on such worlds.\n",

Most Bicycle Power Meters measure only the Average Angular\nVelocity (AAV) of the pedal throughout a given pedal stroke -- only a small\nnumber of power meters compute power using Instantaneous Angular Velocity\n(IAV).

The model allows one to\nefficiently simulate the transitions between free and congested traffic, taking\ninto account congestion-responsive traffic assignment and adaptive traffic\ncontrol. We observe dynamic traffic patterns which significantly depend on the\nrespective network topology. Synchronization is only one interesting example\nand implies the emergence of green waves. In this connection, we will discuss\nadaptive strategies of traffic light control which can considerably improve\nthroughputs and travel times, using self-organization principles based on local\ninteractions between vehicles and traffic lights. Similar adaptive control\nprinciples can be applied to other queueing networks such as production\nsystems. In fact, we suggest to turn push operation of traffic systems into\npull operation: By removing vehicles as fast as possible from the network,\nqueuing effects can be most efficiently avoided. The proposed control concept\ncan utilize the cheap sensor technologies available in the future and leads to\nreasonable operation modes. It is flexible, adaptive, robust, and decentralized\nrather than based on precalculated signal plans and a vulnerable traffic\ncontrol center.\n",

The amount of observer-independent information available in the\nCMB is a small fraction of the total that any observer can measure. Hence a\nlengthy message on the CMB sky is fundamentally no less observer-specific than\na communication hidden in this morning's tea-leaves. Nevertheless, the CMB sky\ndoes encode a wealth of information about the structure of the cosmos and\npossibly about the nature of physics at the highest energy levels.

Phase I is a\nfree fall for the first $H_1\\simeq28$m or $T_1\\simeq2.3$s, during which the\nacceleration $a$ is that of the gravity, $a=g=9.8$m/s$^2$.

We propose that the collapse of WTC 7 is\ninitiated by a total and sudden annihilation of the base (section of the\nbuilding from the ground level to $H_1$), which then allows the top section\n(building above $H_1$) to free fall during Phase I, and then collide with the\nground in Phase II and III.

For fixed power density in the far field, what is the\ncost-optimum interstellar Beacon system? Experience shows an optimum tradeoff,\ndepending on transmission frequency and on antenna size and power. This emerges\nby minimizing the cost of producing a desired effective isotropic radiated\npower, which in turn determines the maximum range of detectability of a\ntransmitted signal. We derive general relations for cost-optimal aperture and\npower. For linear dependence of capital cost on transmitter power and antenna\narea, minimum capital cost occurs when the cost is equally divided between\nantenna gain and radiated power. For non-linear power law dependence a similar\nsimple division occurs. This is validated in cost data for many systems;\nindustry uses this cost optimum as a rule-of-thumb. Costs of pulsed\ncost-efficient transmitters are estimated from these relations using current\ncost parameters ($/W, $/m2) as a basis. Galactic-scale Beacons demand effective\nisotropic radiated power >1017 W, emitted powers are >1 GW, with antenna areas\n> km2. We show the scaling and give examples of such Beacons. Thrifty beacon\nsystems would be large and costly, have narrow searchlight beams and short\ndwell times when the Beacon would be seen by an alien oberver at target areas\nin the sky. They may revisit an area infrequently and will likely transmit at\nhigher microwave frequencies, ~10 GHz. The natural corridor to broadcast is\nalong the galactic spiral radius or along the spiral galactic arm we are in.\nOur second paper argues that nearly all SETI searches to date had little chance\nof seeing such Beacons.\n",

We studied in a companion\npaper how, for fixed power density in the far field, we could build a\ncost-optimum interstellar Beacon system. Here we consider, if someone like us\nwere to produce a Beacon, how should we look for it? High-power transmitters\nmight be built for wide variety of motives other than twoway communication;\nBeacons built to be seen over thousands of light years are such. Altruistic\nBeacon builders will have to contend with other altruistic causes, just as\nhumans do, so may select for economy of effort. Cost, spectral lines near 1 GHz\nand interstellar scintillation favor radiating frequencies substantially above\nthe classic water hole. Therefore the transmission strategy for a distant,\ncost-conscious Beacon will be a rapid scan of the galactic plane, to cover the\nangular space. Such pulses will be infrequent events for the receiver. Such\nBeacons built by distant advanced, wealthy societies will have very different\ncharacteristics from what SETI researchers seek. Future searches should pay\nspecial attention to areas along the galactic disk where SETI searches have\nseen coherent signals that have not recurred on the limited listening time\nintervals we have used. We will need to wait for recurring events that may\narrive in intermittent bursts. Several new SETI search strategies emerge from\nthese ideas. We propose a new test for SETI Beacons, based on the Life Plane\nhypotheses.\n",

However, under commonplace\nassumptions about galactic civilization formation and expansion, this absence\nof observation is highly unlikely. This improbability is the heart of the Fermi\nParadox. The Fermi Paradox leads some to conclude that humans have the only\nadvanced civilization in this galaxy, either because civilization formation is\nvery rare or because intelligent civilizations inevitably destroy themselves.\nIn this paper, we argue that this conclusion is premature by introducing the\n\"Sustainability Solution\" to the Fermi Paradox, which questions the Paradox's\nassumption of faster (e.g. exponential) civilization growth. Drawing on\ninsights from the sustainability of human civilization on Earth, we propose\nthat faster-growth may not be sustainable on the galactic scale. If this is the\ncase, then there may exist ETI that have not expanded throughout the galaxy or\nhave done so but collapsed. These possibilities have implications for both\nsearches for ETI and for human civilization management.\n",

This argument is\ntackled in this work in the context of exploration probes, whose propagation\ncan be faster than that of a colonization wavefront. Extensive computational\nsimulations have been done to build a numerical model of the dynamics of the\nexploration. A probabilistic analysis is subsequently conducted in order to\nobtain bounds on the number of ETCs that may be exploring the galaxy without\nestablishing contact with Earth, depending on factors such as the number of\nprobes they use, their lifetime and whether they leave some long-term imprint\non explored systems or not. The results indicate that it is unlikely that more\nthan ~10^2-10^3 ETCs are exploring the galaxy in a given Myr, if their probes\nhave a lifetime of 50 Myr and contact evidence lasts for 1 Myr. This bound goes\ndown to ~10 if contact evidence lasts for 100 Myr, and is also shown to be\ninversely proportional to the lifetime of probes. These results are interpreted\nin light of the Fermi paradox and are compatible with non-stationary\nastrobiological models in which a few ETCs have gradually appeared in the\nFermi-Hart timescale.\n",

        "summary": "  In this Letter we examine the Multiverse theory and how it relates to the\nAnthropic Principle. Under the supposition of Eternal Inflation, the String\nTheory Landscape (STL) has reinvigorated the discussion of the Anthropic\nPrinciple. The main premise being that the fundamental constants of our\nUniverse are not necessarily of any fundamental physical importance, rather\nthat the specific values are requisite for intelligent life to arise, and\nhence, for intelligent life to measure such constants. STL predicts a multitude\nof other meta-stable Universes with fundamental constants different than our\nown, possibly hinting at some intrinsic specialness of human life. We develop a\ntheoretical framework to prove whether, (1) the Universe we observe must be\nconsistent with the existence of observers, (2) the principle is only\nontological in nature, or (3) if the Anthropic Principle itself is simply a\ntautology.\n",

This in turn is sometimes taken as\nindirect evidence for the improbability of life evolving at all in our\nuniverse. A couple of other possibilities seem worth considering. One is that\nlife capable of evidencing itself on interstellar scales has evolved in many\nplaces but that evolutionary selection, acting on a cosmic scale, tends to\nextinguish species which conspicuously advertise themselves and their habitats.\nThe other is that -- whatever the true situation -- intelligent species might\nreasonably worry about the possible dangers of self-advertisement and hence\nincline towards discretion. These possibilities are discussed here, and some\ncounter-arguments and complicating factors are also considered.\n",

An\nobvious implication is that SRPs produced by extraterrestrial civilizations\nshould have arrived in our solar system millions of years ago, and furthermore,\nthat new probes from an ever-arising supply of civilizations ought to be\narriving on a constant basis. The lack of observations of such probes underlies\na frequently cited variation of the Fermi Paradox. We believe that a\npredilection for ETI-optimistic theories has deterred consideration of\nincompatible theories. Notably, SRPs have virtually disappeared from the\nliterature. In this paper, we consider the most common arguments against SRPs\nand find those arguments lacking. By extension, we find recent models of\ngalactic exploration which explicitly exclude SRPs to be unfairly handicapped\nand unlikely to represent natural scenarios.\n  We also consider several other models that seek to explain the Fermi Paradox,\nmost notably percolation theory and two societal-collapse theories. In the\nformer case, we find that it imposes unnatural assumptions which likely render\nit unrealistic. In the latter case, we present a new theory of interstellar\ntransportation bandwidth which calls into question the validity of\nsocietal-collapse theories.\n  Finally, we offer our thoughts on how to design future SETI programs which\ntake the conclusions of this paper into account to maximize the chance of\ndetection.\n",

Comparing the\nmagnitude of deliberate radio broadcasts intended for messaging to\nextraterrestrial intelligence (METI) with the background radio spectrum of\nEarth, we find that METI attempts to date have much lower detectability than\nemissions from current radio communication technologies on Earth. METI\nbroadcasts are usually transient and several orders of magnitude less powerful\nthan other terrestrial sources such as astronomical and military radars, which\nprovide the strongest detectable signals. The benefits of radio communication\non Earth likely outweigh the potential harms of detection by extraterrestrial\nwatchers; however, the uncertainty regarding the outcome of contact with\nextraterrestrial beings creates difficulty in assessing whether or not to\nengage in long-term and large-scale METI.\n",

The first is what\nmakes applications possible in the first place, many times with a path from\ninception to implementation that is as long and indirect as poorly advertised.\nThe second pillar, public engagement, is mostly regarded as a commodity: if\nthere is good level of funding scientists can consider spending money for\npublic relations otherwise this is the first thing scientists cut because it is\nthe least necessary.

Previous attempts to estimate\nthis travel time have assumed that the probe's motion is simple, moving at a\nconstant maximum velocity, with powered flight producing the necessary change\nin velocity required at each star to complete its chosen trajectory. This\napproach ignores lessons learned from interplanetary exploration, where orbital\nslingshot maneouvres can provide significant velocity boosts at little to no\nfuel cost. It is plausible that any attempt to explore the Galaxy would utilise\nsuch economising techniques, despite there being an upper limit to these\nvelocity boosts, related to the escape velocity of the object being used to\nprovide the slingshot.\n  In order to investigate the effects of these techniques, we present multiple\nrealisations of single probes exploring a small patch of the Milky Way. We\ninvestigate 3 separate scenarios, studying the slingshot effect on trajectories\ndefined by simple heuristics. These scenarios are: i) standard powered flight\nto the nearest unvisited star without using slingshot techniques; ii) flight to\nthe nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to the\nnext unvisited star which provides the maximal velocity boost under a slingshot\ntrajectory.\n  We find that adding slingshot velocity boosts can decrease the travel time by\nup to two orders of magnitude over simple powered flight. In the third case,\nselecting a route which maximises velocity boosts also reduces the travel time\nrelative to powered flight, but by a much reduced factor. From these\nsimulations, we suggest that adding realistic probe trajectories tends to\nstrengthen Fermi's Paradox.\n",

These maneouvres carry little to no extra energy\ncost, and in previous work it has been shown that a single Voyager-like probe\nexploring the galaxy does so 100 times faster when carrying out these\nslingshots than when navigating purely by powered flight (Forgan et al. 2012).\nWe expand on these results by repeating the experiment with self-replicating\nprobes. The probes explore a box of stars representative of the local Solar\nneighbourhood, to investigate how self-replication affects exploration\ntimescales when compared with a single non-replicating probe.\n  We explore three different scenarios of probe behaviour: i) standard powered\nflight to the nearest unvisited star (no slingshot techniques used), ii) flight\nto the nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to\nthe next unvisited star that will give the maximum velocity boost under a\nslingshot trajectory.\n  In all three scenarios we find that as expected, using self-replicating\nprobes greatly reduces the exploration time, by up to three orders of magnitude\nfor scenario i) and iii) and two orders of magnitude for ii). The second case\n(i.e. nearest-star slingshots) remains the most time effective way to explore a\npopulation of stars. As the decision-making algorithms for the fleet are\nsimple, unanticipated \"race conditions\" amongst probes are set up, causing the\nexploration time of the final stars to become much longer than necessary. From\nthe scaling of the probes' performance with star number, we conclude that a\nfleet of self-replicating probes can indeed explore the Galaxy in a\nsufficiently short time to warrant the existence of the Fermi Paradox.\n",

The model described is necessarily\nsimplistic, and the intent is to simply obtain some general insights to inform\nand inspire additional models. We model the relationship between an intelligent\ncivilisation and its host planet as symbiotic, where the the relationship\nbetween the symbiont and the host species (the civilisation and the planets\necology, respectively) determines the fitness and ultimate survival of both\norganisms.\n  We perform a series of Monte Carlo Realisation simulations, where\ncivilisations pursue a variety of different relationships/strategies with their\nhost planet, from mutualism to parasitism, and can consequently 'infect' other\nplanets/hosts. We find that parasitic civilisations are generally less\neffective at survival than mutualist civilisations, provided that interstellar\ncolonisation is inefficient (the maximum velocity of colonisation/infection is\nlow). However, as the colonisation velocity is increased, the strategy of\nparasitism becomes more successful, until they dominate the 'population'. This\nis in accordance with predictions based on island biogeography and r/K\nselection theory.

Here, three\nimplementations of Internet searches for time travelers are described, all\nseeking a prescient mention of information not previously available. The first\nsearch covered prescient content placed on the Internet, highlighted by a\ncomprehensive search for specific terms in tweets on Twitter. The second search\nexamined prescient inquiries submitted to a search engine, highlighted by a\ncomprehensive search for specific search terms submitted to a popular astronomy\nweb site. The third search involved a request for a direct Internet\ncommunication, either by email or tweet, pre-dating to the time of the inquiry.\nGiven practical verifiability concerns, only time travelers from the future\nwere investigated. No time travelers were discovered. Although these negative\nresults do not disprove time travel, given the great reach of the Internet,\nthis search is perhaps the most comprehensive to date.\n",

Work by\nLandis and others has modeled this question in terms of percolation theory and\ncellular automata, using this method to parametrize our ignorance about\npossible other civilizations as a function of the probability of one system to\ncolonize another, and the maximum number of systems reachable from each\nstarting location (i.e. the degree in the network used for percolation). These\nmodels used a fixed lattice of sites to represent a stellar region, so the\ndegree of all sites were identical. In this paper, the question is examined\nagain, but instead of using a pre-determined lattice, the actual physical\npositions of all known star systems within 40 parsecs of the Solar System are\nused as percolation sites; in addition, the number of sites accessible for\nfurther colonization from a given system is determined by a choice of maximum\ndistance such efforts can travel across. The resulting simulations show that\nextraterrestrial colonization efforts may reach the Solar System, but only for\ncertain values of the maximum travel distance and probability of an occupied\nsystem further colonizing other systems. Indeed, large numbers of systems may\nbe colonized with either vessels that lack insufficient travel distance to\nreach the Solar System or else have a colonization probability where they are\nstatistically unlikely to reach us.\n",

These pulses\nmay either consist of signals intentionally directed at the Earth, or signals\nbetween two star systems with a vector that unintentionally intersects the\nSolar System, allowing Earth to intercept the communication. But should we\nexpect to be able to intercept these unintentional signals? And what\nconstraints can we place upon the frequency of intelligent civilisations if we\ndo?\n  We carry out Monte Carlo Realisation simulations of interstellar\ncommunications between civilisations in the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) using\ncollimated beams. We measure the frequency with which beams between two stars\nare intercepted by a third. The interception rate increases linearly with the\nfraction of communicating civilisations, and as the cube of the beam opening\nangle, which is somewhat stronger than theoretical expectations, which we argue\nis due to the geometry of the GHZ. We find that for an annular GHZ containing\n10,000 civilisations, intersections are unlikely unless the beams are\nrelatively uncollimated.\n  These results indicate that optical SETI is more likely to find signals\ndeliberately directed at the Earth than accidentally intercepting collimated\ncommunications. Equally, civilisations wishing to establish a network of\ncommunicating species may use weakly collimated beams to build up the network\nthrough interception, if they are willing to pay a cost penalty that is lower\nthan that meted by fully isotropic beacons. Future SETI searches should\nconsider the possibility that communicating civilisations will attempt to\nstrike a balance between optimising costs and encouraging contact between\ncivilisations, and look for weakly collimated pulses as well as narrow-beam\npulses directed deliberately at the Earth.\n",

We discuss what we believe to be the key\nchallenge raised by the discovery of the Higgs boson, namely determining\nwhether it is elementary or composite, and suggest that the width of the Higgs\nboson might serve as a suitable diagnostic for discriminating between an\nelementary Higgs boson and a composite one.\n",

The\nnon-appropriation principle of the Outer Space Treaty currently prohibits any\nsovereign claims to celestial bodies, but it remains unclear how this principle\nshould be applied to the peaceful colonization of Mars. Here we develop a\npragmatic approach to guide the settlement of Mars, which is based upon a\n\"bounded first possession\" model with mandatory planetary parks. Scientists,\nexperts, and leaders will establish planetary park locations and regulations\nthrough worldwide community solicitation in order to protect sites of\nscientific, aesthetic, historical, cultural, environmental, spiritual value.\nColonization parties may occupy limited plots of martian land and may claim\nexclusive economic rights within this zone, while still refraining from any\nclaims to sovereignty. All colonists remain under the legal jurisdiction of\ntheir host nation, with conflicts to be resolved diplomatically or through a\ntemporary tribunal system composed of representatives from other Mars colonies.\nWe also propose the formation of a Mars Secretariat as an administrative body\nwith limited power to facilitate communication among parties. Our model for\nMars colonization remains consistent with the Outer Space Treaty, but we also\nrecommend revisiting or amending the non-appropriation and province of mankind\nprinciples to resolve the ambiguity of how nations, corporations, and\nindividuals may utilize the resources of space.\n",

The proposed experiment hinges on\nsignals exchanged between Earth and the Orbiter which reveal a time interval of\nsome tens of milliseconds in the future of the Earth which is already in the\npast of the Orbiter. Since this experiment can be performed at any time, and\nsince the magnitude of the time interval can in principle be increased in\nproportion to the distances and speeds over which it is performed, an observer\ncan always be found for whom the past is in the future of another observer. The\nonly explanation that fits these observations is a block universe in which all\nevents in the past, present and future of any observer are equally enfolded\ninto spacetime.\n",

A numerical, statistical analysis was conducted to determine\nwhether this apparent loneliness is, in fact, unexpected. An inequality was\nderived to relate the frequency of life arising and developing technology on a\nsuitable planet in the galaxy, the average length of time since the first\nbroadcast of such a civilization, and a constant term. An analysis of the\nsphere reached thus far by human communication was also conducted, considering\nour local neighborhood and planets of particular interest. We clearly show that\nhuman communication has not reached a number of stars and planets adequate to\nexpect an answer. These analyses both conclude that the Fermi paradox is not,\nin fact, unexpected. By the mediocrity principle and numerical modeling, it is\nactually unlikely that the Earth would have been reached by extraterrestrial\ncommunication at this point. We predict that under 1 percent of the galaxy has\nbeen reached at all thus far, and we do not anticipate to be reached until\napproximately half of the stars/planets have been reached. We offer a\nprediction that we should not expect this until at least 1,500 years in the\nfuture.

This occurs when civilizations are assumed to expand and displace\npossible origination sites for the evolution of life, and estimates are made by\nassuming that humanity has appeared at a typical time.

Earth is an astronomical rarity because\nit is difficult for a planet to present liquid water on the surface. Two\nantagonistic bioethical principles arise: planetary protection and\nterraforming. Planetary protection is based on the fear of interplanetary\ncross-infection and possible ecological damages caused by alien living beings.\nTerraforming is the intention of modifying the environmental conditions of the\nneighbouring planets in such a way that human colonisation would be possible.\nThe synthesis of this antagonism is ecopoiesis, a concept related to the\ncreation of new ecosystems in other planets. Since all the multicellular\nbiodiversity requires oxygen to survive, only extremophile microorganisms could\nsurvive in other planets. So, it could be carried out a simulation of a\nmeteorite by taking to other planets portions of the terrestrial permafrost, or\nocean or soil, so that if a single species could grow, a new ecosystem would\nstart, as well as a new Natural History. As a conclusion, ecopoiesis should be\nthe bioethical principle to guide practices and research in Astrobiology.\n",

On the other hand entropy is defined on a very special set of\nprobability distributions. More specifically the entropy of a thermodynamic\nsystem is related the probability distribution of locations and velocities or\nmomenta of all the particles, which maximized the Shannon Measure of\nInformation. As such, entropy is not a function of time. We also show that the\nH function, as defined by Boltzmann is an SMI but not entropy.

If humanity could\nbuild high-speed interstellar lightsails and reach the alpha Centauri system 20\nyr after launch, would it be better to wait a few years, then take advantage of\nfurther technology improvements to increase the speed, and arrive earlier\ndespite waiting? The risk of being overtaken by a future, faster probe has been\ndescribed earlier as the incentive trap. Based on 211 yr of historical data, we\nfind that the speed growth of human-made vehicles, from steam-driven\nlocomotives to Voyager 1, is much faster than previously believed, about 4.72 %\nannually or a doubling every 15 yr. We derive the mathematical framework to\ncalculate the minimum of the wait time (t) plus travel time (tau(t)) and extend\ntwo exponential growth law models into the relativistic regime. We show that\nthe minimum of t+tau(t) disappears for nearby targets. There is no use of\nwaiting for speed improvements once we can reach an object within about 20 yr\nof travel, irrespective of the actual speed. In terms of speed, the t+tau(t)\nminimum for a travel to alpha Centauri will occur once 19.6 % the speed of\nlight (c) become available, in agreement with the 20 % c proposed by the\nBreakthrough Starshot Initiative. If interstellar travel at 20 % c can be\nobtained within 45 yr from today and if the kinetic energy could be increased\nat a rate consistent with the historical record, then humans can reach the ten\nmost nearby stars within 100 yr from today.\n",

Common examples of superluminal\nmotions that exhibit pair events include Cherenkov radiation, sonic booms,\nillumination fronts from variable light sources, and rotating beams. The\nminimally simple case of pair events from a single massive object is explored\nhere: uniform linear motion. A pair event is perceived when the radial\ncomponent of the object's speed toward the observer drops from superluminal to\nsubluminal. Emission from the pair creation event will reach the observer\nbefore emission from either of the two images created. Potentially observable\nimage pair events are described for sonic booms and Cherenkov light. To date,\nno detection of discrete images following a projectile pair event have ever\nbeen reported, and so the pair event nature of sonic booms and Cherenkov\nradiation, for example, remains unconfirmed. Recent advances in modern\ntechnology have made such pair event tracking feasible. If measured, pair\nevents could provide important information about object distance and history.\n",

Even if M-dwarfs provide more numerous habitable planets\ntoday and in the future, we still expect mid G- to early K-dwarfs stars to be\nthe most likely place for observers like ourselves.

Here we are assuming that the radiation is not produced indefinitely, but\nwithin $L$ as a result of some unknown limiting event. When a civilization\nstops emitting, the radiation continues traveling outward at the speed of\nlight, $c$, but is confined within a shell wall having constant thickness,\n$cL$. We develop a simple model of the Galaxy that includes both the birthrate\nand detectable lifetime of civilizations to compute the possibility of a SETI\ndetection at the Earth. Two cases emerge for radiation shells that are (1)\nthinner than or (2) thicker than the size of the Galaxy, corresponding to\ndetectable lifetimes, $L$, less than or greater than the light-travel time,\n$\\sim 100,000$ years, across the Milky Way, respectively. For case (1), each\nshell wall has a thickness smaller than the size of the Galaxy and intersects\nthe galactic plane in a donut shape (annulus) that fills only a fraction of the\nGalaxy's volume, inhibiting SETI detection. But the ensemble of such shell\nwalls may still fill our Galaxy, and indeed may overlap locally, given a\nsufficiently high birthrate of detectable civilizations. In the second case,\neach radiation shell is thicker than the size of our Galaxy. Yet, the ensemble\nof walls may or may not yield a SETI detection depending on the civilization\nbirthrate. We compare the number of different electromagnetic transmissions\narriving at Earth to Drake's $N$, the number of currently emitting\ncivilizations, showing that they are equal to each other for both cases (1) and\n(2). However, for $L < 100,000$ years, the transmissions arriving at Earth may\ncome from distant civilizations long extinct, while civilizations still alive\nare sending signals yet to arrive.\n",

For understanding\nbroad occurrence and formation rates, large numbers of planets allow for\npopulation statistics to be calculated, and this work preferentially tends\ntowards fainter planets (and fainter host stars) to allow for a large number of\ndetections. The second regime is the detailed understanding of a single planet,\nwith particular consideration to planetary structure and atmosphere, and in\nthis case benefits from finding individual planets (and host stars) that are\nvery close, and subsequently, very bright. The closest of these also provide\nvery novel possibilities for exploration if they are close enough that travel\ntime to them is relatively low, something that would be extremely unlikely for\nmore distant planets. Here, we announce the independent discovery of a\nsub-earth planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a very close solar-mass star\nusing a novel processing technique and observations from the Kilodegree\nExtremely Little Telescope (KELT).\n",

We now turn to addressing an equally important question :\nhow to feed the crew? Dried food stocks are not a viable option due to the\ndeterioration of vitamins with time and the tremendous quantities that would be\nrequired for long-term storage. The best option relies on farming aboard the\nspaceship. Using an updated version of HERITAGE that now accounts for\nage-dependent biological characteristics such as height and weight, and\nfeatures related to the varying number of colonists, such as infertility,\npregnancy and miscarriage rates, we can estimate the annual caloric\nrequirements aboard using the Harris-Benedict principle. By comparing those\nnumbers with conventional and modern farming techniques we are able to predict\nthe size of artificial land to be allocated in the vessel for agricultural\npurposes. We find that, for an heterogeneous crew of 500 people living on an\nomnivorous, balanced diet, 0.45 km2 of artificial land would suffice in order\nto grow all the necessary food using a combination of aeroponics (for fruits,\nvegetables, starch, sugar, and oil) and conventional farming (for meat, fish,\ndairy, and honey).\n",

We explore the problem in a way\nthat avoids assumptions about the intent and motivation of any exo-civilization\nseeking to settle other planetary systems. We first consider the speed of an\nadvancing settlement via probes of finite velocity and range to determine if\nthe galaxy can become inhabited with space-faring civilizations on timescales\nshorter than its age. We also include the effect of stellar motions on the long\nterm behavior of the settlement front which adds a diffusive component to its\nadvance. The results of these models demonstrate that the Milky Way can be\nreadily 'filled-in' with settled stellar systems under conservative assumptions\nabout interstellar spacecraft velocities and launch rates. We then consider the\nquestion of the galactic steady-state achieved in terms of the fraction of\nsettled planets. We do this by considering the effect of finite settlement\ncivilization lifetimes on the steady states. We find a range of parameters for\nwhich the galaxy supports a population of interstellar space-faring\ncivilizations even though some settleable systems are uninhabited. Both results\npoint to ways in which Earth might remain unvisited in the midst of an\ninhabited galaxy. Finally we consider how our results can be combined with the\nfinite horizon for evidence of previous settlements in Earth's geologic record.\nOur steady-state model can constrain the probabilities for an Earth visit by a\nsettling civilization before a given time horizon.

One\nexplanation that has been proposed is that the planet orbits in a Sitnikov\nconfiguration, where two equal-mass stars (or a star and a black hole) orbit\neach other on slightly eccentric orbits, and the planet moves along a line\nthrough the barycenter perpendicular to the primaries' orbital plane\n(Freistetter & Gr\\\"utzbauch 2018). We modify an intermediate-complexity GCM to\ninclude the effects of such an orbit and integrate it for thousands of years to\ndetermine whether such an orbit can a) be habitable and b) explain the climatic\nvariations observed by the inhabitants of Westeros, in both double-star and\nstar-black hole configurations. While configurations with low primary\neccentricity and initial conditions that permit only small excursions from the\necliptic plane are habitable, these orbits are too stable to explain Westerosi\nclimate. We find that while orbits with more bounded chaos are able to produce\nrare anomalously long and cold winters similar to Westeros's Long Night, huge\nvariations in incident stellar flux on normal orbital timescales should render\nthese planets uninhabitable. We note that the presence of an orbital\nmegastructure, either around the planet or the barycenter, could block some of\nthe sunlight during crossings of the primaries' orbital plane and preserve\nWesteros's habitability. While we find that bounded chaotic Sitnikov orbits are\na viable explanation for Westeros's Long Night, we propose that chaotic\nvariations of the planet's axial tilt or semimajor axis, potentially due to\ntorques from nearby planets or stars, may be a more realistic explanation than\nSitnikov orbits.\n",

Whether microtiming deviations (MTDs), i.e. small timing\ndeviations below the bar or phrase level, enhance the feeling of swing is\nhighly debated in the current literature. Studies on other groove related\ngenres did not find evidence for a positive impact of MTDs. The present study\naddresses jazz music and swing in particular, as there is some evidence that\nmicrotiming patterns are genre-specific. We recorded twelve piano jazz\nstandards played by a professional pianist and manipulated the natural MTDs of\nthe recordings in systematic ways by quantizing, expanding and inverting them.\nMTDs were defined with respect to a grid determined by the average swing ratio.\nThe original and manipulated versions were presented in an online survey and\nevaluated by 160 listeners with various musical skill levels and backgrounds.\nAcross pieces the quantized versions (without MTDs) were rated slightly higher\nand versions with expanded MTDs were rated lower with regard to swing than the\noriginal recordings. Unexpectedly, inversion had no impact on swing ratings\nexcept for two pieces. Our results suggest that naturally fluctuating MTDs are\nnot an essential factor for the feeling of swing.\n",

We argue that adopting a\n\"1/8 principle\" is far less restrictive, overall, than it might seem. One\neighth of the iron in the asteroid belt is more than a million times greater\nthan all of the Earth's estimated iron reserves and may suffice for centuries.\nA limit of some sort is needed because of the problems associated with\nexponential growth. Humans are poor at estimating the pace of such growth, so\nthe limitations of a resource are hard to recognize before the final three\ndoubling times which take utilization successively from 1/8 to 1/4 to 1/2, and\nthen to the point of exhaustion. Population growth and climate change are\ninstances of unchecked exponential growth. Each places strains upon ouru\navailable resources. Each is a problem we would like to control but attempts to\ndo so at this comparatively late stage have not been encouraging. Our limited\nability to see ahead suggests that we should set ourselves a 'tripwire' that\ngives us at least 3 doubling times as leeway, i.e. when 1/8 of Solar System\nresources are close to being exploited. At a 3.5 percent growth rate for the\nspace economy, comparable to that of the iron use from the beginning of the\nIndustrial Revolution until now, the 1/8 point would be reached after 400\nyears. At that point the 20 year doubling time of a 3.5 percent growth rate\nmeans that only 60 years would remain to transition the economic system to new\n\"steady state\" conditions. The rationale for adopting the 1/8 principle now is\nthat it may be far easier to implement in principle restrictions at an early\nstage, rather than later, when vested and competing interests have come into\nexistence.\n",

Their identity as a class came in sharp contrast when the Pauli\nexclusion principle and the Dirac equation revealed the other class called\nFermions, obeying `Fermi-Dirac statistics'. Spin, and spin alone, is the\ndetermining factor of the multiparticle behaviour of fundamental quanta. This\nis the basis of the Spin-Statistics Connection. While it is known that the\noverall theoretical picture is consistent, the physical reason for the\nconnection is unknown. Further, the class difference is sensitive only to the\ntotal spin in a quantum aggregate, as spectacularly seen in superconductivity\nand superfluidity, and in the Bose-Einstein condensation of neutral atomic gas.\nCan we grasp the true reason behind the difference in the collective behaviour\nof Bosons and Fermions? An explorer's journey demanding logical and physical\nconsistency of what we already know takes us to the hidden factors in the\nrelation between spin and the statistics of quanta. The surprising answer is in\nthe domain of gravity, that too, on a cosmic scale.\n",

The\nFermi paradox is studied in the terms of a simplified version of the Drake\nformula, through Monte Carlo simulations of N civilizations expanding in the\nGalaxy during their space faring lifetime L. In the framework of that scheme,\nthe probability of \"direct contact\" is determined as the fraction of the\nGalactic volume occupied collectively by the \"spheres of influence\" of N\ncivilizations. The results of the analysis are used to determine regions in the\nparameter space where the Fermi paradox holds. It is argued that in a large\nregion of the diagram the corresponding parameters suggest rather a \"weak\"\nFermi paradox. Future research may reveal whether a \"strong\" paradox holds in\nsome part of the parameter space.

As a way of potentially reaching new\naudiences, SSFX made 8 years of satellite wave recordings audible to the human\near with the aim of using it to create art. Partnering with film industry\nprofessionals, the standard processes of international film festivals were\nadopted by the project in order to challenge independent filmmakers to\nincorporate these sounds into short films in creative ways. Seven films\ncovering a wide array of topics/genres (despite coming from the same sounds)\nwere selected for screening at a special film festival out of 22 submissions.\nThe works have subsequently been shown at numerous established film festivals\nand screenings internationally. These events have attracted diverse non-science\naudiences resulting in several unanticipated impacts upon them, thereby\ndemonstrating how working with the art world can open up dialogues with both\nartists and audiences who would not ordinarily engage with science.\n",

        "summary": "  Self-replicating probes are spacecraft with the capacity to create copies of\nthemselves. Self-replication would potentially allow for an exponential\nincrease in the number of probes and thereby drastically improve the efficiency\nof space exploration. Despite this potential, an integrated assessment of\nself-replicating space probes has not been presented since the 1980s, and it is\nstill unclear how far they are feasible. In this paper, we propose a concept\nfor a partially self-replicating probe for space exploration based on current\nand near-term technologies, with a focus on small spacecraft. The purpose is to\nchart a path towards self-replication with near-term benefits, rather than\nattempting full self-replication. For this reason, components such as\nmicrochips and other microelectronic components are brought with the initial\nprobe and are not replicated. We estimate that such a probe would be capable of\nreplicating 70% of its mass. To further increase this percentage, we identify\ntechnology gaps that are promising to address. We conclude that small-scale,\npartially self-replicating probes are feasible near-term. Their benefits would\nplay out in exploration missions requiring roughly more than a dozen of probes.\n",

We turn to the\nclassification of ETCs for new considerations that may help to design better\nstrategies for ETCs searches. We take a basic taxonomic approach to ETCs and\ninvestigate the implications of the new classification on ETCs observational\npatterns. We use as a counter-example to our qualitative classification the\nquantitative scheme of Kardashev. We propose a classification based on the\nabilities of ETCs to modify their environment and to integrate with it: Class 0\nuses the environment as it is, Class 1 modifies the it to fit its needs, Class\n2 modifies itself to fit the environment and Class 3 ETC is fully integrated\nwith the environment. Combined with the classical Kardashev's scale our scheme\nforms a 2d scheme for interpreting ETC properties. The new framework makes it\nobvious that the available energy is not an unique measure of ETCs, it may not\neven correlate with how well that energy is used. The possibility for progress\nwithout increased energy consumption implies lower detectability, so the\nexistence of a Kardashev Type III ETC in the Milky Way cannot be ruled out.\nThis reasoning weakens the Fermi paradox, allowing the existence of advanced,\nyet not energy hungry, low detectability ETCs. The integration of ETCs with\nenvironment makes it impossible to tell apart technosignatures from natural\nphenomena. Thus, the most likely opportunity for SETI searches is to look for\nbeacons, specifically set up by them for young civilizations like us (if they\nwant to do that is a matter of speculation). The other SETI window is to search\nfor ETCs at technological level close to ours. To rephrase the saying of A.\nClarke, sufficiently advanced civilizations are indistinguishable from nature.\n",

Because Thoroughbred horses are not capable of running\nthe whole race at top speed, determining what pace to set and when to unleash\nthe burst of speed is essential. Our model relies on mechanics, energetics\n(both aerobic and anaerobic) and motor control. It is a system of coupled\nordinary differential equations on the velocity, the propulsive force and the\nanaerobic energy, that leads to an optimal control problem that we solve. In\norder to identify the parameters meaningful for Thoroughbred horses, we use\nvelocity data on races in Chantilly (France) provided by France Galop, the\nFrench governing body of flat horse racing in France. Our numerical simulations\nof performance optimization then provide the optimal speed along the race, the\noxygen uptake evolution in a race, as well as the energy or the propulsive\nforce. It also predicts how the horse has to change its effort and velocity\naccording to the topography (altitude and bending) of the track.\n",

During such a collision the matter is heated up to hundreds of MeV\n(billions of degrees) and compressed to densities of $3-10$ times the density\ninside ordinary atomic nuclei (i.e. $10^{17}-10^{18}$ kg/m$^3$). Usually these\ncollisions are studied via the measurement of a multitude of strongly\ninteracting particles, called hadrons, that are emitted at the end of the\ncollision. However, also some photons are created. These photons are of special\ninterest as they allow to look into the early stage of the collisions, because\nthey are only very weakly (namely only electro-magnetically) interacting with\nthe hadrons of the created fireball. This paper elucidates the physics of the\nphotons and what can be learned from them.\n",

In order to assess\nthe degree of specialty or mediocrity of our trajectory of biospheric\nevolution, we need to take into account recent advances in theoretical\nastrobiology, in particular (i) establishing the history of habitable planets'\nformation in the Galaxy, and (ii) understanding the crucial importance of\n\"Gaian\" feedback loops and temporal windows for the interaction of early life\nwith its physical environment. Hereby we consider an alternative\nmacroevolutionary pathway that may result in tight functional integration of\nall sub-planetary ecosystems, eventually giving rise to a true superorganism at\nthe biospheric level. The blueprint for a possible outcome of this scenario has\nbeen masterfully provided by the great Polish novelist Stanis{\\l}aw Lem in his\n1961 novel Solaris. In fact, Solaris offers such a persuasive and powerful case\nfor an \"extremely strong\" Gaia hypothesis that it is, arguably, high time to\ninvestigate it in a discursive astrobiological and philosophical context. In\naddition to novel predictions in the domain of potentially detectable\nbiosignatures, some additional cognitive and heuristic benefits of studying\nsuch extreme cases of functional integration are briefly discussed.\n",

SGL physics started with Einstein's 1936 paper on the\ngravitational lensing; it was not until 1979 that the idea of a space mission\nreaching the Sun's nearest focal sphere at 550 Astronomical Units (AU) was put\nforward by Von Eshleman. By the year 2000, the senior author of this paper (CM)\nhad submitted a relevant formal proposal to ESA about the relevant space\nmission to 550 AU. He presented his ideas at NASA-JPL for the first time on\nAugust 18. In 2020 NASA awarded a $2million grant to JPL to prepare for the\nfirst FOCAL space mission. But radio bridges between the Sun and any nearby\nstar may also be conceived. The idea is that, if Humanity will be able to send\nunmanned space probes to the nearest stars in the future, each of these probes\ncould be placed behind the star of arrival and along the star-Sun line, thus\nallowing for TWO gravitational lenses to work together. That will result in a\npermanent communication system with much REDUCED POWERS to keep the radio link\nbetween the two stellar systems: a veritable Galactic Internet. In this paper,\nwe study for the first time the 50 radio bridges between the Sun and each of\nthe nearest 100 stars in the Galaxy. Of course, this work is for the centuries\nto come. But knowing which natural radio bridge between the Sun and each of the\nnearest 50 stars is MORE CONVENIENT, will open the ROAD MAP for the HUMAN\nEXPANSION into the Galaxy.\n",

Here, we theoretically and experimentally\ninvestigate the swelling and softening of pasta due to liquid imbibition, as\nwell as the elastic deformation and adhesion of pasta due to capillary force.\nAs water diffuses into the pasta during cooking, it softens gradually from the\noutside inward as starch swells. The softening follows three sequential\nregimes: Regime I shows a slow decrease of modulus with cooking time; Regime\nII, the glassy to rubbery transition region, is characterized by very fast,\nseveral orders of magnitude drop in modulus; and regime III, the rubbery\nregion, has an asymptotic modulus about four orders of magnitude lower than the\nraw pasta. We present experiments and theory to capture these regimes and\nrelate them to the heterogeneous microstructure changes associated with\nswelling. Interestingly, we observe a modulus drop of two orders of magnitude\nwithin the range of 'al dente' cooking duration, and we find the modulus to be\nextremely sensitive to the amount of salt added to the boiling water. While\nmost chefs can gauge the pasta by tasting its texture, our proposed experiment,\nwhich only requires a measurement with a ruler, can precisely provide an\noptimal cooking time finely tuned for various kinds of pasta shapes.\n",

As such, if Hart's thesis is correct then searches for large\nalien civilizations in other galaxies may be fruitful; if it is incorrect, then\nsearches for civilizations within the Milky Way are more likely to succeed than\nHart argued.

It is well known from\nphysiologists that all running exercises of duration less than 3mn are run with\na strong initial acceleration and a decelerating end; on the contrary, long\nraces are run with a final sprint. This can be explained using a mathematical\nmodel describing the evolution of the velocity, the anaerobic energy, and the\npropulsive force: a system of ordinary differential equations, based on\nNewton's second law and energy conservation, is coupled to the condition of\noptimizing the time to run a fixed distance. We show that the monotony of the\nvelocity curve vs time is the opposite of that of the oxygen uptake\n($\\dot{VO2}$) vs time. Since the oxygen uptake is monotone increasing for a\nshort run, we prove that the velocity is exponentially increasing to its\nmaximum and then decreasing. For longer races, the oxygen uptake has an\nincreasing start and a decreasing end and this accounts for the change of\nvelocity profiles. Numerical simulations are compared to timesplits from real\nraces in world championships for 100m, 400m and 800m and the curves match quite\nwell.\n",

To examine the network's ability to\ngeneralize to such a situation beyond specific training scenarios, we use a L2\nregularization term in the cost function and examine performance over a range\nof regularization strengths. In addition, we examine the nonsensical\ndecision-making strategies that emerge in Barry at times when he has recently\nengaged in a fight with his annoying kid sister Janice. To simulate Barry's\ninability to learn efficiently from large mistakes (an observation well\ndocumented by his algebra teacher during sophomore year), we choose a simple\nquadratic form for the cost function, so that the weight update magnitude is\nnot necessary correlated with the magnitude of output error.\n  Network performance on test data indicates that this author would have\nreceived an 87.2 (1)% chance of \"Yes\" given a particular set of environmental\ninput parameters. Most critically, the optimal method of question delivery is\nfound to be Secret Note rather than Verbal Speech. There also exists mild\nevidence that wearing a burgundy mini-dress might have helped. The network\nperforms comparably for all values of regularization strength, which suggests\nthat the nature of noise in a high school hallway during passing time does not\naffect much of anything. We comment on possible biases inherent in the output,\nimplications regarding the functionality of a real biological network, and\nfuture directions. Over-training is also discussed, although the linear algebra\nteacher assures us that in Barry's case this is not possible.\n",

The breadth of tasks\nartificial intelligence could perform on such spacecraft involves maintenance,\ndata collection, designing and constructing an infrastructure using in-situ\nresources. Despite its importance, existing publications on artificial\nintelligence and interstellar travel are limited to cursory descriptions where\nlittle detail is given about the nature of the artificial intelligence. This\narticle explores the role of artificial intelligence for interstellar travel by\ncompiling use cases, exploring capabilities, and proposing typologies, system\nand mission architectures. Estimations for the required intelligence level for\nspecific types of interstellar probes are given, along with potential system\nand mission architectures, covering those proposed in the literature but also\npresenting novel ones. Finally, a generic design for interstellar probes with\nan AI payload is proposed. Given current levels of increase in computational\npower, a spacecraft with a similar computational power as the human brain would\nhave a mass from dozens to hundreds of tons in a 2050-2060 timeframe. Given\nthat the advent of the first interstellar missions and artificial general\nintelligence are estimated to be by the mid-21st century, a more in-depth\nexploration of the relationship between the two should be attempted, focusing\non neglected areas such as protecting the artificial intelligence payload from\nradiation in interstellar space and the role of artificial intelligence in\nself-replication.\n",

This is causing the speeding up (acceleration) of the\nexpansion of the Universe over the past 6 billion years, a discovery recognised\nby the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Coupled with the flatness of the Universe\nand the amount of 30% matter (5% baryonic and 25% Cold Dark Matter), this forms\nthe so-called Lambda-CDM standard model, which has survived many observational\ntests over about 30 years. However, there are currently indications of\ninconsistencies (`tensions' ) within Lambda-CDM on different values of the\nHubble Constant and the clumpiness factor.

We use a techno-economic cost optimization model to investigate a\nstylized case and assess the effects on system cost and electricity supply mix\nof assuming different demand patterns for the models. Our results show that\ndifferences in diurnal demand patterns affect the system cost by less than 3%.\nSimilarly, demand profiles with a flat seasonal variation or a winter peak\nresult in only minor changes in system cost, as compared to the present demand\nprofile. Demand profiles with a summer peak may display a system cost increase\nof up to 8%, whereas the electricity supply mix may differ by a factor of two.\nA more detailed case study is conducted for Europe and the results are\nconsistent with the findings from the stylized case.\n",

The model uses computational power, expressed as\ntransistors per microprocessor, as a key broadly limiting factor for deep space\nmissions' reach and complexity. The goal of this analysis is to provide a\nprojected timeframe for humanity to become a multi-world species through\noff-world colonization, and in so doing all but guarantees the long-term\nsurvival of the human race from natural and human-caused calamities that could\nbefall life on Earth.

If biotic planets are common, putative advanced civilizations\nmay preferentially send probes to planets with technosignatures, such as radio\nbroadcastings. The contact probability is defined as the chance to find a\nnearby civilization located close enough so that it could have detected the\nearliest radio emissions (the radiosphere) and sent a probe that would reach\nthe Solar System at present. It is found that the current contact probability\nfor Earth is very low unless civilizations are extremely abundant. Since the\nradiosphere expands with time, so does the contact probability. The Contact Era\nis defined as the time (since the onset of radio transmissions) at which the\ncontact probability becomes of order unity. At that time alien probes (or\nmessages) become more likely. Unless civilizations are highly abundant, the\nContact Era is shown to be of the order of a few hundred to a few thousand\nyears and may be applied not only to physical probes but also to transmissions\n(i.e. SETI).

The Main Astronomical Observatory of NAS of Ukraine conducts\nan independent study of UAP also. For UAP observations, we used two meteor\nstations installed in Kyiv and in the Vinarivka village in the south of the\nKyiv region. Two-side monitoring of the daytime sky led to the detection of two\nluminous objects at an altitude of 620 and 1130 km, moving at a speed of 256\nand 78 km/s. Colorimetric analysis showed that the objects are dark: B - V =\n1.35, V - R = 0.23. The size of objects is estimated to be more than 100\nmeters. The detection of these objects is an experimental fact. Estimates of\ntheir characteristics follow from observational data. The authors do not\ninterpret these objects. Daytime sky monitoring in Kyiv with multi-color DSLR\ncamera at a rate of 30 frames per second in August and September 2018 and in\nVinarivka with a multi-color CMOS camera in October 2022 revealed several cases\nof dark objects (phantoms). The time of their existence is, as a rule, a\nfraction of a second. These are oval-shaped objects ranging in size from 20 to\n100 meters with speeds from 2 to 30 km/s.\n",

These were not the first time balloon-like objects have\nloomed over Earth, nor are they likely to be the last. This has prompted us to\npush for a better understanding of UFOs. First we demonstrate that the\ndistribution of balloon incidents and other UFO reports are consistent with\nbeing drawn from the same geographic distribution, and further that both of\nthese distributions are consistent with the areas of the Earth that feature the\njet stream. Second we show that there are more UFO sightings during meteor\nshowers, as we would expect if meteor showers, already a known source of\nextraterrestrial material, are being used to provide some manner of distraction\nto help alien craft enter the Earth's atmosphere without drawing undue\nattention.

But the\nlong-term success of space settlement also requires extensions and advances in\nmodels of governance. This paper provides a synthesis of the physical factors\nthat will constrain the application of sovereignty in space as well as legal\nprecedent on Earth that likely applies to any crewed or uncrewed missions to\nother stellar systems. The Outer Space Treaty limits the territorial expansion\nof states into space, but the requirements for oversight of nongovernmental\nagencies and retention of property ownership enable the extension of state\njurisdiction into space. Pragmatic constraints from historical precedent on\nEarth suggest that new space treaties will be unlikely to succeed and new\nglobal space agencies may have limited jurisdiction over states, while hard\nconstraints of the space environment require adherence to technical\ncapabilities, political feasibility, and long-term sustainability. These\nfactors form a three-prong test for assessing the viability of interstellar\ngovernance models.

Finally, in 2018, its light curve showed\nchromaticity more characteristic of the dust (from comets or asteroids) rather\nthan of something made from solid material, but the world was woken up to the\nidea of megastructures. But, in Dyson's time, only Solar System planets were\nknown; it took more than 20 years to realize that nature has no problem making\nplanets and does it with a flair -- the total number of planets in the Galaxy\nis estimated to be in billions. With such abundance of planets, there would be\nno need to destroy the entire planetary system to make one sphere. Instead, a\ncivilization can expand to a system that has planet(s) in the habitable zone\n(HZ), or a planet can be moved into it. Alternatively, a free-floating planet\n(FFP) can be captured and moved into the HZ. These shifts can be performed at a\nconstant low-thrust acceleration using high power directional lasers, resulting\nin a gradual spiral transfer from one orbit to another. We propose here to\nsearch for ETI by looking for high-power laser technosignatures and consider\nmerits of such signatures. We suggest to specifically pay attention to the\nmultiple planetary systems that have Strange Exoplanetary Architectures (SEA) -\nunusual planetary arrangements that cannot be explained by current planetary\nformation theories, because these could be the result of ETI moving planets\nintentionally to suit their needs.\n",

These include static,\ndark energy-dominated, and matter-dominated universes. For all these types of\nuniverses, we find a remarkable fit with the Logistic Growth Function for the\nnumber of colonised planets with time. This is in spite of the fact that for\nthe matter- and dark-energy dominated universes, the space itself is expanding.\nFor the total colonisation time, $T$, the case for a dark energy-dominated\nuniverse is marked with divergence beyond the linear regime characterised by\nsmall values of the Hubble parameter, $H$. Not all planets in a spherical\nsection of this universe can be 'colonised' due to the presence of a shrinking\nHubble sphere. In other words, the recession speeds of other planets go beyond\nthe speed of light making them impossible to reach. On the other hand, for a\nmatter-dominated universe, while there is an apparent horizon, the Hubble\nsphere is growing instead of shrinking. This leads to a finite total\ncolonisation time that depends on the Hubble parameter characterising the\nuniverse; in particular, we find $T\\sim H$ for small $H$ and $T\\sim H^2$ for\nlarge $H$.\n",

In the second part we will use\nthese concepts to explore the curved spacetime geometry of general relativity.\n",

The general perception of\nthe scientific community is that these quantum fluctuations are due to the\nuncertainty principle. Here, we present cogent arguments to show that the\nuncertainty principle is a consequence of the quantum fluctuations, but not\ntheir cause. This poses a conspicuous enigma as to how the universal fields\nremain immutable with an expectation value so accurate that it leads to\nexperimental results, which are precise to one part in a trillion.

The pilot of the series, SUPERPOSITION, is a\n25-minute film about a graduate student in quantum physics at the University of\nChicago. To evaluate the success of this film, it was screened to several\naudiences covering most age groups, and audience members were requested to fill\nout a detailed anonymous survey after the viewing.

It is proposed that such\na filter emerges before these civilisations can develop a stable,\nmultiplanetary existence, suggesting the typical longevity (L) of a technical\ncivilization is less than 200 years. Such estimates for L, when applied to\noptimistic versions of the Drake equation, are consistent with the null results\nobtained by recent SETI surveys, and other efforts to detect various\ntechnosignatures across the electromagnetic spectrum. Through the lens of SETI,\nwe reflect on humanity's current technological trajectory - the modest\nprojections for L suggested here, underscore the critical need to quickly\nestablish regulatory frameworks for AI development on Earth and the advancement\nof a multiplanetary society to mitigate against such existential threats. The\npersistence of intelligent and conscious life in the universe could hinge on\nthe timely and effective implementation of such international regulatory\nmeasures and technological endeavours.\n",

        "summary": "  The momentum of human spaceflight initiatives continues to build toward Mars,\nand technological advances may eventually enable the potential for permanent\nspace settlement. Aspirations for sustaining human life in space must be\npredicated on human factors, rather than technological constraints alone, and\nadvances in models of governance and ethics are necessary as human civilization\nbecomes a spacefaring species. This paper presents an idealistic but feasible\nmodel for economic freedom on Mars, which is situated within a framework in\nwhich Mars has been designated as a sovereign juridical peer to Earth. Under\nsuch conditions, Mars could maintain monetary stability through full reserve\nbanking and a restriction on exchange with any fractional reserve Earth\ncurrencies, with a volume of circulating currency that changes based on the\ntotal population within fixed capacity infrastructure. Mars could maintain\nlong-term political stability by diffusing the ownership of capital on Mars,\nwhich would allow all citizens of Mars to draw sufficient wealth from a\ncombination of capital ownership and labor to live a good life. This model\ncould also support limited tourism on Mars, in which real goods are exchanged\nfor services but currency transactions between planets are prohibited. This\nmodel demonstrates the potential for a viable and sustainable economy on Mars\nthat could conceivably be implemented, including on a sovereign Mars but also\nin other scenarios of space settlement. More broadly, this model illustrates\nthat ideas such as diffuse capital ownership and limited government can enable\nfreedom in space, and numerous models beyond a centralized world space agency\nshould be explored to ensure the optimal governance of the emerging space\neconomy.\n",

The glass is modeled as a body of revolution generated\nby a smooth curve, constructed from a material with negligible thermal\nresistance, but insulated at the base. The ordinary differential equation\ndescribing the problem is derived from the first law of Thermodynamics applied\nto a control volume encompassing the liquid. This is an inverse optimization\nproblem, aiming to find the shape of the glass (represented by curve $S$) that\nminimizes the heat transfer rate. In contrast, the direct problem aims to\ndetermine the heat transfer rate for a given geometry. The solution obtained\nhere is analytic, and the resulting function describing the relation between\nheight ans radius of the glass, is in closed form, providing a family of\noptimal glass shapes that can be manufactured by conventional methods.

        "summary": "  The history of life on Earth and in other potential life-bearing planetary\nplatforms is deeply linked to the history of the universe. Since life as we\nknow it relies on chemical elements forged in dying heavy stars, the universe\nneeds to be old enough for stars to form and evolve. Current cosmological\ntheory indicates that the universe is 13.7$\\pm 0.13$ billion years old and that\nthe first stars formed hundreds of millions of years after the big bang. At\nleast some stars formed with stable planetary systems wherein a set of\nbiochemical reactions leading to life could have taken place. In this lecture,\nI argue that we can divide cosmological history into four ages, from the big\nbang to intelligent life. The Physical Age describes the origin of the\nuniverse, of matter, of cosmic nucleosynthesis, as well as the formation of the\nfirst stars and galaxies. The Chemical Age begun when heavy stars provided the\nraw ingredients for life through stellar nucleosynthesis and describes how\nheavier chemical elements collected in nascent planets and moons to give rise\nto prebiotic biomolecules. The Biological Age describes the origin of early\nlife, its evolution through Darwinian natural selection, and the emergence of\ncomplex multicellular life forms. Finally, the Cognitive Age describes how\ncomplex life evolved into intelligent life capable of self-awareness and of\ndeveloping technology through the directed manipulation of energy and\nmaterials. We conclude discussing whether we are the rule or the exception.\n",

The\nSETI Lottery Bond is a fixed rate perpetual bond with a lottery at maturity,\nwhere maturity occurs only upon discovery and confirmation of extraterrestrial\nintelligent life. Investors in the SETI Lottery Bond purchase shares that yield\na fixed rate of interest that continues indefinitely until SETI succeeds---at\nwhich point a random subset of shares will be awarded a prize from a lottery\npool. SETI Lottery Bond shares also are transferable, so that investors can\nbenefact their shares to kin or trade them in secondary markets. The total\ncapital raised this way will provide a fund to be managed by a financial\ninstitution, with annual payments from this fund to support SETI research, pay\ninvestor interest, and contribute to the lottery fund. Such a plan could\ngenerate several to tens of millions of dollars for SETI research each year,\nwhich would help to revitalize and expand facilities such as the Allen\nTelescope Array. The SETI Lottery Bond is a savings product that only can be\noffered by a financial institution with authorization to engage in banking and\ngaming activities.

A mission\narchitecture mostly based on the Design Reference Architecture 5.0 is assumed\nin order to estimate the mass budget, that influences the performance of the\npropulsion system. Pareto curves of the duration of the mission and time of\nflight versus mass of mission are drawn. We conclude that the ion engine\ntechnology, combined with the classical chemical engine, yields the shortest\nmission times for this architecture with the lowest mass and that chemical\npropulsion alone is the best to minimise travel time. The results obtained\nusing the PEMT suggest that it could be a more suitable solution for farther\ndestinations than Mars.\n",

These\nindeterminacies might permit a close approximation to a property claim or some\nmanner of quasi-property. The recently revealed highly inhomogeneous\ndistribution of lunar resources changes the context of these issues. We\nillustrate this altered situation by considering the Peaks of Eternal Light.\nThey occupy about one square kilometer of the lunar surface. We consider a\nthought experiment in which a Solar telescope is placed on one of the Peaks of\nEternal Light at the lunar South pole for scientific research. Its operation\nwould require nondisturbance, and hence that the Peak remain unvisited by\nothers, effectively establishing a claim of protective exclusion and de facto\nappropriation. Such a telescope would be relatively easy to emplace with todays\ntechnology and so poses a near-term property issue on the Moon. While effective\nappropriation of a Peak might proceed without raising some of the familiar\nproblems associated with commercial development (especially lunar mining), the\npossibility of such appropriation nonetheless raises some significant issues\nconcerning justice and the safeguarding of scientific practice on the lunar\nsurface.

Being such a powerful tool, almost all physical theories can be\nderived from symmetry, and the effectiveness of such an approach is\nastonishing. Since many physicists do not actually believe that symmetry is a\nfundamental feature of nature, it seems more likely it is a fundamental feature\nof human cognition. According to evolutionary psychologists, humans have a\nsensory bias for symmetry. The unconscious quest for symmetrical patterns has\ndeveloped as a solution to specific adaptive problems related to survival and\nreproduction. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that some fundamental concepts\nin psychology and behavioral economics necessarily involve symmetry.

Directed energy launch systems could accelerate\non the other side also crafts weighing several tons to cruising speeds of the\norder of 1000\\,km/s (c/300). At these speeds, superconducting magnetic sails\nwould be able to decelerate the craft by transferring kinetic energy to the\nprotons of the interstellar medium. A tantalizing perspective, which would\nallow interstellar probes to stop whenever time is not a limiting factor. Prime\ncandidates are in this respect Genesis probes, that is missions aiming to offer\nterrestrial life new evolutionary pathways on potentially habitable but\nhitherto barren exoplanets.\n  Genesis missions raise important ethical issues, in particular with regard to\nplanetary protection. Here we argue that exoplanetary and planetary protection\ndiffer qualitatively as a result of the vastly different cruising times for\npayload delivering probes, which are of the order of millennia for interstellar\nprobes, but only of years for solar system bodies. Furthermore we point out\nthat our galaxy may harbor a large number of habitable exoplanets, M-dwarf\nplanets, which could be sterile due to the presence of massive primordial\noxygen atmospheres. We believe that the prospect terrestrial life has in our\ngalaxy would shift on a fundamental level in case that the existence of this\ntype of habitable but sterile oxygen planets will be corroborated by future\nresearch. It may also explain why our sun is not a M dwarf, the most common\nstar type, but a medium-sized G-class star.\n",

We show that even the small pieces of reflective debris in orbit around\nthe Earth can be identified through searches for multiple transients in old\nphotographic plate material exposed before the launch of first human satellite\nin 1957. In order to separate between possible false point-like sources on\nphotographic plates from real reflections, we present calculations to quantify\nthe associated probabilities of alignments. We show that in an image with nine\n\"simultaneous transients\" at least four or five point sources along a line\nwithin a $10 \\ast 10$ arcmin$^{2}$ image box are a strong indicator of NTAs,\ncorresponding to significance levels of $2.5$ to $3.9 \\sigma$. This given\nmethodology can then be applied to set an upper limit to the prevalence of NTAs\nwith reflective surfaces in geosynchronous orbits.\n",

Taking this simple fact\nseriously, I argue that probability theory points towards superdeterminism, a\nprinciple that underlies, notably, 't Hooft's Cellular Automaton Interpretation\nof quantum mechanics. Specifically, I argue that superdeterminism offers a\nsolution for 1) Kolmogorov's problem of probabilistic dependence; 2) the\ninterpretation of the Central Limit Theorem; and 3) Bell's theorem.\nSuperdeterminism's competitor, indeterminism ('no hidden variables'), remains\nentirely silent regarding 1) and 2), and leaves 3) as an obstacle rather than a\nsolution for the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. This\nsuggests that, if one wishes to stick to the standard position in physics and\nadopt the principles with the highest explanatory power, one should adopt\nsuperdeterminism and reject indeterminism.

If probes and planets with technological species exist in more\nthan a handful of systems in our galaxy, it is beneficial to use a coordinated\ncommunication scheme. Due to the inverse square law, data rates decrease\nstrongly for direct connections over long distances.

This argument, often referred to as\nthe Fermi paradox, typically assumes that expansion would proceed uniformly\nthrough the galaxy, but not all stellar types may be equally useful for a\nlong-lived civilization. We suggest that low-mass stars, and K-dwarf stars in\nparticular, would be ideal migration locations for civilizations that originate\nin a G-dwarf system. We use a modified form of the Drake Equation to show that\nexpansion across all low-mass stars could be accomplished in 2 Gyr, which\nincludes waiting time between expansion waves to allow for a close approach of\na suitable destination star. This would require interstellar travel\ncapabilities of no more than ~0.3 ly to settle all M-dwarfs and ~2 ly to settle\nall K-dwarfs. Even more rapid expansion could occur within 2 Myr, with travel\nrequirements of ~10 ly to settle all M-dwarfs and ~50 ly to settle all\nK-dwarfs. The search for technosignatures in exoplanetary systems can help to\nplace constraints on the presence of such a \"low-mass Galactic Club\" in the\ngalaxy today.\n",

While the lack of detection can\nbe attributed to the highly incomplete sampling of the search space,\ntechnological emissions may be actually rare enough that we are living in a\ntime when none cross the Earth. Here we explore the latter possibility and\nderive the likelihood of the Earth not being crossed by signals for at least\nthe last 60 years to infer upper bounds on their rate of emission. Under the\nassumption that technological emitters are distributed uniformly in the Milky\nWay and that they generate technoemissions at a constant rate, we find less\nthan about one to five emissions generated per century with 95% credible level.\nThis implies optimistic waiting times until the next crossing event of no less\nthan 60-1800 years with a 50% probability. A significant fraction of highly\ndirectional signals increases the emission rates upper bounds, but without\nsystematically changing the waiting time. Although these probabilistic bounds\nare derived from a specific model and their validity depends on the model's\nassumptions, they are nevertheless quite robust against weak time dependences\nof the emission rate or nonuniform spatial distributions of the emitters. Our\nresults provide therefore a benchmark for assessing the lack of detection and\nmay serve as a basis to form optimal strategies for the search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence.\n",

The major concentration of the\npaper will be on white dwarf stars although in some places references will also\nbe made to neutron stars where the relations can be extended easily. It can be\nshown that a maximum mass limit is attached to each type of star which can be\nderived rigorously. Maximum entropy can be used to show that the gravitational\ncontraction is balanced by the degeneracy pressure created by the electrons in\nthe case of white dwarfs, and neutrons and protons which constitute the matter\nof the neutron star. Finally the kinetic equations which describe the\nluminosity of the star and the radiative transfer are introduced.\n",
