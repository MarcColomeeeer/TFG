The analysis shows\nthat slow pickup ions may be accelerated at the shock ramp to high energies.\nThe maximum ion energy is determined by the fine structure of the\nelectro-magnetic field at the shock ramp and decreases when the angle between\nmagnetic field and shock normal decreases.

Pitch angle\ndiffusion is relevant for the scattering of electrons into the loss cones, thus\nproviding a source for auroral precipitating electrons. A single whistler mode\nwave propagating parallel to the background magnetic field has resonance with\nthe electrons but the process is not stochastic. The presence of a second,\noppositely directed whistler wave has been shown previously to introduce\nstochasticity into the system, thus enhancing phase space diffusion. Here we\ngeneralise previous work to include relativistic effects. The full relativistic\nLorentz equations are solved numerically to permit application to a more\nextensive parameter space. We consider parameters scaled to intrinsic planetary\nmagnetospheres, for electron populations with 'pancake' velocity distributions\ni.e. large anisotropies in velocity space. We show that the diffusion is rapid,\noccuring on timescales of the order of tens of electron gyroperiods, and is\nstrongly sensitive to the wave amplitude, the wave frequency and the\nperpendicular velocity. Using Voyager 1 data we give an estimate of the\nwhistler wave amplitude in the Io torus at Jupiter and show that the two\nwhistler mechanism produces pitch angle diffusion of up to 10 degrees from an\ninitial pancake distribution, on millisecond timescales.\n",

The particle increases have\nbeen explained variously as due to diffusion from a field line connection with\na CIR at a greater distance, perpendicular diffusion in latitude, propagation\nfrom the inner Corona or an acceleration process on a connecting field line.\nNumerical solutions to the 1-D propagation equation upstream of a CIR shock for\nreasonable diffusion mean free paths are shown here to limit the source of the\nincreases to within about 2 AU of the CIR's, asssuming the CIR's either trap or\naccelerate energetic particles and they diffuse from the nearby CIR interface.\nThe problem of allowing propagation from the CIR's is eased if the CIRs are\nlocated according to the predictions for the current sheet with a solar source\nsurface at $2.5 R_{s}$, rather than at $3.25 R_{s}$. Energetic electron\nobservations showing delays with respect to the CIR-associated ions suggest\npossibly an acceleration in the inner corona, rather than in the CIR-associated\nshock.

Such injections were executed in G-8 and G-10 experiments of the\nCombined Radiation and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) mission. It is shown\nthat the generation of Alfven waves is possible during the total time of plasma\nexpansion. The maximum intensity of these waves corresponds to the time of\ncomplete retardation of the diamagnetic cavity created by the expansion of\nplasma cloud. The Alfven wave exhibits a form of an impulse with an effective\nfrequency ~ 0.03-0.05 Hz. Due to the background conditions and wave frequency,\nthe wave mainly oscillates along the geomagnetic field between the mirror\nreflection points situated at ~ 0.7 ER. The wave amplitude is sufficient to the\ngeneration of plasma instabilities and longitudinal electric field, and to an\nincrease in the longitudinal energy of electrons to ~ 1 keV. These processes\nare the most probable for altitudes ~ 1 ER. The auroral kilometric radiation\n(AKR) at frequencies ~ 100 kHz is associated with these accelerated electrons.\nThe acceleration of electrons and AKR can be observed almost continuously\nduring the first minute and then from time to time with pauses about 35-40 s\ntill 6-8 min after the release. The betatron acceleration of electrons at the\nrecovery of the geomagnetic field is also discussed.

Some of\nthese images showed three distinct ringlets with the outer two displaying a\nkinked and braided appearance. Many models have been proposed to explain the\nbraiding seen in these images; most of these invoke perturbations caused by the\nshepherding moons or km sized moonlets imbedded in the ring and are purely\ngravitational in nature. These models also assume that the plasma densities and\ncharges on the grains are small enough that electromagnetic forces can be\nignored. However, Saturn's magnetic field exerts a significant perturbative\nforce on even weakly charged micron and sub-micron sized grains causing the\ngrains to travel in epicyclic orbits about a guiding center. This study\nexamines the effect of Saturn's magnetic field on the dynamics of micron-sized\ngrains along with gravitational interactions between the F Ring's shepherding\nmoons, Prometheus and Pandora. Due to differences in the charge-to-mass ratios\nof the various sized grains, a phase difference between different size\npopulations is observed in the wavy orbits imposed by passage of the\nshepherding moons.\n",

Since experimentally observed crystals\ncan be comprised of a few hundred particles, this often leads to discrepancies\nbetween predicted theoretical results and experimental data. In addition,\nrecent studies have concentrated on the importance of random charge variations\nbetween individual dust particles, but very little on the importance of size\nvariations between the grains. Such size variations naturally lead to\ninter-grain charge variations which can easily become more important than those\ndue to random charge fluctuations (which are typically less than one percent).\nAlthough such size variations can be largely eliminated experimentally by\nintroducing mono-dispersive particles, many laboratory systems and all\nastrophysical environments contain significant size distributions.

These structures are observed in the Wideband plasma\nwave instrument's waveform data as bipolar and tripolar pulses. These\nstructures are observed at all of the boundary layers, in the solar wind and\nmagnetosheath, and along auroral field lines at 4.5-6.5 Re. Using the Wideband\nwaveform data from the various Cluster spacecraft we have carried out a survey\nof the amplitudes and time durations of these structures and how these\nquantities vary with the local magnetic field strength. Such a survey has not\nbeen carried out before, and it reveals certain characteristics of solitary\nstructures in a finite magnetic field, a topic still inadequately addressed by\ntheories. We find that there is a broad range of electric field amplitudes at\nany specific magnetic field strength, and there is a general trend for the\nelectric field amplitudes to increase as the strength of the magnetic field\nincreases over a range of 5 to 500 nT. We provide a possible explanation for\nthis trend that releates to the structures being Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode\nsolitary waves. There is no corresponding dependence of the duration of the\nstructures on the magnetic field strength, although a plot of these two\nquantities reveals the unexpected result that with the exception of the\nmagnetosheath, all of the time durations for all of the other regions are\ncomparable, wheras the magnetosheath time durations clearly are in a different\ncategory of much smaller time duration.

As in many fluid flow\nsituations, the downstream flow (the convection and drift to the dayside) is an\nimportant boundary condition for the upstream flow (reconnection and inflow\nfrom the tail). Tail-like flux tubes in the near-earth plasma sheet block\ninflow from the tail between reconnection events. However, the westward drift\nof the energetic ions (curvature and gradient drift and ExB drift) removes\nplasma energy from near midnight causing deflation and earthward flow in the\nequatorial plane. (The process can be described as the westward drift of the\neastern of the plasma sheet / partial ring current.) The earthward flow removes\nmagnetic flux and plasma from the center of the thick plasma sheet and creates\na thin current sheet, which, in turn, favors the onset of reconnection. The X\nline forms just tailward of the earthward-flow region. Initially, reconnection\noccurs by the earthward propagation of the X line and the growth of a magnetic\nisland on its tailward side, since there is no downtail flow. Subsequently, the\nsystem evolves towards lobe merging, and the X line propagates tailward\nconsistent with the standard picture of tail reconnection. The east-west width\nof the local-time slot in which inflow and reconnection occur is determined by\nthe scale-length of the decrease in plasma energy at the eastern end of the\ndrifting ions. It is expected that the reconnection slot follows the westward\ndrift of the eastern end of the partial ring current. The model appears to be\nconsistent with bursty bulk flows, the westward traveling surge and many other\nobserved properties of substorms.\n",

In the same event, we observe an enhanced thermal anisotropy and\nplasma beta as well as anti-correlated density and magnetic fluctuations which\nare signatures of mirror mode waves. We perform a superposed epoch analysis of\nACE and Wind plasma and magnetic field data from different classes of ICMEs to\nilluminate the general properties of these regions.

For ICMEs with preceding shocks which are not MCs, plasma\ndepletion and mirror waves are also present but at a reduced level. ICMEs\nwithout shocks are not associated with these features. The differences between\nthe three ICME categories imply that these features depend on the ICME geometry\nand the extent of upstream solar wind compression by the ICMEs.

The cross-section aspect\nratio of the MCs is estimated to be no smaller than $6:1$. We offer a simple\nmodel to extract the radius of curvature of the cross section, based on the\nelevation angle of the MC normal distributed over latitude. Application of the\nmodel to Wind observations from 1995 - 1997 (close to solar minimum) shows that\nthe cross section is bent concavely outward by a structured solar wind with a\nradius of curvature of $\\sim$ 0.3 AU. Near solar maximum, MCs tend to be convex\noutward in the solar wind with a uniform speed; the radius of curvature is\nproportional to the heliographic distance of MCs, as demonstrated by Ulysses\nobservations between 1999 and 2003.

Although such 6x6 correlation matrices have been successfully employed\non previous space missions, they are not physical quantities; because they are\nnot manifestly space-time tensors.

        "summary": "  Geomagnetic activity has two main peaks in the 11-year sunspot cycle caused\nby two types of solar agents: coronal mass ejections and high speed solar wind\nstreams, whose variations in number and intensity are related to the variations\nin solar toroidal and poloidal fields, respectively. From the long-term\nvariations in the lag between the two aa-index peaks we derive the long-term\nvariations in solar meridional circulation. We use these relations to test the\nflux-transport solar dynamo theory and to explain some well known\ncharacteristics of the solar cycle. Based on these relations, we give a\nprediction for the amplitude (125) and epoch of the maximum (April 2011) of\nsunspot cycle 24.\n",

        "summary": "  We have performed a simulation study of Langmuir turbulence in the Earth's\nionosphere by means of a Zakharov model with parameters relevant for the F\nlayer. The model includes dissipative terms to model collisions and Landau\ndamping of the electrons and ions, and a linear density profile, which models\nthe ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity whose length scale is of the order 10--100\nkm. The injection of energy into the system is modeled by a constant source\nterm in the Zakharov equation. Langmuir turbulence is excited ``on-demand'' in\ncontrolled ionospheric modification experiments where the energy is provided by\nan HF radio beam injected into the overhead ionospheric plasma. The ensuing\nturbulence can be studied with radars and in the form of secondary radiation\nrecorded by ground-based receivers. We have analyzed spectral signatures of the\nturbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative to\nthe turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the Langmuir frequency\nequals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived a\nsimple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency\nspectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere. The scaling law provides\na quantitative relation between the physical parameters (temperatures, electron\nnumber density, ionospheric length scale, etc.) and the observed frequency\nspectrum. This law may be useful for interpreting experimental results.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is\nsubject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key\nproperty of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that\norbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.\nThis precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the\nyear to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the\necliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number\nand duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a\ndetailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.\nThis shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10\nhours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per\nmonth at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the\naccumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.\nThus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the\neighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several\nobservations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to\nbombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we\nconclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year\ncycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar\nenvironment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the\ncycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is\nparticularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration\non the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.\n",

Immediately prior to the arrival of each shock,\nelectron beams along the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and associated\nLangmuir waves are detected, implying magnetic connection to a\nquasiperpendicular shock front acceleration site. These observations are\nanalogous to those made in the terrestrial foreshock region, indicating that a\nsimilar foreshock region exists on IP shock fronts. The analogy suggests that\nthe electron acceleration process is a fast Fermi process, and this suggestion\nis borne out by loss cone features in the electron distribution functions. The\npresence of a foreshock region requires nonplanar structure on the shock front.\nUsing Wind burst mode data, the foreshock electrons are analyzed to estimate\nthe dimensions of the curved region. We present the first measurement of the\nlateral, shock-parallel scale size of IP foreshock regions. The presence of\nthese regions on IP shock fronts can explain the fine structure often seen in\nthe spectra of type II bursts.\n",

This interaction is based on momentum balance\nconsiderations. Deformed narrow electron holes cause steep velocity space\ngradients on the ring distribution that lead to intense but narrow band\nemission from their high speed sides and absorption at slightly higher\nfrequency from their low speed sides.

In particular, solar-wind sputtering is one\nof the most important agents for the surface erosion of a Near-Earth Object\n(NEO), acting together with other surface release processes, such as Photon\nStimulated Desorption (PSD), Thermal Desorption (TD) and Micrometeoroid Impact\nVaporization (MIV). The energy distribution of the IS-released neutrals peaks\nat a few eVs and extends up to hundreds of eVs. Since all other release\nprocesses produce particles of lower energies, the presence of neutral atoms in\nthe energy range above 10 eV and below a few keVs (Sputtered High-Energy Atoms\n- SHEA) identifies the IS process. SHEA easily escape from the NEO, due to\nNEO's extremely weak gravity. Detection and analysis of SHEA will give\nimportant information on surface-loss processes as well as on surface elemental\ncomposition. The investigation of the active release processes, as a function\nof the external conditions and the NEO surface properties, is crucial for\nobtaining a clear view of the body's present loss rate as well as for getting\nclues on its evolution, which depends significantly on space weather. In this\nwork, an attempt to analyze the processes that take place on the surface of\nthese small airless bodies, as a result of their exposure to the space\nenvironment, has been realized.

In\naddition, although we detect ro-vibrationally excited nascent molecules\ndesorbing from a bare non-porous (compact) water ice film, we demonstrate that\nthe amount of excited nascent hydrogen molecules is significantly reduced no\nmatter the morphology of the water ice substrate at 10 K (both on non-porous\nand on porous water ice) in a regime of high molecular coverage as is the case\nin dark molecular clouds.\n",

These interplanetary events have been followed outward\nfrom the Sun using plasma and cosmic ray data from Ulysses and Voyagers 1 and\n2. For both intervals of kHz emissions, events originating near the Sun that\nturn out to be the most intense events in this 11-year solar cycle as observed\nby the plasma and cosmic ray variations in the outer heliosphere, reach V1 and\nV2 which are near the heliospheric termination shock at almost the same time\nthat the two kHz radio emissions turn-on. These two events which originate near\nthe Sun about 2003.89 (the 2003 Halloween event) and at 2005.71, are also\nunusual in that they develop solar wind ram pressure waves in the outer\nheliosphere with maximum pressures ~6-8 times the average solar wind pressure\nwhen they reach the heliospheric termination shock. We believe that this study\nsuggests a possible new paradigm for the origin of these latest kHz emissions.\nThis new paradigm is different from the current one describing earlier kHz\nevents. It is related to the strength of these pressure waves in the outer\nheliosphere and involves the arrival of these large pressure waves at the\nheliospheric termination shock rather than the arrival of a shock at the\nheliopause as is the current paradigm.\n",

In\nthis brief review, two types of hazards to Earth-orbiting spacecraft are\ndiscussed: spacecraft charging and radiation hazards to spacecraft electronics,\nwith emphasis on the natural environmental factors and interactions which\ncontribute to these hazards. Following a summary of the historical eras of\nspacecraft charging and some observations from experimental satellites: SCATHA,\nCRRES and DMSP, environmental factors significant to spacecraft charging are\ndiscussed, including plasma interactions, electric and magnetic fields and\nsolar radiation. Spacecraft charging depends on the spacecraft geometry, as\nwell as on the characteristics of its orbit, since the natural environment may\ndiffer for each type of orbit. Low altitude orbiting satellites (LEO) usually\nexperience less charging effects than high altitude geosynchronous (GEO)\nsatellites, except for low altitude polar orbiting satellites which cross the\nauroral oval. Basic mechanisms of surface charging, differential charging and\ninternal charging are described. Environmental factors including trapped and\ntransient radiation, solar and galactic cosmic rays, which can profoundly\ndamage spacecraft electronics are presented. Some effects such as ionization\nand atomic displacement damages to semiconductors and single event phenomena\nare also briefly mentioned.\n",

Dynamic cool coronal structures, on the other hand, are\noften observed to propagate along coronal loops. In this paper, we report on\nthe discovery of two types of dynamic cool coronal structures, and characterize\ntheir fundamental properties. Using the EUV 304 angstrom images from the\nExtreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) telescope on the Solar TErrestrial RElation\nObservatory (STEREO) and the Ca II filtergrams from the Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT) instrument on HINODE, we study the evolution of an EUV arch and the\nkinematics of cool coronal structures. The EUV 304 angstrom observations show\nthat a missile-like plasmoid moves along an arch-shaped trajectory, with an\naverage velocity of 31 km/s. About three hours later, a plasma arch forms along\nthe trajectory, subsequently the top part of the arch fades away and\ndisappears, meanwhile the plasma belonging to the two legs of the arch flows\ndownward to the arch feet. During the arch formation and disappearance, SOT Ca\nII images explore dynamic cool coronal structures beneath the arch. By tracking\nthese structures, we classify them into two types. Type I is threadlike in\nshape and flows downward with a greater average velocity of 72 km/s, finally it\ncombines a loop fibril at chromospheric altitude. Type II is\nshape-transformable and sometimes rolling as it flows downward with a smaller\nvelocity of 37 km/s, then disappears insularly in the chromosphere. It is\nsuggested that the two types of structures are possibly controlled by different\nmagnetic configurations.\n",

There are three ways to alleviate the problem: debris mitigation,\ndebris removal and collision avoidance. This paper addresses collision\navoidance, by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite\nincrease in orbit prediction accuracy. Batch least-squares differential\ncorrection is applied to the publicly available two-line element (TLE) catalog\nof space objects. Using a high-precision numerical propagator, we fit an orbit\nto state vectors derived from successive TLEs. We then propagate the fitted\norbit further forward in time. These predictions are compared to precision\nephemeris data derived from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) for\nseveral satellites, including objects in the congested sun-synchronous orbital\nregion. The method leads to a predicted range error that increases at a typical\nrate of 100 meters per day, approximately a 10-fold improvement over TLE's\npropagated with their associated analytic propagator (SGP4). Corresponding\nimprovements for debris trajectories could potentially provide initial\nconjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable\ncollision avoidance system.\n  We discuss additional optimization and the computational requirements for\napplying all-on-all conjunction analysis to the whole TLE catalog, present and\nnear future.

To investigate this causal relationship, we present results from\nLyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. These simulations are\ndriven with synthetic solar wind input conditions, where idealized ULF dynamic\npressure fluctuations are embedded in the upstream solar wind. In three of the\nsimulations, a monochromatic, sinusoidal ULF oscillation is introduced into the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure time series. In the fourth simulation, a continuum\nof ULF fluctuations over the 0-50 mHz frequency band is introduced into the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure time series. In this numerical experiment, the\nidealized solar wind input conditions allow us to study only the effect of a\nfluctuating solar wind dynamic pressure, while holding all of the other solar\nwind driving parameters constant. We show that the monochromatic solar wind\ndynamic pressure fluctuations drive toroidal mode field line resonances (FLRs)\non the dayside, at locations where the upstream driving frequency matches a\nlocal field line eigenfrequency. In addition, we show that the continuum of\nupstream solar wind dynamic pressure fluctuations drives a continuous spectrum\nof toroidal mode FLRs on the dayside.

Since early 2000's, such probabilities are routinely\ncalculated by two impact monitoring systems (one in the US, the other in\nEurope) on preliminary orbits of newly discovered Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs),\nand are regularly updated whenever additional new astrometric observations for\neach threatening object become available. A typical pattern is that as the\norbit becomes more precisely determined, impact probability often increases\ninitially, but then turns around and decreases until it falls to zero, or some\nvery low number.\n  In the present study we define a probability measure which provides a simple\ntool to evaluate from the very beginning the chance that the impact probability\ncalculated by monitoring systems for a threatening object will reach unity at\nthe end of the overall process of orbit refinement. We stress that this chance\nis independent of the specific (fluctuating) value of the probability\ncalculated by the monitoring systems. In a precise sense, which should be clear\nthroughout the paper, the concrete impact probability of a newly discovered\nasteroid is not that given by the monitoring systems.\n",

While solar radiation can be used to propel the solar\nsail, the absorbed portion of it also gives rise to a drag force in the\ntangential direction. For escape trajectories, this diminishes the cruising\nvelocity, which can have a cumulative effect on the heliocentric distance. For\na solar sail directly facing the sun in a bound orbit, the Poynting-Robertson\neffect decreases its orbital speed, thereby causing it to slowly spiral towards\nthe sun. We also consider this effect for non-Keplerian orbits in which the\nsolar sail is tilted in the azimuthal direction.

The\nmodel magnetic field and ion velocities are in agreement with the measurements.\nThe density and the electron temperature in the central wake are not as well\ncaptured by the model, probably from the lack of electron physics in the hybrid\nmodel.\n",

Ravens was conceived of to fill an important gap in the\nILWS program: global imaging. Ravens will build on the heritage of world-class\nglobal imaging carried out in Canada. It would do much more than provide global\nobservations to complete the system level capabilities of ILWS. Ravens would be\ncomprised of two satellites on elliptical polar orbits, relatively phased on\nthose orbits to provide the first-ever continuous (ie., 24 hours per day 7 days\nper week) global imaging of the northern hemisphere auroral and polar cap\nregions. This would provide the first-ever unbroken sequences of global images\nof the auroral response during long duration geomagnetic processes like storms\nand steady magnetospheric convection events. Ravens could track the\nspatio-temporal evolution of the global electron and proton auroral\ndistribution, and would obtain maps of characteristic energy and energy flux of\nthe precipitating electrons.\n",

However, most instruments are expensive and also restricted to either\nthe bottomside ionosphere or the lower part of the topside ionosphere (usually\nlower than 800 km), such as ground based radar measurements. Nowadays, GPS\nsatellites in high altitude orbits (~20,200 km) are capable of providing\ndetails on the structure of the entire ionosphere, even the plasmasphere. In\nthis paper, a Regional Ionospheric Mapping and Tomography (RIMT) tool was\ndeveloped, which can be used to retrieve 2-D TEC and 3-D ionospheric electron\ndensity profiles using ground-based or space-borne GPS measurements. Some\nresults are presented from the RIMT tool using regional GPS networks in South\nKorea and validated using the independent ionosonde. GPS can provide\ntime-varying ionospheric profiles and information at any specified grid related\nto ionospheric activities and states, including the electron density response\nat the F2-layer peak (the NmF2) during geomagnetic storms.\n",

The STE\nvalues for each Bx, By, Bz IMF time series, with dimension and time delay equal\nto one, were respectively calculated. We found higher STE values in the sheaths\nand zero STE values in some of the three components in most of the MCs (30\namong 41 events). In a physically consistent manner, data windows of 2500\nmagnetic records were selected as the calculation interval for the time series.\nAs not all MCs have zero STE simultaneously, we created a standardization index\n(an entropy index, called as EI) to allow joining the result of the three\ncomponents. With the use of EI three not known MCs were indeed identified and\nthen the MVA method allowed calculating their boundaries. Thus the EI is\nproposed as an auxiliary tool to identify MC candidates based only on IMF\nanalysis.

At higher energies, suprathermal power law tails\nare observed beyond the level predicted by fast Fermi. The SWEA and STE\nelectron detectors on STEREO enable measurements of foreshock electrons with\ngood energy resolution and sensitivity over the entire foreshock beam.

The foreshock electron beam extends up to\nseveral tens of keV, energies for which the Larmor radii of electrons is tens\nof km or greater. These radii are comparable to the scale sizes of the shock,\nand {\\mu} conservation no longer applies.

The radial IMF\ncomponent decreases with the adiabatic power index (|Br| \\sim r^-5/3), the\ntangential component |Bt| \\sim r^-1.1 and, the IMF strength B \\sim r^-1.4.

No MSTIDs were observed either before midnight or when the F-region height\nwas increasing at a relatively high rate, even when these Es layers were\nobserved. Combining this result with AE indices which were relatively high at\nthe time (an average of about 300 nT and maximum of nearly 700 nT), it is\ninferred that both the lack of MSTIDs and the increase in F-region height are\ndue to substorm-induced electric fields. The northeastward-directed MSTIDs were\nstrongest post-midnight during times when the F-region was observed to be\ncollapsing relatively quickly. This implies that these two occurrences are\nrelated and likely both caused by rare shifts in F-region neutral wind\ndirection from southwest to northwest.\n",

We compared our\nresults with the previous estimations that were based on in situ measurements,\nand on solar type III radio and radio science studies made at different phases\nof solar activity and at different solar wind states. Our results are\nconsistent with estimations obtained by these different methods.

The launch of the\nSTEREO twin observatories in October 2006 has greatly increased the number of\nmultipoint studies of ICMEs in the literature, but this field is still in its\ninfancy. To date, most studies continue to use on flux rope models that rely on\nsingle track observations through a vast, multi-faceted structure, which\noversimplifies the problem and often hinders interpretation of the large-scale\ngeometry, especially for cases in which one spacecraft observes a flux rope,\nwhile another does not. In order to tackle these complex problems, new modeling\ntechniques are required. We describe these new techniques and analyze two ICMEs\nobserved at the twin STEREO spacecraft on 22-23 May 2007, when the spacecraft\nwere separated by ~8 degrees. We find a combination of non-force-free flux rope\nmulti-spacecraft modeling, together with a new non-flux rope ICME plasma flow\ndeflection model, better constrains the large-scale structure of these ICMEs.\nWe also introduce a new spatial mapping technique that allows us to put\nmultispacecraft observations and the new ICME model results in context with the\nconvecting solar wind. What is distinctly different about this analysis is that\nit reveals aspects of ICME geometry and dynamics in a far more visually\nintuitive way than previously accomplished. In the case of the 22-23 May ICMEs,\nthe analysis facilitates a more physical understanding of ICME large-scale\nstructure, the location and geometry of flux rope sub-structures within these\nICMEs, and their dynamic interaction with the ambient solar wind.\n",

The interaction resulted in a\nlarge-scale local magnetopause distortion of an\n'expansion-compression-expansion' (ECE) sequence that lasted for 15 min. The\ncompression was caused by a very dense, cold, and fast high-beta magnetosheath\nplasma flow, a so-called plasma jet, whose kinetic energy was approximately\nthree times higher than the energy of the incident solar wind. The plasma jet\nresulted in the effective penetration of the magnetosheath plasma inside the\nmagnetosphere. A strong distortion of the Chapman-Ferraro current in the ECE\nsequence generated a tripolar magnetic pulse 'decrease-peak-decrease' (DPD)\nthat was observed at low and middle latitudes by the INTERMAGNET network of\nground-based magnetometers. The characteristics of the ECE sequence and the\nspatial-temporal dynamics of the DPD pulse were found to be very different from\nany reported patterns of DD interactions within the magnetosphere. The observed\nfeatures only partially resembled structures such as FTE, hot flow anomalies,\nand transient density events. Thus, it is difficult to explain them in the\ncontext of existing models.\n",

        "summary": "  The physics of collisionless shocks is a very broad topic which has been\nstudied for more than five decades. However, there are a number of important\nissues which remain unresolved. The energy repartition amongst particle\npopulations in quasiperpendicular shocks is a multi-scale process related to\nthe spatial and temporal structure of the electromagnetic fields within the\nshock layer. The most important processes take place in the close vicinity of\nthe major magnetic transition or ramp region. The distribution of\nelectromagnetic fields in this region determines the characteristics of ion\nreflection and thus defines the conditions for ion heating and energy\ndissipation for supercritical shocks and also the region where an important\npart of electron heating takes place. All of these processes are crucially\ndependent upon the characteristic spatial scales of the ramp and foot region\nprovided that the shock is stationary. The earliest studies of collisionless\nshocks identified nonlinearity, dissipation, and dispersion as the processes\nthat arrest the steepening of the shock transition. Their relative role\ndetermines the scales of electric and magnetic fields, and so control the\ncharacteristics of processes such as of ion reflection, electron heating and\nparticle acceleration. The purpose of this review is to address a subset of\nunresolved problems in collisionless shock physics from experimental point of\nview making use multi-point observations onboard Cluster satellites. The\nproblems we address are determination of scales of fields and of a scale of\nelectron heating, identification of energy source of precursor wave train, an\nestimate of the role of anomalous resistivity in energy dissipation process by\nmeans of measuring short scale wave fields, and direct observation of\nreformation process during one single shock front crossing.\n",

We use observations of the two STEREO spacecraft\n(s/c) for the first 2.7 years of the mission, along with ground-based\nmeasurements of the solar magnetic field during the unusually long minimum of\nSolar Cycle 23. Due to the unique configuration of the STEREO s/c orbits we are\nable to investigate spatial variations in the intensity of the corotating ions\non time scales of less than one solar rotation. The observations reveal that\nthe occurrence of the strong CIR events was the most frequent at the beginning\nof the period. The inclination of the heliospheric current sheet relative to\nthe heliographic equator (the tilt angle) was quite high in the first stage of\nthe mission and gradually flattened with the time, followed by a decrease in\nthe CIR activity. By examining the differences between measurements on the two\nSTEREO s/c we discuss how the changes in the position of the s/c relative to\nthe CIRs affect the energetic particle observations. We combine STEREO\nobservations with observations from the ULEIS instrument on the ACE s/c and\nargue that the main factor which controls the differences in the ion\nintensities is the latitudinal separation between the two STEREO s/c relative\nto the tilted CIRs. The position of the s/c is less important when the tilt\nangle is high. In this case we found that the CIR ion intensity positively\ncorrelates with the tilt angle.\n",

Minimizing of the Psw\nrequired for GMCs and MSh intervals at various locations, Bz and SYM-H allows\ndescribing both an effect of magnetopause dawn-dusk asymmetry and saturation of\nBz influence for very large southward IMF. The asymmetry is strong for large\nnegative Bz and almost disappears when Bz is positive. We found that the larger\namplitude of negative SYM-H the lower solar wind pressure is required for GMCs.\nWe attribute this effect to a depletion of the dayside magnetic field by a\nstorm-time intensification of the cross-tail current. It is also found that the\nmagnitude of threshold for Bz saturation increases with SYM-H index such that\nfor small negative and positive SYM-H the effect of saturation diminishes.

In first part of the work, using\nthe well known LWPC technique, we simulated the flare induced excess lower\nionospheric electron density by amplitude perturbation method. Unperturbed\nD-region electron density is also obtained from simulation and compared with\nIRI-model results. Using these simulation results and time delay as key\nparameters, we calculate the effective electron recombination coefficient\n($\\alpha_{eff}$) at solar flare peak region. Our results match with the same\nobtained by other established models. In the second part, we dealt with the\nsolar zenith angle effect on D-region during flares. We relate this VLF data\nwith the solar X-ray data. We find that the peak of the VLF amplitude occurs\nlater than the time of the X-ray peak for each flare. We investigate this\nso-called time delay ($\\bigtriangleup t$). For the C-class flares we find that\nthere is a direct correspondence between $\\bigtriangleup t$ of a solar flare\nand the average solar zenith angle $Z$ over the signal propagation path at\nflare occurrence time. Now for deeper analysis, we compute the $\\bigtriangleup\nt$ for different local diurnal time slots $DT$. We find that while the time\ndelay is anti-correlated with the flare peak energy flux $\\phi_{max}$\nindependent of these time slots, the goodness of fit, as measured by\n$reduced$-$\\chi^2$, actually worsens as the day progresses. The variation of\nthe $Z$ dependence of $reduced$-$\\chi^2$ seems to follow the variation of\nstandard deviation of $Z$ along the $T_x$-$R_x$ propagation path.

It is shown that total electron content (TEC) has a tendency to minimize\nbefore the beginning of RGSs and to peak 3 to 4 days after, i.e. on the RGS\nrecovery phase produced by high-intensity long-duration continuous auroral\nactivity. The maximum of TEC coincides with the maximum of solar wind velocity\nwithin high-speed solar wind streams. An analysis of electron content vertical\nprofiles, derived from two independent methods using ionosondes and\nCOSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 radio occultation, showed that in the maximum of an\nionospheric storm on 28 March 2008, the F2 layer thickens, NmF2 increases by\n~50% and hmF2 elevates by a few tens of kilometers. The response of positive\nionospheric storms to solar, heliospheric and geomagnetic drivers reveals a\nprominent longitudinal asymmetry. In the longitudinal range from -90 deg to 90\ndeg, the solar illumination plays a major role, and in the range from 90 deg to\n-120 deg, the influence of heliospheric and geomagnetic drivers becomes\nsignificant. The highest correlations of the TEC enhancements with the\nheliospheric and geomagnetic drivers were found during December - February\nperiod (r increased from ~ 0.3 to ~0.5). We speculate that the dynamics\ncontrolling this might result from an effect of solar zenith angle, storm-time\neffects of thermospheric Sum(O/N2) enhancement, and penetrating electric fields\nof interplanetary and magnetospheric origin.\n",

A geosynchronous relativistic electron\nenhancement (GREE) is determined as daily maximal electron flux exceeding the\nupper root mean square deviation (RMSD) threshold of about 1500 (cm2s sr)-1.\nComparison analysis of the GREE dynamics and geomagnetic conditions on the\nrising phase of current solar cycle revealed suppression of the relativistic\nelectron enhancements by substantially increased strong geomagnetic activity in\nthe solar maximum. Statistical consideration of a relationship between the\nGREEs and the geomagnetic parameters showed that the most important parameters\ncontrolling the geosynchronous relativistic electron enhancements were 4-day\naveraged Kp index, PC index and magnetopause termination distance Rf delayed\nrespectively on 3 and 14 hours. Relatively high averaging time for Kp was\nexplained by cumulative effect of substorm energy release in a gradual\nmechanism accelerating the relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere. Very\nshort time delay for PC index was interpreted as intensification of a fast\nacceleration mechanism producing the GREEs during severe geomagnetic storms.\nSubstantial increase of the PC index (PC>5) was founded as a sufficient\ncondition for GREE occurrence. The fast response of the geosynchronous\nrelativistic electron fluxes on the magnetosphere compression was explained by\ndrift losses of the energetic electrons at the magnetopause which approaches\nthe Earth during geomagnetic storms.\n",

In the example presented here, we have used observations of the\ntotal electron content (TEC) gradient derived from Very Large Array (VLA)\nobservations of synchrotron emission from two galaxy clusters at 330 MHz as\nwell as GPS-based TEC measurements from a sparse array of 33 receivers located\nwithin New Mexico near the VLA.

This is especially true for the GPS data when combining all\navailable satellite/receiver pairs, which probe a larger physical area and\nlikely have a wider variety of measurement errors than in the single-satellite\ncase. In this instance, we found the peak S/N of the detected waves was\nimproved by more than an order of magnitude.

The compression was\nfound to be extremely strong from 1846 to 2035 UT when the dense plasma of fast\nerupting filament produced the solar wind dynamic pressure Pd peaked up to >100\nnPa and, in the first time, the upstream solar wind was observed at\ngeosynchronous orbit during almost 2 hours. Under the extreme compression, the\nouter magnetosphere at L > 5 was pushed inward and the outer radiation belt\nparticles with energies of several tens of keV moved earthward, became\nadiabatically accelerated and accumulated in the inner magnetosphere at L < 4\nthat produced the intensified ring current with an exceptionally long lifetime.\nThe observations were compared with predictions of various empirical and first\nprinciples models. All the models failed to predict the magnetospheric dynamics\nunder the extreme compression when the minimal magnetopause distance was\nestimated to be ~3 Re. The inconsistencies between the model predictions and\nobservations might result from distortions of plasma measurements by extreme\nheliospheric conditions consisting in very fast solar wind streams (~1000 km/s)\nand intense fluxes of solar energetic particles.

Recent statistical\nanalyses based on conditional averaging indicate that near these theoretical\nconstraints the solar wind protons have typically enhanced temperatures and a\nweaker collisionality. Here we carefully analyze the solar wind data and show\nthat these results are a consequence of superposition of multiple correlations\nin the solar wind, namely, they mostly result from the correlation between the\nproton temperature and the solar wind velocity and from the superimposed\nanti-correlation between the proton temperature anisotropy and the proton\nparallel beta in the fast solar wind. Colder and more collisional data are\ndistributed around temperature isotropy whereas hotter and less collisional\ndata have a wider range of the temperature anisotropy anti-correlated with the\nproton parallel beta with signatures of constraints owing to the\ntemperature-anisotropy driven instabilities. However, most of the hot and\nweakly collisional data, including the hottest and least collisional ones, lies\nfar from the marginal stability regions. Consequently, we conclude that there\nis no clear relation between the enhanced temperatures and instability\nconstraints and that the conditional averaging used for these analyses must be\nused carefully and need to be well tested.\n",

The\ngalactic cosmic ray electron and nuclei intensities continue to increase\nrapidly throughout the entire N-heliosheath out to 121.7 AU. Two sudden\nincreases of these electrons at 16.6 and 22.2 AU beyond the HTS suggest that\nthe V1 spacecraft passed significant heliosheath structures at these times.\nLater, at 121.7 AU, which is a distance of 27.6 AU beyond the initial HTS\ncrossing distance, V1 in the N heliosheath appears to pass beyond the ACR\ntrapping region as the anomalous particles disappear suddenly and completely.\nAt V2 in the S heliosheath, large 42-21 day periodic intensity variations were\nobserved for a few MeV particles just beyond the HTS crossing distance at 83.7\nAU and again about a year later when V2 was ~4 AU beyond this shock. These are\nthe dominant features of the energetic particle populations in the inner part\nof the S-heliosheath.

We have\nused data from the IMF GSM-components with time resolution of 16 s. The\nmathematical property chosen was the statistical mean of the wavelet\ncoefficients $(\\langle Dd1 \\rangle)$. The Daubechies wavelet coefficients have\nbeen used because they represent the local regularity present in the signal\nbeing studied. The results reproduced the well-known fact that the dynamics of\nthe sheath region is more than that of the MC region. This technique could be\nuseful to help a specialist to find events boundaries when working with IMF\ndatasets, i.e., a best form to visualize the data. The wavelet coefficients\nhave the advantage of helping to find some shocks that are not easy to see in\nthe IMF data by simple visual inspection. We can learn that fluctuations are\nnot low in all MCs, in some cases waves can penetrate from the sheath to the\nMC. This methodology has not yet been tested to identify some specific\nfluctuation patterns at IMF for any other geoeffective interplanetary events,\nsuch as Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs), Heliospheric Current Sheet\n(HCS) or ICMEs without MC signatures. In our opinion, as is the first time that\nthis technique is applied to the IMF data with this purpose, the presentation\nof this approach for the Space Physics Community is one of the contributions of\nthis work.\n",

The objective of this work is to use\nhistorical data from the Kp index to develop a methodology to make a prediction\nin a time interval of at least three hours. Five different models to forecast\ngeomagnetic indices Kp and ap are tested. Time series of values of Kp index\nfrom 1932 to 15/12/2012 at 21:00 UT are used as input to the models. The\npurpose of the model is to predict the three measured values after the last\nmeasured value of the Kp index (it means the next 9 hours values). The AR model\nprovides the lowest computational cost with satisfactory results. The ARIMA\nmodel is efficient for predicting Kp index during geomagnetic disturbance\nconditions. This paper provides a quick and efficient way to make a prediction\nof Kp index, without using satellite data. Although it is reported that the\nforecast results are better when satellite data are used. In the literature we\nfind that the linear correlation between predicted values and actual values is\n$77\\%$, which is better than the $68.5\\%$ obtained in this work.

Metal\nstructures, while used in space, are subjected to the full spectrum of the\nelectromagnetic radiation together with particle irradiation. Hence, they\nundergo degradation. Future space missions are planned to proceed in the\ninterplanetary space, where the protons of the solar wind play a very\ndestructive role on metallic surfaces. Unfortunately, their real degradation\nbehavior is to a great extent unknown.\n  Our aim is to predict materials' behavior in such a destructive environment.\nTherefore both, theoretical and experimental studies are performed at the\nGerman Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bremen, Germany.\n  Here, we report the theoretical results of those studies. We examine the\nprocess of H2-bubble formation on metallic surfaces. H2-bubbles are metal caps\nfilled with Hydrogen molecular gas resulting from recombination processes of\nthe metal free electrons and the solar protons. A thermodynamic model of the\nbubble growth is presented. Our model predicts e.g. the velocity of that growth\nand the reflectivity of foils populated by bubbles.\n  Formation of bubbles irreversibly changes the surface quality of irradiated\nmetals. Thin metallic films are especially sensitive for such degradation\nprocesses. They are used e.g. in the solar sail propulsion technology. The\nefficiency of that technology depends on the thermo-optical properties of the\nsail materials.

We study the generation\nof differential streaming by wave-particle interactions and absorption of\nturbulent wave spectra. Next we focus on the role of the relative drifts for\nthe turbulent heating and acceleration of ions in the collisionless fast solar\nwind streams. The energy source is given by an initial broad-band spectrum of\nparallel propagating Alfv\\'en-cyclotron waves, which co-exists with the plasma\nand is self-consistently coupled to the perpendicular ion bulk velocities. We\ninclude the effect of a gradual solar wind expansion, which cools and\ndecelerates the minor ions.

In\nthe non-expanding wind, we find a threshold value of the differential streaming\n$V_{\\alpha p} = 0.5 V_\\mathrm{A}$, for which the relative drift speed remains\nnearly steady. For ions, streaming below the threshold value, the waves act to\nincrease the magnitude of the relative drift speed.

The second approach is\nbased on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data. It was suggested that\nparallel mean free path can be expressed in terms of B as in [2]-[4]. Using\ndata of the product of the parallel mean free path and radial gradient of GCR\ncalculated based on the GCR anisotropy data (Ahluwalia et al., this conference\nICRC 2013, poster ID: 487 [5]), we estimate the temporal changes of the radial\ngradient of GCR at the Earth orbit.

A number of different solar wind phenomena have been studied over the\npast forty years with the intention of understanding and forecasting solar\nbehavior. One of these phenomena in particular, Earth-bound interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs), can significantly disturb the Earth's\nmagnetosphere for a short time and cause geomagnetic storms. This publication\npresents a mission concept consisting of six spacecraft that are equally spaced\nin a heliocentric orbit at 0.72 AU. These spacecraft will monitor the plasma\nproperties, the magnetic field's orientation and magnitude, and the\n3D-propagation trajectory of CMEs heading for Earth. The primary objective of\nthis mission is to increase space weather (SW) forecasting time by means of a\nnear real-time information service, that is based upon in-situ and remote\nmeasurements of the aforementioned CME properties. The mission's secondary\nobjective is to provide vital data to update scientific models. In-situ\nmeasurements are performed using a Solar Wind Analyzer instrumentation package\nand flux gate magnetometers, while coronagraphs execute remote measurements.\nCommunication with the six identical spacecraft is realized via a deep space\nnetwork consisting of six ground stations. They provide an information service\nthat is in uninterrupted contact with the spacecraft, allowing for continuous\nSW monitoring. The data will be handled by a dedicated processing center before\nbeing forwarded to the SSA Space Weather Coordination Center who will manage\nthe SW forecasting. The data processing center will additionally archive the\ndata for the scientific community. The proposed concept mission allows for\nmajor advances in SW forecasting time and the scientific modelling of SW.\n",

The\narrangement of sub-systems provide a handy way to optimize the unbalanced EM\nforce with the concept of impedance matching.

Nineteen of these complex events were associated with an intense\ngeomagnetic storm (peak Dst under $-100$ nT) within 12 hours of the shock\ndetection at Wind, and fifteen were associated with a drop of the storm-time\nDst index of more than 50 nT between 3 and 9 hours after shock detection.

As most of these shocks\nare measured in the back half of a CME, we conclude that about half the shocks\nmay not remain fast-mode shocks as they propagate through an entire CME due to\nthe large upstream and magnetosonic speeds.\n",

To take into account the different durations of SW\ntypes, we use the double superposed epoch analysis (DSEA) method: re-scaling\nthe duration of the interval for all types in such a manner that, respectively,\nbeginning and end for all intervals of selected type coincide. As the analyzed\nSW types can interact with each other and change parameters as a result of such\ninteraction, we investigate separately 8 sequences of SW types: (1) CIR, (2)\nIS/CIR, (3) Ejecta, (4) Sheath/Ejecta, (5) IS/Sheath/Ejecta, (6) MC, (7)\nSheath/MC, and (8) IS/Sheath/MC. The main conclusion is that the behavior of\nparameters in Sheath and in CIR are very similar both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. Both the high-speed stream (HSS) and the fast ICME play a role\nof pistons which push the plasma located ahead them. The increase of speed in\nHSS and ICME leads at first to formation of compression regions (CIR and\nSheath, respectively), and then to IS.

This\nsimply implies that fractal is a shape that it would still look the same even\nif somebody could zoom in on one of its parts an infinite number of times. This\nproperty is also called self-similarity with several applications including\nnano pharmacology and drug nano carriers. We are interested in the study of the\nproperties of fractal aggregates in a microgravity environment above an\norbiting spacecraft. To model the effect we use a complete expression for the\ngravitational acceleration. In particular on the surface of the Earth the\nacceleration is corrected for the effect of oblateness and rotation. In the\ngravitational acceleration the effect of oblateness can be modeled with the\ninclusion of a term that contains the J2 harmonic coefficient, as well as a\nterm that depends on the square of angular velocity of the Earth. In orbit the\nacceleration of gravity at the point of the spacecraft is a function of the\norbital elements and includes only in our case the J2 harmonic since no\ncoriolis force is felt by the spacecraft. Using the fitting parameter d = 3.0\nwe have found that the aggregate monomer number N is not significantly affected\nand exhibits a minute 0.0001% difference between the geocentric and areocentric\nlatitudes of 90 degrees and 0 degrees. Finally for circular and elliptical\norbits around Earth and Mars of various inclinations and eccentricities the\naggregate monomer number is not affected at all at the orbital altitude of 300\nkm.\n",

To this end, the dfferences in the modulation\nbrought about by each of three choices for the heliospheric magnetic field,\ni.e. the unmodified Parker field, the Smith-Bieber modified field, and the\nJokipii-Kota modified field, are studied. It is illustrated that both the\nJokipii-Kota and Smith-Bieber modifications are effective in modifying the\nParker field in the polar regions. In addition, it is argued that the\nmodification of Smith and Bieber is based on observational evidence and has a\nfirm physical basis, while these motivations are lacking in the case of the\nJokipii-Kota modification. From a cosmic ray modulation point of view, we found\nthe Smith-Bieber modification to be the most suitable choice for modifying the\nheliospheric magnetic field. The features and effects of these three\nmodifications are illustrated both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is also\nshown how the Smith-Bieber modified field can be applied in cosmic ray\nmodulation models to reproduce observational cosmic ray proton spectra from the\nPAMELA mission during the solar minimum of 2006 - 2009.

Three cases are presented in this study: two inclined oblique shocks,\nhere after IOS-1 and IOS-2, where the latter has a Mach number twice stronger\nthan the former. Both shocks have impact angles of 30$^o$ in relation to the\nSun-Earth line. Lastly, we choose a frontal perpendicular shock, FPS, whose\nshock normal is along the Sun-Earth line, with the same Mach number as IOS-1.\nWe find that, in the IOS-1 case, due to the north-south asymmetry, the\nmagnetotail is deflected southward, leading to a mild compression. The\ngeomagnetic activity observed in the nightside ionosphere is then weak. On the\nother hand, in the head-on case, the FPS compresses the magnetotail from both\nsides symmetrically. This compression triggers a substorm allowing a larger\namount of stored energy in the magnetotail to be released to the nightside\nionosphere, resulting in stronger geomagnetic activity. By comparing IOS-2 and\nFPS, we find that, despite the IOS-2 having a larger Mach number, the FPS leads\nto a larger geomagnetic response in the nightside ionosphere. As a result, we\nconclude that IP shocks with similar upstream conditions, such as magnetic\nfield, speed, density, and Mach number, can have different geoeffectiveness,\ndepending on their shock normal orientation.\n",

We use data from SuperMAG, a\nlarge chain with more than 300 geomagnetic stations, to study geoeffectiveness\ntriggered by IP shocks. The SuperMAG SML index, an enhanced version of the\nfamiliar AL index, is used in our statistical analysis. The jumps of the SML\nindex triggered by IP shock impacts on the Earth's magnetosphere is\ninvestigated in terms of IP shock orientation and speed. We find that, in\ngeneral, strong (high speed) and almost frontal (small impact angle) shocks are\nmore geoeffective than inclined shocks with low speed. The strongest\ncorrelation (correlation coefficient R = 0.70) occurs for fixed IP shock speed\nand varying the IP shock impact angle. We attribute this result, predicted\npreviously with simulations, to the fact that frontal shocks compress the\nmagnetosphere symmetrically from all sides, which is a favorable condition for\nthe release of magnetic energy stored in the magnetotail, which in turn can\nproduce moderate to strong auroral substorms, which are then observed by ground\nbased magnetometers.\n",

It is found that above ~50-100 MeV/nuc the spectra of\nall the nuclei, H, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe are well connected between 100\nMeV/nuc and 10 GeV/nuc and above by simple source rigidity spectra proportional\nto P-2.28, with the exponent independent of rigidity and using a rigidity\ndependent diffusion coefficient ~P0.50 above ~1.0 GV. This leads to intensities\nand spectra ~P-2.78 at ~100 GeV/nuc and above, which are consistent with new\nAMS-2 and PAMELA measurements of H, He and C to within + 10%.\n  Below 50-100 MeV the spectra of these primary charges fall into two groups.\nThe spectra of primary nuclei with Z > 6 fall more rapidly at low energies than\nthose of H and He and more rapidly than would be expected from a pure diffusive\nLBM, where energy loss by ionization is important at low energies. Increasing\nthe fraction of ionized hydrogen in the interstellar medium from 15% to 30%\ndoes not satisfactorily explain the systematics of the intensity decreases of\nthe heavier primary nuclei at low energies. Other processes beyond those\nassumed in a simple leaky box model, such as a lack of cosmic ray sources near\nthe Sun are being investigated as the source of this more rapid intensity\ndecrease of these nuclei.\n  The spectra of H and He are very similar to each other but both contain more\nlow energy particles than would be expected from a correspondence with the\nheavier nuclei spectra.

We also determined the escape and\ncollisional basins and computed the corresponding escape/collisional times. We\nhope our contribution to be useful for a further understanding of the escape\nand collisional mechanism of orbits in the restricted three-body problem.\n",

The ICMEs\nwere identified by a relatively smooth rotation of the magnetic field direction\nconsistent with a flux rope structure, coinciding with a relatively enhanced\nmagnetic field strength. A total of 35 ICMEs were found in the surveyed MES\ndata (primarily from March 2007 to April 2012), and 84 ICMEs in the surveyed\nVEX data (from May 2006 to December 2013). The ICME flux rope configurations\nhave been determined. Ropes with northward leading edges were about four times\nmore common than ropes with southward leading edges, in agreement with a\npreviously established solar cycle dependence. Ropes with low inclinations to\nthe solar equatorial plane were about four times more common than ropes with\nhigh inclinations, possibly an observational effect. Left and right-handed\nropes were observed in almost equal numbers. In addition, data from MES, VEX,\nSTEREO-A, STEREO-B and ACE were examined for multipoint signatures of the\ncatalogued ICMEs. For spacecraft separations below 15{\\deg} in heliocentric\nlongitude, the second spacecraft observed the ICME flux rope in 82% of cases;\nthis percentage dropped to 49% for separations between 15 and 30{\\deg}, to 18%\nfor separations between 30 and 45{\\deg}, and to 12% for separations between 45\nand 60{\\deg}. As spacecraft separation increased, it became increasingly likely\nthat only the sheath and not the flux rope of the ICME was observed, in\nagreement with the notion that ICME flux ropes are smaller in longitudinal\nextent than the shocks or discontinuities that they often drive. Furthermore,\nthis study has identified 23 ICMEs observed by pairs of spacecraft close to\nradial alignment. A detailed analysis of these events could lead to a better\nunderstanding of how ICMEs evolve during propagation.\n",

Permanent observations of ULF waves involve\nexistence of the permanent source and, as the previous studies showed, the\ncontributions to Pc4-Pc5 ULF wave power from the external sources are larger\nthan the contribution from internal magnetosphere sources. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI) can generate on the magnetosphere flanks classical ULF\nresonant waves with spatially localized amplitude maximum. As observations show\nthe constraint satisfaction of KHI development is quite rare. SI in solar wind\ndynamic pressure generate ULF waves with different polarization and frequency\nclose to the frequency of the local field line resonance (FLR). Wide range of\ntemporal and amplitude characteristics of solar wind dynamics can generate\nmagnetosphere cavity modes and magnetosonic perturbations which penetrate\nthrough the magnetosphere and can couple with the local FLR modes.

Of\nparticular interest are auroral substorms, characterized by spatial variations\nof order 100 m and temporal variations of order 10 ms. These scales are thought\nto be produced by dispersive Alfv\\'en waves in the near-Earth magnetosphere.\nThe auroral tomography system characterized in this paper reconstructs the\nauroral volume emission rate to estimate the characteristic energy and location\nin the direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of peak electron\nprecipitation flux using a distributed network of precisely synchronized\nground-based cameras. As the observing baseline decreases, the tomographic\ninverse problem becomes highly ill-conditioned; as the sampling rate increases,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio degrades and synchronization requirements become\nincreasingly critical. Our approach to these challenges uses a physics-based\nauroral model to regularize the poorly-observed vertical dimension.\nSpecifically, the vertical dimension is expanded in a low-dimensional basis\nconsisting of eigenprofiles computed over the range of expected energies in the\nprecipitating electron flux, while the horizontal dimension retains a standard\northogonal pixel basis. Simulation results show typical characteristic energy\nestimation error less than 30% for a 3 km baseline achievable within the\nconfines of the Poker Flat Research Range, using GPS-synchronized Electron\nMultiplying CCD cameras with broad-band BG3 optical filters that pass prompt\nauroral emissions.\n",

The present paper reports the\nexistence of frequency-peaks < 20 mHz in the compressional component of the\nmagnetic field in almost all CHAMP passes. The magnetic field variations\nassociated with these frequencies have amplitude of a few tens of nT during\ndaytime. The geomagnetic activity and interplanetary magnetic field parameters\nwere observed to be low during the period of study. The spectral powers of the\nobserved frequencies show no dependence on solar wind velocity and cone angle;\nhence the reported frequencies are not related to the geomagnetic pulsations.\nFor frequency-peaks <15 mHz, strong local-time dependence is observed with\nmaximum power near noon and minimum at night. The longitudinal and seasonal\nvariations of the powers of these frequency-peaks match well with those of the\nequator-to-middle latitude ionospheric currents derived by the earlier studies.\nAs a polar Low-Earth-Orbiting (LEO) satellite spans the entire range of\nlatitudes within few minutes, it monitors the geomagnetic field variations\ncaused by the quiet-time ionospheric currents flowing at different latitudes.\nThis can result in certain frequencies in the magnetic field recorded by LEO\nsatellites. We demonstrate that the frequencies <10mHz are mainly due to the\nlatitudinal structure of the equatorial electrojet. The observed frequencies in\nCHAMP data are therefore attributed to the latitudinal structures of the\nionospheric currents that are monitored only by the polar LEO satellites and\nare found to alter the observations of geomagnetic pulsations (Pc4-5 and Pi2)\nsignificantly.\n",

In our\nattempts to solve this mystery we have first tried to define reasonable limits\nto the positrons produced in our own galaxy by nuclear interactions of cosmic\nrays. This is best done by using the secondary B/C ratio produced by these same\ncosmic rays in order to define the amount of matter traversed by galactic\ncosmic ray nuclei. Using new values of the B/C ratio together with earlier\ncalculations of positron production by Moskalenko and Strong, 1998, we find\nthat at 10 GeV this galactic production is from 70% to almost 100% of the\npositrons observed by the above experiments. At 100 GeV these fractions are\nstill from 20 to 33% of the positrons observed. The resulting excess positron\nspectrum above this normal galactic background is found to have an exponent\n-2.75, possibly flattening at lower energies. If these positrons are coming to\nus from a uniform source distribution in and beyond the disk of the galaxy with\na source spectrum that is E-2.0, a spectral steepening caused by synchrotron\nand inverse Compton losses, which are largest near the galactic plane, will\nproduce a spectrum E-2.75 at the Earth. This is similar to the excess spectrum\nwe find. The excess positron spectrum E-2.75 that we obtain is also very\nsimilar to the positron spectrum produced by galactic protons in the Earths\natmosphere and in the spacecraft itself which also has a spectrum E-2.75. This\nresults in a background for all the above experiments. The assumption is that\nthis type of background is removed by the stringent criteria that are imposed\non each event. This calculation needs to be reconsidered before the\nimplications of these important positron results can be fully evaluated.\n",

While STEREO A\nobserved the expected characteristics of an SEP event at a well-connected\nposition, STEREO B detected a very anisotropic bi-directional distribution of\nnear-relativistic electrons and was situated inside a magnetic-cloud-like\nstructure during the early phase of the event.

On the\nother hand, a mirroring scenario where the incident beam is reflected in the\nopposite loop leg could be the reason. Furthermore, the energetic electron\nobservations are used to probe the magnetic structure inside the magnetic\ncloud. We show that STEREO B was embedded in an MC-like structure ejected three\ndays earlier. We apply a GCS model to the coronagraph observations from three\nviewpoints as well as the Global Magnetic Cloud model to the in situ\nmeasurements at STEREO B to determine the orientation and topology of the MC\nclose to the Sun and at 1 AU. We also estimate the path lengths of the\nelectrons propagating through the MC to estimate the amount of magnetic field\nline winding inside the structure. The relative intensity and timing of the\nenergetic electron increases in the different SEPT telescopes at STEREO B\nstrongly suggest that the bi-directional electron distribution is formed by SEP\ninjections in both loop legs of the MC separately instead of by mirroring\nfarther away beyond the STEREO orbit.

Species distributions in the foreshock\nregion are depicted within the transition of the shock (measured ~2\nc/{\\omega}pi for {\\Theta}Bn =90o and MMS =4.7 ) and in the downstream. The size\nof the foot jump in the magnetic field at the shock is measured to be (1.7\nc/{\\omega}pi ). In the foreshocked region, the thermal velocity is found equal\nto 213 km.sec-1 at 15 RE and is equal to 63 km.sec-1at 12 RE (Magnetosheath\nregion). Despite the large cell size of the current version of the PIC code, it\nis powerful to retain macrostructure of planets magnetospheres in very short\ntime, thus it can be used for a pedagogical test purposes. It is also likely\ncomplementary with MHD to deepen our understanding of the large scale\nmagnetosphere\n",

One full year (155\nCluster orbits) of the Earth's magnetosphere is simulated using Grand Unified\nMagnetosphere Ionosphere Coupling simulation (GUMICS-4) magnetohydrodynamic\ncode. Real solar wind measurements are given to the code as input to create the\nlongest lasting global magnetohydrodynamics simulation to date. The\napplicability of the results of the simulation depends critically on the input\nparameters used in the model. Therefore, the validity and the variance of the\nOMNIWeb data is first investigated thoroughly using Cluster measurement close\nto the bow shock. The OMNIWeb and the Cluster data were found to correlate very\nwell before the bow shock. The solar wind magnetic field and plasma parameters\nare not changed significantly from the $L_1$ Lagrange point to the foreshock,\ntherefore the OMNIWeb data is appropriate input to the GUMICS-4. The Cluster\nSC3 footprints are determined by magnetic field mapping from the simulation\nresults and the Tsyganenko (T96) model in order to compare two methods. The\ndetermined footprints are in rather good agreement with the T96. However, it\nwas found that the footprints agree better in the northern hemisphere than the\nsouthern one during quiet conditions. If the By is not zero, the agreement of\nthe GUMICS-4 and T96 footprint is worse in longitude in the southern\nhemisphere. Overall, the study implies that a 3D MHD model can increase our\ninsight of the response of the magnetosphere to solar wind conditions.\n",

This has heretofore not been\npractical because it is difficult to locate where reconnection occurs for\noblique IMF, but new techniques make this possible. The approach is to identify\nmagnetic separators, the curves separating four regions of differing magnetic\ntopology, which map the reconnection X-line. The electric field parallel to the\nX-line is the local reconnection rate. We compare results to a simple model of\nlocal two-dimensional asymmetric reconnection. To do so, we find the plasma\nparameters that locally drive reconnection in the magnetosheath and\nmagnetosphere in planes perpendicular to the X-line at a large number of points\nalong the X-line. The global magnetohydrodynamic simulations are from the\nthree-dimensional Block-Adaptive, Tree Solarwind Roe-type Upwind Scheme\n(BATS-R-US) code with a uniform resistivity, although the techniques described\nhere are extensible to any global magnetospheric simulation model. We find that\nthe predicted local reconnection rates scale well with the measured values for\nall simulations, being nearly exact for due southward IMF. However, the\nabsolute predictions differ by an undetermined constant of proportionality,\nwhose magnitude increases as the IMF clock angle changes from southward to\nnorthward. We also show similar scaling agreement in a simulation with oblique\nsouthward IMF and a dipole tilt. The present results will be an important\ncomponent of a full understanding of the local and global properties of dayside\nreconnection.\n",

Firstly, separating the influences of these parameters on\nphysical mechanisms such as energy dissipation. Secondly, correlating\nobservations of shock waves over a wide range of each parameter, enough to span\nacross different regimes. Investigating the latter has been restricted since\nthe majority of studies on shocks at exotic regimes (such as supernova\nremnants) have been achieved either remotely or via simulations, but rarely by\nmeans of in-situ observations. Here we present the parameter space of MA bow\nshock crossings from 2004-2014 as observed by the Cassini spacecraft. We find\nthat Saturn's bow shock exhibits characteristics akin to both terrestrial and\nastrophysical regimes (MA of order 100), which is principally controlled by the\nupstream magnetic field strength. Moreover, we determined the {\\theta}Bn of\neach crossing to show that Saturn's (dayside) bow shock is predominantly\nquasi-perpendicular by virtue of the Parker spiral at 10 AU. Our results\nsuggest a strong dependence on MA in controlling the onset of physical\nmechanisms in collisionless shocks, particularly non-time stationarity and\nvariability.

Measuring cold ions is difficult though.\nObservations have to be done at sufficiently high altitudes and typically in\nregions of space where spacecraft attain a positive charge due to solar\nillumination. Cold ions are therefore shielded from the satellite particle\ndetectors. Furthermore, spacecraft can only cover key regions of ion outflow\nduring segments of their orbit, so additional complications arise if continuous\nlongtime observations, such as during a geomagnetic storm, are needed. In this\npaper we suggest a new approach, based on a combination of synoptic\nobservations and a novel technique to estimate the flux and total outflow\nduring the various phases of geomagnetic storms. Our results indicate large\nvariations in both outflow rates and transport throughout the storm. Prior to\nthe storm main phase, outflow rates are moderate, and the cold ions are mainly\nemanating from moderately sized polar cap regions. Throughout the main phase of\nthe storm, outflow rates increase and the polar cap source regions expand.\nFurthermore, faster transport, resulting from enhanced convection, leads to a\nmuch larger supply of cold ions to the near-Earth region during geomagnetic\nstorms.\n",

It was deduced that each surge occurred just after each onset of a\nmultiple-onset substorm, which was small-scale and did not clearly expand\nwestward, because they were observed almost simultaneously with Pi 2 pulsations\nat the magnetic equator and magnetic bay variations at middle-to-high latitudes\nassociated with the DP-1 current system. The EEASs showed similar properties to\nomega bands or torches reported in previous studies, such as recurrence\nintervals of about 15 min, concurrence with magnetic pulsations with amplitudes\nof several tens of nanotesla, horizontal scales of 300-400 km, and occurrence\nof a pulsating aurora in a diffuse aurora after the passage of the EEASs.\nFurthermore, the EEASs showed similar temporal evolution to the omega bands,\nduring which eastward-propagating auroral streamers occurred simultaneously in\nthe poleward region, followed by the formation of north-south-aligned auroras,\nwhich eventually connected with the EEASs. Thus, we speculate that EEASs may be\nrelated to the generation process of omega bands. (Continued)\n",

The angle between the magnetic field vectors at two sides\nof the current sheet was ~ 10{\\deg}. The minimum magnetic field magnitude\nwithin HFA was ~ 1 nT. The shock at two sides of the HFA was\nquasi-perpendicular. Upstream beam was observed on the leading side of the HFA.\nParameters and velocity distributions of solar wind ions and of upstream ions\nobserved on C1 and C3 spacecraft are analyzed separately in order to trace\ntheir changes across the event. The goal of this analysis was to get more\ninformation about the source of upstream beam. The beam evolved from the start\nof its observation till the HFA encounter being initially energetic and nearly\nmono-energetic. Its mean energy continuously decreased and energy spectrum\nwidened as HFA approached spacecraft. First observation of particular energy\nthat diminished with approaching the HFA varied linearly with gyro-radius of\nions. The energy spectra of integrated beam (for all observation) and the\nenergy spectrum of the beam observed just in front of HFA are very similar to\nthe magnetosheath ion energy spectrum observed after bow shock crossing at ~ 1\nhour after observation of the HFA. Lowest energies in the beam were observed\nwithin HFA only. Highest density and pressure of upstream beam are found in the\ncurrent sheet itself. We suggest that the upstream beam is the result of the\nmagnetosheath ions leakage through the region of HFA crossing with the bow\nshock front.\n",

Here, we present flux\nenhancements with 30--100-keV electrons related to NWC transmitter for the\nfirst time, which were observed by the GOES satellite at night. Similar to the\n100--300-keV precipitated-electron havior, the low energy 30--100-keV electron\nprecipitation is primarily located east of the transmitter. However, the latter\ndoes not drift eastward to the same extent as the former, possibly because of\nthe lower electron velocity. The 30--100-keV electrons are distributed in the\nL=1.8--2.1 shell range, in contrast to the 100--300-keV electrons which are at\nL=1.67--1.9. This is consistent with the perspective that the energy of the\nVLF-wave-induced electron flux enhancement decreases with higher L-shell\nvalues. We expand upon the rationality of the simultaneous enhancement of the\n30--100- and 100--300-keV electron fluxes through comparison with the cyclotron\nresonance theory for the quasi-linear wave-particle interaction. In addition,\nwe interpret the asymmetry characteristics of NWC electric power distribution\nin north and south hemisphere by ray tracing model. Finally, we present\nconsiderable discussion and show that good agreement exists between the\nobservation of satellites and theory.\n",

For the perspective of Solar-Terrestrial\nrelationship, it will be of great importance to estimate the properties of\npost-shock solar wind simply and accurately. Motivated by this, we performed a\nstatistical analysis of IP shocks during 1998-2008, focusing on the\nsignificantly different responses of two well-used geomagnetic indices (SYMH\nand AL) to the passive of two types of IP shocks. For the IP shocks with\nnorthward IMF (91 cases), the SYMH index keeps on the high level after the\nsudden impulses (SI) for a long time. Meanwhile, the change of AL index is\nrelative small, with an mean value of only -29 nT. However, for the IP shocks\nwith southward IMF (92 cases), the SYMH index suddenly decreases at a certain\nrate after SI, and the change of AL index is much significant, of -316 nT.\nFurthermore, the change rate of SYMH index after SI is found to be linearly\ncorrelated with the post-shock reconnection E-field (E$_{KL}$). Based on these\nfacts, an inversion model of post-shock IMF orientation and E$_{KL}$ is\ndeveloped. The model validity is also confirmed by studying 68 IP shocks in the\nperiod of 2009-2013.

Generally, at small\ndistances from the Sun, in both the slow and fast solar wind, we observe the\nhigh degree of multifractality (intermittency) that decreases somewhat slowly\nwith distance and slowly with latitude. The obtained results seem to suggest\nthat generally intermittency in the solar wind has a solar origin. However, the\nfast and slow streams, shocks, and other nonlinear interactions can only be\nconsidered as the drivers of the intermittent turbulence. It seems that\nanalysis shows that turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane evolves too slowly to\nmaintain the intermittency with the distance and latitude. Moreover, we confirm\nthat the multifractality and intermittency are at a lower level than in the\necliptic, as well as the existence of symmetry with respect to the ecliptic\nplane, suggesting that there are similar turbulent properties observed in the\ntwo hemispheres.\n",

In this Letter we utilise single spacecraft\nelectric and magnetic field waveform measurements from the ARTEMIS mission to\ncalculate the plasma frame frequency and wavevector of individual wave packets\nover multiple intervals. This allows direct comparison of experimental\nmeasurements with theoretical dispersion relations to identify the observed\nwaves as whistler waves. The whistlers are right-hand circularly polarised,\ntravel anti-sunward and are aligned with the background magnetic field. Their\ndispersion is strongly affected by the local electron parallel beta in\nagreement with linear theory.

        "summary": "  In this study we considered a solar sail coated with materials that undergo\nthermal desorption at a specific temperature, as a result of heating by solar\nradiation at a particular heliocentric distance. Three different scenarios,\nthat only differ in the way the sail approaches the Sun, were analyzed and\ncompared. In every case once the perihelion is reached, the sail coat undergoes\nthermal desorption. When the desorption process ends, the sail then escapes the\nSolar System having the conventional acceleration due to solar radiation\npressure. Thermal desorption here comes as an additional source of solar sail\nacceleration beside traditional propulsion systems for extrasolar space\nexploration. The compared scenarios are the following: i. Hohmann transfer plus\nthermal desorption. In this scenario the sail would be carried as a payload to\nthe perihelion with a conventional propulsion system by an Hohmann transfer\nfrom Earth's orbit to an orbit very close to the Sun (almost at 0.1 AU) and\nthen be deployed there. ii. Elliptical transfer plus Slingshot plus thermal\ndesorption. In this scenario the transfer occurs from Earth's orbit to\nJupiter's orbit. A Jupiter's fly-by leads to the orbit close to the Sun, where\nthe sail is deployed. iii. Two stage acceleration of the solar sail through\nthermal desorption. The proposed sail has two coats of the materials that\nundergo thermal desorption at different temperatures depending on the\nheliocentric distance. The first desorption occurs at the Earth orbit and\nprovides the thrust needed to propel the solar sail toward the Sun. The second\ndesorption is equivalent to that of the other scenarios.\n",

It is commonly accepted that the turbulence is driven by\n(counter-)collisions between these counter-propagating wave fractions. Contrary\nto this, we found a new ion-scale dynamical range of the turbulence established\nby (co-)collisions among waves co-propagating in the same direction along\n$B_0$. Co-collisions become stronger than counter-collisions and produce steep\nnon-universal spectra above certain wavenumbers dependent on the imbalance.\nSpectral indexes of the strong turbulence vary around -3, such that steeper\nspectra follow larger imbalances. Intermittency steepens the -3 spectra\nfurther, up to -3.7. Our theoretical predictions are compatible with steep\nvariable spectra observed in the solar wind at ion kinetic scales, but further\nverifications are needed by correlating observed spectra with measured\nimbalances.\n",

One common method to\ncalculate the space plasma parameters is by fitting the observed distributions\nusing known analytical forms. More often, the distribution function is included\nin a forward model of the instrument's response, which is used to reproduce the\nobserved energy spectrograms for a given set of plasma parameters. In both\ncases, the modeled plasma distribution fits the measurements to estimate the\nplasma parameters. The distribution function is often considered to be\nMaxwellian even though in many cases the plasma is better described by a kappa\ndistribution. In this work we show that if the plasma is described by a kappa\ndistribution, the derived temperature assuming Maxwell distribution can be\nsignificantly off. More specifically, we derive the plasma temperature by\nfitting a Maxwell distribution to pseudo-data produced by a kappa distribution,\nand then examine the difference of the derived temperature as a function of the\nkappa index. We further consider the concept of using a forward model of a\ntypical plasma instrument to fit its observations. We find that the relative\nerror of the derived temperature is highly depended on the kappa index and\noccasionally on the instrument's field of view and response.\n",

Beside the\nhomogeneous turbulence, generation of small scale fluctuations can take place\nalso in other realistic configurations, namely, when perturbations superpose to\nan inhomogeneous background magnetic field. When an Alfv\\'en wave propagates in\na medium where the Alfv\\'en speed varies in a direction transverse to the mean\nfield, it undergoes phase-mixing, which progressively bends wavefronts,\ngenerating small scales in the transverse direction. As soon as transverse\nscales get of the order of the proton inertial length $d_p$, kinetic Alfv\\'en\nwaves (KAWs) are naturally generated. KAWs belong to the branch of Alfv\\'en\nwaves and propagate nearly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, at\nscales close to $d_p$. Many numerical, observational and theoretical works have\nsuggested that these fluctuations may play a determinant role in the\ndevelopment of the solar-wind turbulent cascade. In the present paper, the\ngeneration of large amplitude KAW fluctuations in inhomogeneous background and\ntheir effect on the protons have been investigated by means of hybrid\nVlasov-Maxwell direct numerical simulations. Imposing a pressure balanced\nmagnetic shear, the kinetic dynamics of protons has been investigated by\nvarying both the magnetic configuration and the amplitude of the initial\nperturbations. Of interest here is the transition from quasi-linear to\nturbulent regimes, focusing, in particular, on the development of important\nnon-Maxwellian features in the proton distribution function driven by KAW\nfluctuations.\n",

To investigate the solar origin\nand formation of these transients we studied kinematic and thermodynamic\nproperties of the expanding coronal structures using the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) EUV images and the\ndifferential emission measure (DEM) diagnostics. The Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager (HMI) magnetic field maps were used as the input data for the 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to describe the flux rope ejection. We\ncharacterize the early phase of the flux rope ejection in the corona, where the\nusual three-component CME structure formed. The flux rope ejected with a speed\nof about 200~km~s$^{-1}$ to the height of 0.25~R$_{\\odot}$. The kinematics of\nthe modeled CME front agrees well with the Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory (STEREO) EUV measurements.

The interactions were observed by several\nspacecraft, including Mars Express (MEX), Mars Atmosphere and Volatile\nEvolution Mission (MAVEN), and Mars Odyssey (MO). The ICME disturbances were\ncharacterized by an increase in ion speed, plasma temperature, magnetic field\nmagnitude, and energetic electron flux. Furthermore, increased solar wind\ndensity and speeds, unusually high local electron densities and high flow\nvelocities were detected on the nightside at high altitudes during the March\n8th event. These effects are thought to be due to the transport of ionospheric\nplasma away from Mars. The peak electron density at periapsis shows a\nsubstantial increase, reaching number densities about 2.7 x 104 cm-3 during the\nsecond ICME in the deep nightside, which corresponds to an increase in the\nMOHigh-Energy Neutron Detector flux, suggesting an increase in the ionization\nof the neutral atmosphere due to the high intensity of charged particles. SEPs\nshow a substantial enhancement before the shock of fourth ICME causing impact\nionization and absorption of the surface echo intensity which drops to the\nnoise levels. Moreover, the peak ionospheric density exhibits a discrete\nenhancement over a period of about 30 hrs around the same location, which maybe\ndue to impact ionization. Ion escape rates at this time are calculated to be in\nthe order of 1025 - 1026 s-1, consistent with MAVEN results, but somewhat\nhigher.\n",

Since particle collisions are practically\nnegligible, the solar wind is typically not in a state of thermodynamic\nequilibrium. Such a complex system must be described through self-consistent\nand fully nonlinear models, taking into account its multi-species composition\nand turbulence. We use a kinetic hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell numerical code to\nreproduce the turbulent energy cascade down to ion kinetic scales, in typical\nconditions of the uncontaminated solar wind plasma, with the aim of exploring\nthe differential kinetic dynamics of the dominant ion species, namely protons\nand alpha particles. We show that the response of different species to the\nfluctuating electromagnetic fields is different. In particular, a significant\ndifferential heating of alphas with respect to protons is observed.\nInterestingly, the preferential heating process occurs in spatial regions\nnearby the peaks of ion vorticity and where strong deviations from\nthermodynamic equilibrium are recovered. Moreover, by feeding a simulator of a\ntop-hat ion spectrometer with the output of the kinetic simulations, we show\nthat measurements by such spectrometer planned on board the Turbulence Heating\nObserveR (THOR mission), a candidate for the next M4 space mission of the\nEuropean Space Agency, can provide detailed three-dimensional ion velocity\ndistributions, highlighting important non-Maxwellian features.

        "summary": "  Interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere is\nassociated with large-scale currents in the ionosphere at polar latitudes that\nflow along magnetic field lines (Birkeland currents) and horizontally. These\ncurrent systems are tightly linked, but their global behaviors are rarely\nanalyzed together. In this paper, we present estimates of the average global\nBirkeland currents and horizontal ionospheric currents from the same set of\nmagnetic field measurements. The magnetic field measurements, from the low\nEarth orbiting $\\textit{Swarm}$ and CHAMP satellites, are used to co-estimate\npoloidal and toroidal parts of the magnetic disturbance field, represented in\nmagnetic apex coordinates. The use of apex coordinates reduces effects of\nlongitudinal and hemispheric variations in the Earth's main field. We present\nglobal currents from both hemispheres during different sunlight conditions. The\nresults show that the Birkeland currents vary with the conductivity, which\ndepends most strongly on solar EUV emissions on the dayside and on particle\nprecipitation at pre-midnight magnetic local times. In sunlight, the horizontal\nequivalent current flows in two cells, resembling an opposite ionospheric\nconvection pattern, which implies that it is dominated by Hall currents. By\ncombining the Birkeland current maps and the equivalent current, we are able to\ncalculate the total horizontal current, without any assumptions about the\nconductivity. We show that the total horizontal current is close to zero in the\npolar cap when it is dark. That implies that the equivalent current, which is\nsensed by ground magnetometers, is largely canceled by the horizontal closure\nof the Birkeland currents.\n",

The disturbances\nthat are created in this interaction propagate along magnetic field lines and\ninteract with the ionosphere-thermosphere system. At ionospheric altitudes, the\nEarth's field deviates significantly from a dipole. North-South asymmetries in\nthe magnetic field imply that the magnetosphere ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T)\ncoupling is different in the two hemispheres. In this paper we review the\nprimary differences in the magnetic field at polar latitudes, and the\nconsequences that these have for the M-I-T coupling. We focus on two\ninterhemispheric differences which are thought to have the strongest effects:\n1) A difference in the offset between magnetic and geographic poles in the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres, and 2) differences in the magnetic field\nstrength at magnetically conjugate regions. These asymmetries lead to\ndifferences in plasma convection, neutral winds, total electron content, ion\noutflow, ionospheric currents and auroral precipitation.\n",

Our study targets six SPEs\nfrom 2003 to 2012. By using measurements from the Medium Energy Proton and\nElectron Detector on all available Polar Orbit Environment Satellites (POES),\nwe show that in the main phase of geomagnetic storms the dayside cutoff\nlatitudes are pushed poleward, while the nightside cutoff latitudes have the\nopposite response, resulting in strong day-night asymmetries in the energy\ndeposition. These features cannot bemeasured by the frequently used\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Assuming that the\nprotons impact the polar atmosphere homogeneously above a fixed nominal\nlatitude boundary will therefore give a significant overestimate of the energy\ndeposited in the middle atmosphere during SPEs. We discuss the magnetospheric\nmechanisms responsible for the local time response in the cutoff latitudes and\nprovide a simple applicable parameterization which includes both dayside and\nnightside cutoff latitude variability using only the Dst, the northward\ncomponent of the interplanetary magnetic field, and solar wind pressure. The\nparameterization is utilized on the GOES particle fluxes, and the resulting\nenergy deposition successfully captures the day-night asymmetry in good\nagreement with the energy deposition predicted from the POES measurement.\n",

The observed wintertime PW activity shows common\nfeatures associated with the stratospheric wind reversals and the accompanying\nstratospheric warming events. Onset dates for seven SSW events accompanied by\nan elevated stratopause (ES) were identified during this time period using the\nSpecified Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). For the\nseven events, a significant enhancement in wave number 1 and 2 PW amplitudes\nnear 95 km was found to occur after the wind reversed at 50 km, with amplitudes\nmaximizing approximately 5 days after the onset of the wind reversal. This PW\nenhancement in the MLT after the event was confirmed using SD-WACCM. When all\ncases of polar cap wind reversals at 50 km were considered, a significant,\nalbeit moderate, correlation of 0.4 was found between PW amplitudes near 95 km\nand westward polar-cap stratospheric winds at 50 km, with the maximum\ncorrelation occurring $\\sim$ 3 days after the maximum westward wind. These\nresults indicate that the enhancement of PW amplitudes near 95 km is a common\nfeature of SSWs irrespective of the strength of the wind reversal.\n",

This is due to the fact that the charged particles that\ncomprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but\nnot across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena\nrelative to Earth's magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate\nsystems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the\nmagnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common\nmagnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are\nused, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on\nthe spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic\nReference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of\nthe Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most\ndetailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic\nlatitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These\ncoordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are\nnon-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such\ncoordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done\ncorrectly.\n",

Quantitative parameters such as the patch duration (on-time and\noff-time), peak intensity, and integrated intensity are determined for each\npatch and each pulsation. The resulting characteristics serve as strict\nobservational constraints that any of the many competing theories attempting to\nexplain PA must predict. The purpose of this paper is to determine the\ncharacteristics of PA patches in order to provide better observational\nconstraints on the suggested mechanisms. All aspects of the temporal behavior\nof the individual patches appear to be erratic. Historically, PA has been\ndefined very loosely and we argue that the use of the term \"pulsating\" is\ninappropriate since our findings and other published results are not regularly\nperiodic and thus a more appropriate term may be fluctuating aurora. Further,\nwe find that the observational constraints do not fit well with the flow\ncyclotron maser theory, which in particular is suggested to create PA patches.\nThere is no clear candidate of the suggested mechanisms and drivers to explain\nthe observational constraints set by the PA patches in a satisfactory manner.\n",

The two main mechanisms resulting in\nthe eruption of series of CMEs are sympathetic eruptions and homologous\neruptions. The interaction of successive CMEs has been observed remotely in\ncoronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, and inferred from in situ measurements.\nIt is associated with magnetic reconnection, momentum exchange, the propagation\nof a fast magnetosonic shock through a magnetic ejecta and changes in CME\nexpansion. The presence of a CME a few hours before a fast eruption is\nconnected with higher fluxes of SEPs, while CME-CME interaction occurring in\nthe corona is often associated with unusual radio bursts. Higher suprathermal\npopulation, enhanced turbulence and wave activity, stronger shocks, and\nshock-shock or shock-CME interaction have been proposed as physical mechanisms\nto explain these SEP events. When measured in situ, CME-CME interaction may be\nassociated with relatively well organized multiple-magnetic cloud events,\ninstances of shocks propagating through a previous magnetic ejecta or more\ncomplex ejecta. The compression of a CME by another and the propagation of a\nshock inside a magnetic ejecta can lead to extreme values of the southward\nmagnetic field, sometimes associated with large values of the dynamic pressure.\nThis can result in intense geomagnetic storms, but also trigger substorms and\nlarge earthward motions of the magnetopause, potentially associated with\nchanges in the outer radiation belts.

These substructures, shock-sheath and\nmagnetic cloud (MC) manifest as classical two-step Forbush decrease. The recent\nwork by Raghav et. al.

Therefore, present study attempts to investigate\nthe cause of multi-step cosmic ray flux decrease and their respective recovery\nwithin shock-sheath in detail. 3D-hodogram method has been utilized to get more\ndetails of the local structures within the shock-sheath.

During\nthe one-hour long simulation, the FTEs are generated quasi-periodically near\nthe subsolar point and move toward the poles. We find the magnetic field\nsignature of FTEs at their early formation stage is similar to a `crater FTE',\nwhich is characterized by a magnetic field strength dip at the FTE center.\nAfter the FTE core field grows to a significant value, it becomes an FTE with\ntypical flux rope structure. When an FTE moves across the cusp, reconnection\nbetween the FTE field lines and the cusp field lines can dissipate the FTE. The\nkinetic features are also captured by our model. A crescent electron phase\nspace distribution is found near the reconnection site. A similar distribution\nis found for ions at the location where the Larmor electric field appears. The\nlower hybrid drift instability (LHDI) along the current sheet direction also\narises at the interface of magnetosheath and magnetosphere plasma. The LHDI\nelectric field is about 8 mV/m and its dominant wavelength relative to the\nelectron gyroradius agrees reasonably with MMS observations.\n",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive parametric\ninvestigation on the electron-cyclotron-maser instability driven by non-thermal\nring-beam electrons with intrinsic Alfv\\'en waves which pervade the solar\natmosphere and interplanetary space. It is found that both forward propagating\nand backward propagating waves can be excited in the fast ordinary (O) and\nextraordinary (X) electromagnetic modes. The growth rates of X1 mode are almost\nalways weakened by Alfv\\'en waves. The average pitch-angle $\\phi_0$ of\nelectrons is a key parameter for the effect of Alfv\\'en waves on the growth\nrate of modes O1, O2 and X2. For a beam-dominated electron distribution\n($\\phi_0 \\lesssim 30^\\circ$ ), the growth rates of the maser instability for\nO1, O2 and X2 modes are enhanced with the increase of Alfv\\'en wave energy\ndensity. In other conditions, the growth rates of O1, O2 and X2 modes weakened\nwith increasing Alfv\\'en wave intensity, except that the growth of O1 mode may\nalso be enhanced by Alfv\\'en waves for a ring distribution.

We address the response of the\nionospheric convection to changes in the dayside reconnection rate by examining\nmagnetic field perturbations at 780 km altitude. The Active Magnetosphere and\nPlanetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment data products derived from the\nIridium constellation provide global maps of the magnetic field perturbations.\nCluster data just upstream of the Earth's bow shock have been used to estimate\nthe dayside reconnection rate. By using a statistical model where the magnetic\nfield can respond on several time scales, we confirm previous reports of an\nalmost immediate response both near noon and near midnight combined with a\n10-20 min reconfiguration time of the two-cell convection pattern. The response\nof the ionospheric convection has been associated with the expansion of the\npolar cap boundary in the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm. In the original formulation\nof this paradigm the expansion spreads from noon to midnight in 15-20 min.\nHowever, also an immediate global response has been shown to be consistent with\nthe paradigm when the previous dayside reconnection history is considered. In\nthis paper we present a new explanation for how the immediate response can be\naccommodated in the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm. The new explanation is based on\nhow MHD waves propagate in the magnetospheric lobes when newly reconnected open\nflux tubes are added to the lobes, and the magnetopause flaring angle\nincreases.\n",

The proximity of\nthis resonance to the family left side in semi-major axis caused many former\nfamily members to be lost. As a consequence, the family shape in the $(a,1/D)$\ndomain is quite asymmetrical, with a preponderance of objects on the right side\nof the distribution. The Rafita family is also characterized by a leptokurtic\ndistribution in inclination, which allows the use of methods of family age\nestimation recently introduced for other leptokurtic families such as Astrid,\nHansa, Gallia, and Barcelona. In this work we propose a new method based on the\nbehavior of an asymmetry coefficient function of the distribution in the\n$(a,1/D)$ plane to date incomplete asteroid families such as Rafita. By\nmonitoring the time behavior of this coefficient for asteroids simulating the\ninitial conditions at the time of the family formation, we were able to\nestimate that the Rafita family should have an age of $490\\pm200$ Myr, in good\nagreement with results from independent methods such as Monte Carlo simulations\nof Yarkovsky and Yorp dynamical induced evolution and the time behaviour of the\nkurtosis of the $\\sin{(i)}$ distribution.

The goals of this work are to analyse the stability for\nboth homogeneous and inhomogeneous mass distribution and study the effects of\nthe solar radiation pressure in equatorial orbits close to the asteroid\n(101955) Bennu. As results, we find that the mascon model divided into ten\nequal layers seems to be the most suitable for this problem.

For a Sun initial longitude $\\psi_0 = -180^o$, starting\nwith the spacecraft longitude $\\lambda = 0$, the orbits suffer fewer impacts\nand some (between 0.4 and 0.5 km), remaining unwavering even if the maximum\nsolar radiation is considered.

On\n22 January 2012 and 14 January 2013, the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific\nAssociation (EISCAT) radar on Svalbard measured electron temperature\nenhancements exceeding 3000 K near magnetic noon in the cusp ionosphere over\nSvalbard.

This offered an excellent opportunity to\ninvestigate the role of thermally excited O$(^{1}$D) 630.0 nm emissions in the\ncusp ionosphere. The thermal component was derived from the EISCAT Radar\nmeasurements and compared with optical data. For both events the calculated\nthermal component had a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 to the total\nobserved 630.0 nm intensity which contains both thermal and particle impact\ncomponents.

Improved estimates of precipitating\nfluxes of energetic electrons are derived from measurements on board the\nNOAA/POES 18 satellite using a new analysis technique. These fluxes are used to\nquantify the direct impact of energetic electron precipitation (EEP) during\nsolar minimum on middle atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) measured from the Aura\nsatellite. During winter, localized longitudinal density enhancements in the OH\nare observed over northern Russia and North America at corrected geomagnetic\nlatitudes poleward of 55$^{\\circ}$. Although the northern Russia OH enhancement\nis closely associated with increased EEP at these longitudes, the strength and\nlocation of the North America enhancement appear to be unrelated to EEP. This\nOH density enhancement is likely due to vertical motion induced by atmospheric\nwave dynamics that transports air rich in atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen\ndownward into the middle atmosphere, where it plays a role in the formation of\nOH. In the Southern Hemisphere, localized enhancements of the OH density over\nWest Antarctica can be explained by a combination of enhanced EEP due to the\nlocal minimum in Earth's magnetic field strength and atmospheric dynamics. Our\nfindings suggest that even during solar minimum, there is substantial\nEEP-driven OH production.

The\ncharacteristics averaged over the event are in remarkable agreement with the\nspatiotemporal characteristics of the nightside field-aligned currents during\nmoderately disturbed times. Thus, two different electrodynamical parameters of\nthe M-I coupling show similar behavior. This gives independent support to the\nclaim of a system behavior that uses repeatable solutions to transfer energy\nand momentum from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.\n",

The H nuclei have a rigidity 0.7\nGV, the He nuclei 1.4 GV. These measurements cover a 40 year time period, which\nincludes almost 4 cycles of solar 11 year sunspot variations, throughout the\ninner heliosphere out to the HTS at distances of 95 AU and 85 AU, respectively\nat V1 and V2, and then beyond in the heliosheath. Inside the HTS the modulation\npotential vs. time curves at V1 and V2 show a very similar temporal structure\nto those observed at the Earth. During a later period of maximum solar\nmodulation from 2000.0 to 2005.0 when V1 and V2 are in the outer heliosphere\nbetween 60-94 AU, the main temporal features of the modulation potential curves\nat all 3 locations match up with appropriate time delays at V1 and V2 if it is\nassumed that spatially coherent structures are moving outward past V1 and V2,\nwith outward speeds of up to 700 Kms negative 1. After 2004.0 V1 and V2 are at\nlatitudes of positive 35 and negative 30 respectively, placing lower limits on\nthe latitude extent of these structures. Beyond the HTS in the heliosheath the\nmodulation potential slowly decreases at both spacecraft with only a weak\nevidence of the unusual modulation minimum observed at the Earth in 2009, for\nexample. A sudden decrease of the modulation potential 50 MV for both H and He\nnuclei occurs at V1 just before the heliopause crossing at about 122 AU. This\ndecrease has not yet been observed at V2, which is now at 113 AU and still\nobserving a modulation potential 60 MV.\n",

Our model is based on the solution of the electron drift-kinetic\nequation at heliospheric distances where the plasma density, temperature, and\nthe magnetic field strength decline as power-laws of the distance along a\nmagnetic flux tube. Our solution for the strahl depends on a number of\nparameters that, in the absence of the analytic solution for the full electron\nvelocity distribution function (eVDF), cannot be derived from the theory. We\nhowever demonstrate that these parameters can be efficiently found from\nmatching our solution with observations of the eVDF made by the Wind\nsatellite's SWE strahl detector. The model is successful at predicting the\nangular width (FWHM) of the strahl for the Wind data at 1 AU, in particular by\npredicting how this width scales with particle energy and background density.\nWe find the strahl distribution is largely determined by the local temperature\nKnudsen number $\\gamma \\sim |T dT/dx|/n$, which parametrizes solar wind\ncollisionality. We compute averaged strahl distributions for typical Knudsen\nnumbers observed in the solar wind, and fit our model to these data. The model\ncan be matched quite closely to the eVDFs at 1 AU, however, it then\noverestimates the strahl amplitude at larger heliocentric distances. This\nindicates that our model may be improved through the inclusion of additional\nphysics, possibly through the introduction of \"anomalous diffusion\" of the\nstrahl electrons.\n",

Because of the\nlow dynamic pressure in their cores, these phenomena can significantly disturb\nthe bow shock and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Recent observations have\nalso demonstrated that foreshock transients can accelerate particles which,\nwhen transported earthward, can affect space weather. Understanding the\npotential of foreshock transients to accelerate particles can help us\nunderstand shock acceleration at Earth and at other planetary and astrophysical\nsystems. To further investigate foreshock transients' potential for\nacceleration we conduct a statistical study of ion and electron energization in\nthe core of foreshock transients. We find that electron energies typically\nincrease there, evidently due to an internal acceleration process, whereas, as\nexpected, ion energies most often decrease to support transient formation and\nexpansion. Nevertheless, ion energy enhancements can be seen in some events\nsuggesting an internal ion acceleration process as well. Formation conditions\nof foreshock transients are related to weak solar wind magnetic field strength\nand fast solar wind speed. Ion and electron energization are also positively\ncorrelated with solar wind speed.\n",

CMEs whose front moves faster in the\nsolar wind frame than the fast magnetosonic speed, drive shocks. Such shocks\nare important contributors to space weather, by triggering substorms,\ncompressing the magnetosphere and accelerating particles. In general, near 1\nAU, CMEs with speed greater than about 500 km s$^{-1}$ drive shocks, whereas\nslower CMEs do not. However, CMEs as slow as 350 km s$^{-1}$ may sometimes,\nalthough rarely, drive shocks. Here, we study these slow CMEs with shocks and\ninvestigate the importance of CME expansion in contributing to their ability to\ndrive shocks and in enhancing shock strength. Our focus is on CMEs with average\nspeeds under 375 km s$^{-1}$. From Wind measurements from 1996 to 2016, we find\n22 cases of such shock-driving slow CMEs, and, for about half of them (11 out\nof the 22), the existence of the shock appears to be strongly related to CME\nexpansion. We also investigate the proportion of all CMEs with speeds under 500\nkm s$^{-1}$ with and without shocks in solar cycles 23 and 24, depending on\ntheir speed. We find no systematic difference, as might have been expected on\nthe basis of the lower solar wind and Alfv\\'en speeds reported for solar cycle\n24 vs. 23.

The simulation predicts a complex time-dependent magnetic topology\nconsisting of multiple separators and flux ropes. Despite the topological\ncomplexity, the predicted distance between MMS and the primary separator is\nless than 0.5 Earth radii.

The main part of the work has been directed\ntoward the study of plasma instabilities and scintillations in association with\ncusp flow channels and polar cap electron density structures/patches,which is\nconsidered as critical knowledge in order to develop forecast models for\nscintillations in the polar cap. We have approached this problem by\nmulti-instrument techniques that comprise the EISCAT Svalbard Radar, SuperDARN\nradars, in-situ rocket, and GPS scintillation measurements. The Discussion\nsection aims to unify the bits and pieces of highly specialized information\nfrom several papers into a generalized picture. The cusp ionosphere appears as\na hot region in GPS scintillation climatology maps. Our results are consistent\nwith the existing view that scintillations in the cusp and the polar cap\nionosphere are mainly due to multi-scale structures generated by instability\nprocesses associated with the cross-polar transport of polar cap patches. We\nhave demonstrated that the SuperDARN convection model can be used to track\nthese patches backward and forward in time. Hence, once a patch has been\ndetected in the cusp inflow region, SuperDARN can be used to forecast its\ndestination in the future. However, the high-density gradient of polar cap\npatches is not the only prerequisite for high-latitude scintillations.\nUnprecedented high resolution rocket measurements reveal that the cusp\nionosphere is associated with filamentary precipitation giving rise to\nkilometer scale gradients onto which the gradient drift instability can operate\nvery efficiently...

However, such an event could\nprovide us a good opportunity to study the evolution of embedded Alfv\\'enic\nfluctuations (AFs) inside ICME and their contributions to local plasma heating\ndirectly. In this study, an ICME observed by Wind at 1.0 au on March 4-6 1998\nis tracked to the location of Ulysess at 5.4 au. AFs are commonly found inside\nthe ICME at 1.0 au, with an occurrence rate of 21.7% and at broadband\nfrequencies from 4$\\times 10^{-4}$ to 5$\\times 10^{-2}$ Hz. When the ICME\npropagates to 5.4 au, the Aflv\\'enicity decreases significantly, and AFs are\nrare and only found at few localized frequencies with the occurrence rate\ndecreasing to 3.0%. At the same time, the magnetic field intensity at the\nAF-rich region has an extra magnetic dissipation except ICME expansion effect.\nThe energetics of the ICME at different radial distance is also investigated\nhere. Under similar magnetic field intensity situations at 1.0 au, the\nturbulence cascade rate at the AF-rich region is much larger than the value at\nthe AF-lack region. Moreover, it can maintain as the decrease of magnetic field\nintensity if there is lack of AFs. However, when there exists many AFs, it\nreduces significantly as the AFs disappear. The turbulence cascade dissipation\nrate within the ICME is inferred to be 1622.3 $J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$,\nwhich satisfies the requirement of local ICME plasma heating rate, 1653.2\n$J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$.

Can such objects be intercepted? The\nchallenge of reaching the object within a reasonable timeframe is formidable\ndue to its high heliocentric hyperbolic excess velocity of about 26 km/s; much\nfaster than any vehicle yet launched. This paper presents a high-level analysis\nof potential near-term options for a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua and potential\nsimilar objects. Launching a spacecraft to 1I/'Oumuamua in a reasonable\ntimeframe of 5-10 years requires a hyperbolic solar system excess velocity\nbetween 33 to 76 km/s for mission durations between 30 to 5 years. Different\nmission durations and their velocity requirements are explored with respect to\nthe launch date, assuming direct impulsive transfer to the intercept\ntrajectory. For missions using a powered Jupiter flyby combined with a solar\nOberth maneuver using solid rocket boosters and Parker Solar Probe heat shield\ntechnology, a Falcon Heavy-class launcher would be able to launch a spacecraft\nof dozens of kilograms towards 1I/'Oumuamua, if launched in 2021. An additional\nSaturn flyby would allow for the launch of a New Horizons-class spacecraft.\nFurther technology options are outlined, ranging from electric propulsion, and\nmore advanced options such as laser electric propulsion, and solar and laser\nsails. To maximize science return decelerating the spacecraft at 'Oumuamua is\nhighly desirable, due to the minimal science return from a hyper-velocity\nencounter.

A better understanding of\nthe intermediate phase of the exponential deceleration is achieved owing to a\nmore accurate model of the eddy currents torque than in most prior research.

During this period, the PAMELA space\nexperiment observed spectra for galactic cosmic rays, specifically for protons,\nelectrons and positrons over a wide energy range, during what is called an A <\n0 solar magnetic polarity cycle. Drift theory predicts a difference in the\nbehaviour for these oppositely charge particles during A < 0 cycles. An\nopportunity was thus created to study the predicted charge-sign-dependent\nmodulation, also now for very quiet heliospheric conditions. A comprehensive\nthree-dimensional, drift modulation model has been used to study the solar\nmodulation for cosmic rays in detail with extensive comparison to the observed\nPAMELA spectra for the mentioned period. First, this was done for protons and\nsecondly for electrons, as already published, to test and to authenticate the\nmodelling approach and then to come to a better understanding and appreciation\nof the underlying physics, such as diffusion and drift theory. The results were\nalso used to make predictions of how cosmic rays are differently modulated down\nto low energies (1 MeV) for the two magnetic polarity cycles of the Sun, and\nwhat role drifts play in this process. All computed solutions are based on new\nvery local interstellar spectra, now also done for positrons. This report is\nfocussed on detailed aspects of the solar modulation of positrons during the\nextraordinary quiet solar modulation period from 2006 to 2009.

It is known\nfrom our previous work that the efficiency of DSA depends on the shape of\nelectron spectra incident on the TS, which in turn depends on the spectral\nshape of the very local interstellar spectrum. Modulation processes also\ninfluence the efficiency of DSA. We find that TS accelerated electrons can make\ncontributions throughout the heliosphere to intensity levels, especially at\nlower energies. An interesting result is that increases caused by DSA at the TS\nare comparable in magnitude to electron intensity enhancements observed by\nVoyager 1 ahead of the TS crossing. These intensity increases are large enough\nto account for observed intensity peaks, and thus supports the view that DSA is\ninvolved in their production. Additionally, the energy spectra observed by\nVoyager 1 throughout the heliosheath are reproduced satisfactorily, as well as\nthe PAMELA spectrum at Earth at higher energies. We also find that an increase\nin the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficients for these low-energy\nelectrons seems required to reproduce the spectral shape of observed modulated\nspectra in the heliosheath at kinetic energy E < ~ 4 MeV. This is different\nfrom intermediate energies where rigidity independent diffusion explains\nobservations satisfactory.\n",

Using a simple Leaky Box Model\n(LBM) for galactic propagation we have not been able to simultaneously\nreproduce the individual He and C nuclei spectra and the large increase in He/C\nratio that is observed at low energies. However, using a truncated LBM with\ndifferent truncation parameters for each nucleus that are related to their rate\nof energy loss by ionization which is ~Z2/A, these different features can be\nmatched. This suggests that we are observing the effects of the source\ndistribution of cosmic rays in the galaxy on the low energy spectra of cosmic\nray nuclei and that there may be a paucity of nearby sources. In this\npropagation model we start very specific source spectra for He and C which are\n~dj/dP = P-2.24, the same for each nucleus and also for all rigidities. These\nsource spectra become spectra with spectral indices ~-2.69 at high rigidities\nfor both charges as a result of a rigidity dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient governing the propagation which is taken to be ~P-0.45. This\nexponent is determined directly from the B/C ratio measured by AMS-2. These\npropagated P-2.69 spectra, when extended to high energies, predict He and C\nintensities and a He/C ratio that are within +3-5% of the intensities and ratio\nrecently measured by AMS-2 in the energy range from 10 to 1000 GeV/nuc.\n",

Figures\nthat result from this mapping allow for easy qualitative assessment of\nsimilarity in the profiles. Macroscale features in the profiles that varied on\ntimescales of 1 hour, and which corresponded to the underlying flux rope\nstructure of the ICMEs, were well correlated in the solar east-west and\nnorth-south directions, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of around 0.85\nand 0.95, respectively; microscale features with timescales of 1 minute were\nuncorrelated. Overall correlation values in the profiles of one ICME were\nincreased when an apparent change in the flux rope axis direction between the\nobserving spacecraft was taken into account. The high degree of similarity seen\nin the B-field profiles may be interpreted in in two ways. If the spacecraft\nsampled the same region of each ICME (i.e. if the spacecraft angular\nseparations can be neglected), the similarity indicates that there was little\nevolution in the underlying structure of the sampled region during propagation.\nAlternatively, if the spacecraft observed different, nearby regions within the\nICMEs, it indicates that there was spatial homogeneity across those different\nregions.

While it is generally\naccepted that energetic protons can be accelerated by shocks, whether or not\nthese shocks can also efficiently accelerate solar energetic electrons is still\ndebated. In this study we present observations of the extremely widespread SEP\nevent of 26 Dec 2013. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the widest\nlongitudinal SEP distribution ever observed together with unusually\nlong-lasting energetic electron anisotropies at all observer positions. Further\nstriking features of the event are long-lasting SEP intensity increases, two\ndistinct SEP components with the second component mainly consisting of\nhigh-energy particles, a complex associated coronal activity including a\npronounced signature of a shock in radio type-II observations, and the\ninteraction of two CMEs early in the event. The observations require a\nprolonged injection scenario not only for protons but also for electrons. We\ntherefore analyze the data comprehensively to characterize the possible role of\nthe shock for the electron event. Remote-sensing observations of the complex\nsolar activity are combined with in-situ measurements of the particle event. We\nalso apply a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the coronagraph\nobservations of the two associated CMEs to analyze their interaction. We find\nthat the shock alone is likely not responsible for this extremely wide SEP\nevent. Therefore we propose a scenario of trapped energetic particles inside\nthe CME-CME interaction region which undergo further acceleration due to the\nshock propagating through this region, stochastic acceleration, or ongoing\nreconnection processes inside the interaction region. The origin of the second\ncomponent of the SEP event is likely caused by a sudden opening of the particle\ntrap.\n",

A detailed analysis of the ICME solar sources in\nthe period under study showed that in 11 cases out of 23 the observed ICME\nmight be associated with two or more sources. In cases of multiple-source\nevents, the resulting solar wind disturbances may be described as complex\n(merged) structures occurred due to the stream interactions with properties\ndepending on the type of participating streams. As a reliable marker for\nidentification of interacting streams and their sources, we used the plasma ion\ncomposition, as it becomes frozen in the low corona and remains unchanged in\nthe heliosphere. According to the ion composition signatures, we classified\nthese cases into three types: complex ejecta originating from weak and strong\nCME-CME interactions, as well as merged interaction regions originating from\nthe CME-high-speed stream interactions. We described temporal profiles of the\nion composition for the single-source and multi-source solar wind structures\nand compared them with the ICME signatures determined from the kinematic and\nmagnetic field parameters of the solar wind.\n",

In this study we review performance of the geomagnetic storm\nforecasting service StormFocus during 2011--2016. The service was implemented\nin 2011 at SpaceWeather.Ru and predicts the expected strength of geomagnetic\nstorms as measured by $Dst$ index several hours ahead. The forecast is based on\nL1 solar wind and IMF measurements and is updated every hour. The solar maximum\nof cycle 24 is weak, so most of the statistics are on rather moderate storms.\nWe verify quality of selection criteria, as well as reliability of real-time\ninput data in comparison with the final values, available in archives. In\nreal-time operation 87% of storms were correctly predicted while the reanalysis\nrunning on final OMNI data predicts successfully 97% of storms. Thus the main\nreasons for prediction errors are discrepancies between real-time and final\ndata (Dst, solar wind and IMF) due to processing errors, specifics of datasets.\n",

The ionospheric\nconductor is considered in the framework of a two-dimensional approximation\nbased on high conductivity in the direction of the magnetic field. Under this\nassumption the magnetic field lines are equipotential, and the charge transfer\nbetween them is determined only by integral Pedersen and Hall conductivities.\nThe model is constructed as the first approximation in the small parameter\nexpansion of the solution of the three-dimensional problems of electrical\nconductivity. The small parameter is the ratio of Pedersen and field-aligned\nconductivities. The space distributions of the Pedersen and Hall conductivities\nare calculated using the empirical models IRI, MSISE, IGRF and applied to\nconstruct the maps of the integral conductivities. The parts of the\nmagnetosphere with high conductivity across the magnetic field lines, namely,\nthe cusps and the plasma layer are analyzed. It is shown that the connection of\nthese magnetospheric conductors to the ionosphere in parallel makes the auroral\nzones equipotential regions. As a consequence, for the ionospheric electric\nfields, which generators are located in the ionosphere or in the atmosphere,\nthe global problem of electrical conductivity is separated into three\nindependent boundary value problems in three regions: two polar caps and the\nmain part of the ionosphere which includes the mid- and low-latitude parts of\nthe ionosphere. The model can be used for the analysis of the ionospheric part\nof the Global Electric Circuit, for calculation of the ionospheric dynamo\nelectric field and as a fragment in more complex ionospheric and magnetospheric\nmodels.\n",

The exact\ndependence of this break scale on solar wind parameters has been extensively\nstudied but is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that\nreconnection may induce a break in the spectrum at a \"disruption scale\"\n$\\lambda_D$, which may be larger than the fundamental ion kinetic scales,\nproducing an unusually steep spectrum just below the break. We present a\nstatistical investigation of the dependence of the break scale on the proton\ngyroradius $\\rho_i$, ion inertial length $d_i$, ion sound radius $\\rho_s$,\nproton-cyclotron resonance scale $\\rho_c$ and disruption scale $\\lambda_D$ as a\nfunction of $\\beta_{\\perp i}$. We find that the steepest spectral indices of\nthe dissipation range occur when $\\beta_e$ is in the range of 0.1-1 and the\nbreak scale is only slightly larger than the ion sound scale (a situation\noccurring 41% of the time at 1 AU), in qualitative agreement with the\nreconnection model. In this range the break scale shows remarkably good\ncorrelation with $\\lambda_D$. Our findings suggest that, at least at low\n$\\beta_e$, reconnection may play an important role in the development of the\ndissipation range turbulent cascade and causes unusually steep (steeper than\n-3) spectral indices.\n",

We have analyzed MMS\nlocations during these these events and found that most of these electron\nleaking events were observed close to the southern high-altitude cusp and\nassociated boundaries, so these events may have a high-latitude source. Here we\npresent a new case study of observations of a MMS encounter of southern\nmagnetospheric cusp boundaries. In the magnetosheath side of the southern cusp,\nMMS observes both parallel streaming energetic ions, as well as a population\nwith 90 degree pitch angles. Subsequently, MMS detects plasma flows and\nmagnetic field rotation consistent with magnetic reconnection (operating above\nand dawn-ward of the MMS spacecraft), finally entering a depressed magnetic\nfield region with nearly stagnant flow. The depressed field region is occupied\nby high-fluxes of trapped high-energy electrons and protons, which resemble the\nCluster observations of cusp diamagnetic cavities at the northern hemisphere\n[Nykyri et al., 2011a]. However, the local magnetic field geometry during the\nprevailing IMF orientation is not favorable for magnetic reconnection to\ndirectly create a cavity in this location.

The magnetic holes are nonlinear mirror structures since their\nmagnitude is anti-correlated with particle density. In this article, we examine\nthe growth mechanisms of these whistler waves and their interaction with the\nhost magnetic hole. In the observations, as magnetic holes develop and get\ndeeper, an electron population gets trapped and develops a temperature\nanisotropy favorable for whistler waves to be generated. In addition, the\ndecrease in magnetic field magnitude and the increase in density reduces the\nelectron resonance energy, which promotes the electron cyclotron resonance. To\ninvestigate this process, we used an expanding box particle-in-cell simulations\nto produce the mirror instability, which then evolves into magnetic holes. The\nsimulation shows that whistler waves can be generated at the center and edges\nof magnetic holes, which reproduces the primary features of the MMS\nobservations. The simulation shows that the electron temperature anisotropy\ndevelops in the center of the magnetic hole once the mirror instability reaches\nits nonlinear stage of evolution. The plasma is then unstable to whistler waves\nat the minimum of the magnetic field structures. In the saturation regime of\nmirror instability, when magnetic holes are developed, the electron temperature\nanisotropy appears at the edges of the holes and electron distributions become\nmore isotropic at the magnetic field minimum. At the edges, the expansion of\nmagnetic holes decelerates the electrons which leads to temperature\nanisotropies.\n",

The diffuse aurora brightening, which corresponded\nto a region a few Re size in GSM-Y in the equatorial plane, propagated duskward\nwith an average speed of ~100 km/s. Soon after the diffuse aurora brightened,\ndiscrete aurora also brightened and extended duskward, which was consistent\nwith the motion of the foreshock transient as it swept through the\nmagnetosheath while impacting the magnetopause.

We\nuse results from three-dimensional global MHD simulations to understand what is\ncausing this localized peak in the main emission. In the simulations, the peak\noccurs every rotation period and is due to shearing motions in the magnetodisk.\nThese shearing motions are caused by heavy flux-tubes being accelerated to\nlarge azimuthal speeds at dawn. The centrifugal force acting on these\nflux-tubes is then so high that they rapidly move away from the planet. When\nthey reach noon, their azimuthal velocity decreases, thus reducing the\ncentrifugal force, and allowing the flux-tubes to move back closer to Jupiter.\nThe shearing motions associated with this periodic phenomenon locally increase\nthe field aligned currents in the simulations, thus causing a transient\nbrightness enhancement in the main auroral emission, similar to the one\nobserved by Palmaerts et al. (2014).\n",

Previous observations show\nthat about $70\\%$ of CMEs are associated with prominence eruptions. However,\nthere are only a handful of reported observations of prominence plasma\nmaterials within interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), which are the interplanetary\nmanifestations of CMEs. Moreover, approximately $4\\%$ of ICMEs exhibit the\npresence of prominence materials, and approximately $12\\%$ of magnetic clouds\n(MCs) contain prominence materials. We aim to comprehensively search for cold\nprominence materials in MCs observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\nspacecraft during 1998-2007. Using the criteria of unusual $O^{5+}$ and (or)\n$Fe^{6+}$ abundances, we examined 76 MCs observed by ACE during 1998-2007 to\nsearch for cold prominence materials. Our results revealed that out of the 76\nMCs, 27 ($36\\%$) events contained prominence material regions with\nlow-charge-state signatures. Although the fraction is still lower than the\napproximately $70\\%$ of CMEs associated with prominence eruptions, it is much\nhigher than $12\\%$.

The expected ionizing radiation dose for an astronaut\nis assessed along the Apollo 11 flight path to the Moon. With the two dose\nvalues, the expected and the measured total dose, the radiation shielding and\nthe activity of the Sun are estimated. To judge the risk or safety margin the\nradiation effects on humans are opposed. The radiation from the Sun has to be\nset to zero in the computer model to achieve the published radiation dose value\nof the Apollo 11 flight. Galactic and cosmic particles have not been modelled\neither. The Apollo 11 astronauts must have been lucky that during their flight\nthe Sun was totally quiet in the solar maximum year 1969 - and also their\ncolleagues of the subsequent Apollo flights, i.e. until 1972, where the\npublished dose values still require a quiet Sun. The here built mathematical\nmodel allows assessing the total dose of a journey to Mars by only changing the\nflight duration. Even if in the meantime much thicker and/or active radiation\nshielding is proposed the radiation risk of manned space flight to Moon and\nMars remains still huge.\n",

Indeed, in the\ncase of typical area-to-mass ratios for objects in LEO, we observed that\ndynamical resonances can be considered only in combination with the atmospheric\ndrag and for a very limited set of initial orbits. Instead, if an area\naugmentation device, as a solar sail, is available on-board the spacecraft, we\nverified that a wider range of disposal solutions become available.

The observations\nconsist of Voyager 1 measurements up to several hundred MeV/nuc in local\ninterstellar space and measurements above ~10 GeV/nuc where solar modulation\neffects are small by experiments on BESS, PAMELA and AMS-2. Using BESS and\nPAMELA measurements which agree with each other, the observed spectra for H and\nHe nuclei and the H/He ratio are well fit by source rigidity spectra for both\nnuclei which are ~P-2.24 over the entire range of rigidities corresponding to\nenergies between 10 MeV/nuc and several hundred GeV/nuc. In this case, the H/He\nrigidity source ratio is 5.0 + 1. The recent and presumably more accurate\nmeasurements of these spectra above 10 GeV/nuc made by AMS-2 do not entirely\nagree with the earlier measurements, however. In particular the H spectrum is\nfound to be steeper than that of He by about 0.10 in the spectral exponent.\nUsing the same model for galactic propagation the AMS-2 data leads to source\nspectra of H and He which are ~P-2.24 up to a break rigidity ~6-8 GV. At higher\nrigidities the He source spectrum continues to be ~P-2.24 but the required\nsource spectrum for H steepens to an index ~P-2.36 above ~8 GV and, as a\nresult, the H/He source ratio decreases with increasing rigidity using the\nAMS-2 data.\n",

We\npresent results from a careful analysis of pulsating auroral patches using\nall-sky cameras. We have identified four well-defined individual patches that\nwe follow in the patch frame of reference. In this way we avoid the space-time\nambiguity which complicates rocket and satellite measurements. We find that the\nshape of the patches is remarkably persistent with 85-100% of the patch being\nrepeated for 4.5-8.5 min. Each of the three largest patches has a temporal\ncorrelation with a negative dependence on distance, and thus does not fluctuate\nin a coherent fashion. A time-delayed response within the patches indicates\nthat the so-called streaming mode might explain the incoherency. The patches\nappear to drift differently from the SuperDARN-determined\n$\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{E}$ X $\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{B}$ convection velocity.\nHowever, in a nonrotating reference frame the patches drift with 230-287 m/s in\na north eastward direction, which is what typically could be expected for the\nconvection return flow.\n",

It is shown that the evolution of V with\nheliocentric distance r depends substantially on both the heliolatitude and the\nsolar activity cycle. Deviations from the predicted Parker's profile of V(r)\nare so considerable that cannot be explained by a scarcity of measurements or\nother technical effects. In particular, the expected smooth growth of the solar\nwind speed with r is typical only for the solar activity maximum and for low\nheliolatitudes (lower than +/-40deg), while at high latitudes, there are two\nV(r) branches: growing and falling. In the solar activity maximum, V increases\ntoward the solar pole in the North hemisphere only; however, in the South\nhemisphere, it decreases with heliolatitude. In the minimum of solar activity,\nthe profile of V(r) at low heliolatitudes has a local minimum between 2 and 5\nAU. This result is confirmed by the corresponding data from other spacecraft\n(Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10). Unexpected spatial variations in V at low\nheliolatitudes can be explained by the impact of coronal hole flows on the V(r)\nprofile since the flows incline to the ecliptic plane. To reproduce the impact\nof spatial variations of V in the polar corona on the behavior of V at low\nheliolatitudes, a stationary one-fluid ideal MHD-model is developed with\naccount of recent results on imagery of the solar wind speed in the corona up\nto 5.5 solar radii obtained on the basis of combined observations from\nSOHO/UVCS, LASCO, and Mauna Loa.\n",

The abundance of Nitric Oxide (NO), a minor species in the\nthermosphere, is an important component of energy balance here because its\nproduction comes from energy sources able to break the strong bond of molecular\nnitrogen, and infrared emissions from NO play an important role in\nthermospheric cooling. Recent studies have significantly improved our\nunderstanding of NO chemistry and its relationship to energy deposition in the\nthermospheric photochemical reactions. In this study, the chemical scheme in\nthe Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) is updated to better predict\nthe lower thermospheric NO responses to solar and geomagnetic activity. We\ninvestigate the sensitivity of the 5.3-micron NO emission to F10.7 and Ap\nindices by comparing the global integrated emission from GITM with an empirical\nproxy derived from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission\nRadiometry measurements. GITM's total emission agrees well within 20% of the\nempirical values. The updated chemistry scheme significantly elevates the level\nof integrated emission compared to the previous scheme.

We report the first turbulence\nstudies of ion and electron velocity moments accumulated in pristine solar wind\nby the Fast Particle Investigation instrument onboard the Magnetospheric\nMultiscale (MMS) Mission. Use of these data is made possible by a novel\nimplementation of a frequency domain Hampel filter, described herein. After\npresenting procedures for processing of the data, we discuss statistical\nproperties of solar wind turbulence extending into the kinetic range. Magnetic\nfield fluctuations dominate electron and ion velocity fluctuation spectra\nthroughout the energy-containing and inertial ranges. However, a\nmulti-spacecraft analysis indicates that at scales shorter than the\nion-inertial length, electron velocity fluctuations become larger than ion\nvelocity and magnetic field fluctuations. The kurtosis of ion velocity peaks\naround few ion-inertial lengths and returns to near gaussian value at sub-ion\nscales.\n",

The size of the region affected by the HFA was\nestimated by using two different methods. We found that the size is mainly\ninfluenced by the magnetic shear and the angle between the discontinuity normal\nand the Sun-Earth direction.

In the 1990s these features were studied, observed and\nsimulated very intensively and many new missions focused the attention to this\nphenomenon again. Many basic features and the HFA formation mechanism were\nclarified observationally and using hybrid simulation techniques. We described\nprevious observational, theoretical and simulation results in the research\nfield of HFAs. We introduced HFA observations performed at the Earth, Mars,\nVenus and Saturn in this paper. We share different observation results of space\nmission to give an overview to the reader. Cluster multi-spacecraft\nmeasurements gave us more observed HFA events and finer, more sophisticated\nmethods to understand them better. In this study, HFAs were studied using\nobservations of the Cluster magnetometer and the Cluster plasma detector aboard\nthe four Cluster spacecraft. Energetic particle measurements (28.2-68.9 keV)\nwere also used to detect and select HFAs. We studied several specific features\nof tangential discontinuities generating HFAs on the basis of Cluster\nmeasurements in the period February-April 2003, December 2005-April 2006 and\nJanuary-April, 2007, when the separation of spacecraft was large and the\nCluster fleet reached the bow shock. We have confirmed the condition for\nforming HFAs, that the solar wind speed is higher than the average. This\ncondition was also confirmed by simultaneous ACE magnetic field and solar wind\nplasma observations at the L1 point 1.4 million km upstream of the Earth. The\nmeasured and calculated features of HFA events were compared with the results\nof different previous hybrid simulations. During the whole spring season of\n2003, the solar wind speed was higher than the average. Here we checked whether\nthe higher solar wind speed is a real condition of HFA formation also in 2006\nand 2007.\n",

We track the leading SEIMF or equivalent\ncurrent systems of similar type by intermonthly spatial correlation and apply\ngraph theory to (objectively) group their appearance and relative importance\nthroughout a solar cycle, revealing seasonal and solar cycle variation. In this\nway, we identify the spatiotemporal patterns that maximally contribute to SEIMF\nvariability over a solar cycle. We propose this combination of EOF and graph\ntheory as a powerful method for objectively defining and investigating the\nstructure and variability of the SEIMF or their equivalent ionospheric currents\nfor use in both geomagnetism and space weather applications.

For comparison, the lidar\nzonal wind measurements are averaged over the same time and altitude as the\nmeteor radar wind measurements. High cross correlations ($\\sim$0.8) are found\nin all height regions. The discrepancies can be explained in light of\ndifferences in the observational volumes of the two instruments. Further, we\nextended the comparison to address the electric field and/or ionization impact\non the neutral wind estimation. For the periods of low ionization, the neutral\nwinds estimated with both instruments are quite consistent with each other.\nDuring periods of elevated ionization, comparatively large differences are\nnoticed at the highermost altitude, which might be due to the electric field\nand/or ionization impact on the wind estimation.

Major warmings occur roughly every second winter in the\nNorthern Hemisphere (NH), but has only been observed once in the Southern\nHemisphere (SH), during the Antarctic winter of 2002. Observations by the\nGlobal Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS, an instrument on board\nEnvisat) during this rare event, show a 40% increase of ozone in the nighttime\nsecondary ozone layer at subpolar latitudes compared to non-SSW years. This\nstudy investigates the cause of the mesospheric nighttime ozone increase, using\nthe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community\nClimate Model with specified dynamics (SD-WACCM). The 2002 SH winter was\ncharacterized by several reductions of the strength of the polar night jet in\nthe upper stratosphere before the jet reversed completely, marking the onset of\nthe major SSW. At the time of these wind reductions, corresponding episodic\nincreases can be seen in the modelled nighttime secondary ozone layer. This\nozone increase is attributed largely to enhanced upwelling and the associated\ncooling of the altitude region in conjunction with the wind reversal. This is\nin correspondence to similar studies of SSW induced ozone enhancements in NH.\nBut unlike its NH counterpart, the SH secondary ozone layer appeared to be\nimpacted less by episodic variations in atomic hydrogen. Seasonally decreasing\natomic hydrogen plays however a larger role in SH compared to NH.\n",

The corresponding ionospheric convection has\nrevealed that footprints in one hemisphere tend to move faster to reduce the\ndisplacement, a process we refer to as the restoring of symmetry. Although the\ninfluence on the return flow convection from the process of restoring symmetry\nhas been shown to be strongly controlled by the IMF, the influence from\ninternal magnetospheric processes has been less investigated. We use 14 years\nof line-of-sight measurements of the ionospheric plasma convection from the\nSuper Dual Auroral Radar Network to produce high-latitude convection maps\nsorted by season, IMF, and geomagnetic activity. We find that the restoring\nsymmetry flows dominate the average convection pattern in the nightside\nionosphere during low levels of magnetotail activity. For increasing\nmagnetotail activity, signatures of the restoring symmetry process become less\nand less pronounced in the global average convection maps. We suggest that tail\nreconnection acts to reduce the asymmetric state of the closed magnetosphere by\nremoving the asymmetric pressure distribution in the tail set up by the IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{y}$ interaction. During active periods the nightside magnetosphere\nwill therefore reach a more symmetric configuration on a global scale. These\nresults are relevant for better understanding the dynamics of flux tubes in the\nasymmetric geospace, which is the most common state of the system.\n",

The normal direction is most accurately\nobtained by MDD-$B$. Overall, we find that these techniques were able to\nidentify $E_M$ from the virtual data within error bars $\\geq$20\\%.\n",

        "summary": "  Knowledge of Mars's ionosphere has been significantly advanced in recent\nyears by observations from Mars Express (MEX) and lately MAVEN. A topic of\nparticular interest are the interactions between the planet's ionospheric\nplasma and its highly structured crustal magnetic fields, and how these lead to\nthe redistribution of plasma and affect the propagation of radio waves in the\nsystem. In this paper, we elucidate a possible relationship between two\nanomalous radar signatures previously reported in observations from the MARSIS\ninstrument on MEX. Relatively uncommon observations of localized, extreme\nincreases in the ionospheric peak density in regions of radial (cusp-like)\nmagnetic fields and spread-echo radar signatures are shown to be coincident\nwith ducting of the same radar pulses at higher altitudes on the same field\nlines. We suggest that these two observations are both caused by a high\nelectric field (perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$) having distinctly different\neffects in two altitude regimes. At lower altitudes, where ions are\ndemagnetized and electrons magnetized, and recombination dominantes, a high\nelectric field causes irregularities, plasma turbulence, electron heating,\nslower recombination and ultimately enhanced plasma densities. However, at\nhigher altitudes, where both ions and electrons are magnetized and atomic\noxygen ions cannot recombine directly, the high electric field instead causes\nfrictional heating, a faster production of molecular ions by charge exchange,\nand so a density decrease. The latter enables ducting of radar pulses on closed\nfield lines, in an analogous fashion to inter-hemispheric ducting in the\nEarth's ionosphere.\n",

Similar to what\nhas been seen in earlier research, the ensuing instability leads to the\nformation of propagating electrostatic solitons. We show here that this region\nof strong electrostatic turbulence is the predominant electron heating site\nwhen transiting from inflow to outflow. The heating is the result of heating\ngenerated by electrostatic turbulence driven by overlapping beams, and its\nmacroscopic effect is a quasi-viscous contribution to the overall electron\nenergy balance.

        "summary": "  The Sun is a highly dynamic environment that exhibits dynamic behavior on\nmany different timescales. In particular, coronal holes exhibit temporal and\nspatial variability. Signatures of these coronal dynamics are inherited by the\ncoronal hole wind streams that originate in these regions and can effect the\nEarth's magnetosphere. Both the cause of the observed variabilities and how\nthese translate to fluctuations in the in situ observed solar wind is not yet\nfully understood. During solar activity minimum the structure of the magnetic\nfield typically remains stable over several Carrington rotations (CRs). But how\nstable is the solar magnetic field? Here, we address this question by analyzing\nthe evolution of a coronal hole structure and the corresponding coronal hole\nwind stream emitted from this source region over 12 consecutive CRs in 2006. To\nthis end, we link in situ observations of Solar Wind Ion Composition\nSpectrometer (SWICS) onboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) with\nsynoptic maps of Michelson Doppler imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO) at the photospheric level through a combination of ballistic\nback-mapping and a potential field source surface (PFSS) approach. Together,\nthese track the evolution of the open field line region that is identified as\nthe source region of a recurring coronal hole wind stream.\n  We find that the shape of the open field line region and to some extent also\nthe solar wind properties are influenced by surrounding more dynamic closed\nloop regions. We show that the freeze-in order can change within a coronal hole\nwind stream on small timescales and illustrate a mechanism that can cause\nchanges in the freeze-in order. The inferred minimal temperature profile is\nvariable even within coronal hole wind and is in particular most variable in\nthe outer corona.\n",

Despite these similarities,\nthe RPWS/LP measured density differed a factor of 5 between the passes. This\ndifference was present, and similar, both inbound and outbound. Two distinct\nelectron peaks were present during T118, at 1150 km and 1200 km, suggesting\nvery localised plasma production. During T118, from 1200-1350 km and below 1100\nkm, the lowest electron density ever observed in Titan's ionosphere are\nreported. We suggest that an exceptionally low rate of particle impact\nionisation in combination with increased dynamics in the ionosphere could be\nthe cause.

We discuss charge exchange with solar\nwind particles, photoionization, and electron impact ionization for hydrogen,\noxygen, neon, and helium from 1985 to 2018 both in the ecliptic plane and in\nthe polar regions. We discuss ionization rates as a function of time, distance\nto the Sun, and latitude. We compare the total ionization rates among the\nspecies within a consistent and homogeneous system of calculation of the\nionization rates. The highest total ionization rates at 1 au in the ecliptic\nplane are for hydrogen and oxygen, and the lowest are for helium. In the polar\nregions, the strongest ionization losses are for oxygen, regardless of the\nsolar activity. Photoionization is the dominant ionization reaction for helium\nand neon, and a reaction of high significance for oxygen. Charge exchange with\nsolar wind particles is the dominant ionization reaction for hydrogen and the\nsecond important ionization reaction for oxygen. Electron impact ionization is\nan important ionization reaction for Ne and He, with the contribution to the\ntotal ionization rates stronger within 1 au and smaller outside. The total\nionization rates for He and Ne vary in time with the solar activity, whereas\nthe total ionization rates for H and O follow the cyclic solar wind variations\nout of the ecliptic plane and aperiodic variations in the ecliptic plane.\n",

More recently, potential environmental benefits for asteroid mining\nhave been considered. However, no quantitative estimate of these benefits has\nbeen given. This paper attempts to determine if and under which conditions\nasteroid mining would have environmental benefits, compared to either\nEarth-based mining or launching equipment and resources into space. We focus on\ntwo cases: Water supply to cis-lunar orbit and platinum mining. First, we\nconduct a state-of-the-art of current environmental life cycle assessment for\nthe space domain and platinum mining. Second, a first order environmental life\ncycle assessment is conducted, including goal and scope definition, inventory\nanalysis, and impact assessment. We compare water supply to cis-lunar orbit\nwith and without asteroid mining and go on to compare terrestrial with\nspace-based platinum mining. The results indicate that asteroid water mining\nwould have environmental benefits, as soon as the amount of water supplied via\nmining is larger than the mass of the spacecraft used for mining. For platinum\nmining, we find that by comparing the operations phase of terrestrial and space\nmining, space mining would have a lower environmental impact, if the spacecraft\nis able to return between 0.3 to 7% of its mass in platinum to Earth, assuming\n100% primary platinum or 100% secondary platinum, respectively. For future\nwork, we propose a more detailed analysis, based on a more precise inventory\nand a larger system boundary, including the production of the launcher and\nspacecraft.\n",

Such long duration strong southward\nmagnetic field is often associated with ICMEs, torsional Alfven fluctuations\nsuperposed co-rotating interacting regions (CIRs) and fast solar wind streams.\nTorsional Alfven fluctuations embedded CIRs have been known for a long, however\nmagnetic cloud embedded with such fluctuations are rarely observed.

The present work\nconfirms the torsional Alfven waves in a magnetic cloud associated with a CME\nlaunched on 15th February which impacted the Earth's magnetosphere on February\n18, 2011.

This description uses\nelectron spectra measured at 5 different epochs and distances within the\nheliosheath. The diffusion dependence needed to explain the remarkable solar\nmodulation effects observed for both electrons and higher rigidity protons as\none progresses from the heliopause inward by ~25 AU to the termination shock\nreally has two distinct rigidity regimes. Above a rigidity ~Pc the diffusion\ncoefficient has a dependence ~beta P, the modulation is ~P and its magnitude\nincreases linearly with radius in AU according to the integral of dr/K. This\nintegral defines a potential, beta, called the modulation potential, thus\nexplaining the proton variations. At rigidities <Pc, the diffusion coefficient\nis ~beta and independent of rigidity. The modulation is also independent of\nrigidity but its magnitude depends on the modulation potential, thus explaining\nthe electron modulation. One needs both electron and proton observations,\ntogether, to recognize the physical description of the solar modulation\nprocess. For the first time we have been able, using proton data at high\nrigidities and electron data at low rigidities, to put together a picture of\nthe high and low rigidity diffusion coefficients and how they affect energetic\nparticles in an astrophysical scale environment.\n",

The\nbest performers, on the other hand, maintained a mean error (bias) of -1 hour,\na mean absolute error of 13 hours, and a precision (s.d.) of 15 hours.

Res.,\nthis work applies AtRIS with a specific implementation of the Martian\natmospheric and regolith structure to model the radiation environment at Mars.\nWe benchmark these first modeling results based on different GEANT4 physics\nlists with the energetic particle spectra recently measured by the Radiation\nAssessment Detector (RAD) on the surface of Mars. The good agreement between\nAtRIS and the actual measurement provides one of the first and sound\nvalidations of AtRIS and the preferred physics list which could be recommended\nfor predicting the radiation field of other conceivable (exo)planets with an\natmospheric environment similar to Mars.\n",

We here\nstudy the occurrence and structure of OGH flux, as seen in near-Earth space\n(r=1AU) and by the Helios spacecraft at 0.29<r<1AU, in order to evaluate the\ncontributions to OGH flux generation of the various mechanisms and factors that\nare not accounted for in Parker spiral theory. We study the loss of OGH flux\nwith increasing averaging timescale between 16 seconds and 100 hours and so\ndetermine its spectrum of scale sizes. OGH flux at sunspot minimum is shown to\nbe more common than at sunspot maximum and caused by smaller-scale structure in\nthe HMF, with a mode temporal scale at a fixed point of 10hrs compared to\n40hrs. OGH generated by rotating the HMF through the radial direction is also\nshown to differ in its spectrum of scale sizes from that generated by rotating\nthe HMF through the tangential direction: the former does not contribute to the\nexcess open heliospheric flux at a given r but the latter does. We show that\nroughly half of the HMF deflection from the ideal Parker spiral giving OGH at\nEarth occurs at r below 0.3AU. We highlight some questions which can be\naddressed by the Parker Solar Probe mission which will study the HMF down to\nr=0.046AU.\n",

In addition to the spatial\ndistribution of causative lightning discharges, we calculate the transmission\nratio of lightning discharges into ground detectable whistlers as a function of\nlocation. Our method relies on the time of the whistlers and the time and\nsource location of spherics from a global lightning database. We apply this\nmethod to whistlers recorded at fifteen ground based stations in the AWDANet\n(Automatic Whistler Detector and Analyzer Network) operating between 2007-2018\nand to located lightning strokes from the WWLLN (World Wide Lightning Location\nNetwork) database.

Our results show that the source region of whistlers\ncorresponding to each ground station is around the magnetic conjugate point of\nthe respective station. The size of the source region is typically less than\n2000 km in radius with a small fraction of sources extending to up to 3500 km.\nThe transmission ratio is maximal at the conjugate point and decreases with\nincreasing distance from it. This conforms to the theory that whistlers\ndetected on the ground propagated in a ducted mode through the plasmasphere and\nthus the lightning strokes of their causative spherics must cluster around the\nfootprint of the ducts in the other hemisphere.

The ESA/Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko\n(67P) provided a unique opportunity to study charge-changing processes in situ.\nAn extended analytical formalism describing solar wind charge-changing\nprocesses at comets along solar wind streamlines is presented. It is based on a\nthorough book-keeping of available charge-changing cross sections of hydrogen\nand helium particles in a water gas. After presenting a general 1D solution of\ncharge exchange at comets, we study the theoretical dependence of charge-state\ndistributions of (He$^{2+}$, He$^+$, He$^0$) and (H$^+$, H$^0$, H$^-$) on solar\nwind parameters at comet 67P. We show that double charge exchange for the\nHe$^{2+}$-H$_2$O system plays an important role below a solar wind bulk speed\nof 200 km/s , resulting in the production of He energetic neutral atoms,\nwhereas stripping reactions can in general be neglected. Retrievals of\noutgassing rates and solar wind upstream fluxes from local Rosetta measurements\ndeep in the coma are discussed. Solar wind ion temperature effects at 400 km/s\nsolar wind speed are well contained during the Rosetta mission. As the comet\napproaches perihelion, the model predicts a sharp decrease of solar wind ion\nfluxes by almost one order of magnitude at the location of Rosetta, forming in\neffect a solar wind ion cavity.

We\nfocus on the influence of varying solar wind velocities on the energy changes\nof SEPs, and study how a non-Parker background solar wind can trap particles\ntemporarily at small heliocentric radial distances (r<1.5 AU). Our model\ncomputes particle distributions by solving the focused transport equation (FTE)\nin a stochastic manner by propagating particles in a solar wind generated by\nthe heliospheric MHD model EUHFORIA. We solve the FTE, including all solar wind\neffects and cross-field diffusion. As initial conditions, we inject 4 MeV\nprotons impulsively, and spread uniformly over a selected region at the inner\nboundary of the model. To verify the model, we first assume nominal undisturbed\nfast and slow solar winds. Thereafter, we analyse the propagation of particles\nin a solar wind containing a corotating interaction region (CIR). The\nintensity-time profiles obtained in the simulations using the nominal solar\nwinds illustrate the considerable adiabatic deceleration undergone by SEPs when\npropagating in a fast solar wind. For the solar wind containing a CIR, we\nobserve particles accelerating when propagating in the compression and shock\nwaves bounding the CIR. These waves and the magnetic configuration near the\nstream interface also act as a magnetic mirror, producing long-lasting high\nintensities at small radial distances. We also illustrate how the efficiency of\nthe cross-field diffusion in the heliosphere is altered due to compressed\nmagnetic fields. Finally, cross-field diffusion enables some particles to reach\nthe forward shock wave, resulting in the formation of an accelerated particle\npopulation centred on the forward shock, despite the lack of magnetic\nconnection between the particle injection region and this shock wave.\n",

The ESA/Rosetta mission to\ncomet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) provides a unique opportunity to study\ncharge-changing processes in situ. To understand the role of these reactions in\nthe evolution of the solar wind plasma, and interpret the complex in-situ\nmeasurements made by Rosetta, numerical or analytical models are necessary. We\nuse an extended analytical formalism describing solar wind charge-changing\nprocesses at comets along solar wind streamlines. The model is driven by solar\nwind ion measurements from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium-Ion Composition\nAnalyzer (RPC-ICA) and neutral density observations from the Rosetta\nSpectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis-Comet Pressure Sensor (ROSINA-COPS),\nas well as charge-changing cross sections of hydrogen and helium particles in a\nwater gas. A mission-wide overview of charge-changing efficiencies at comet 67P\nis presented. Electron capture cross sections dominate and favor the production\nof He and H energetic neutral atoms, with fluxes expected to rival those of H+\nand He2+ ions. Neutral outgassing rates are retrieved from local RPC-ICA flux\nmeasurements, and match ROSINA's estimates very well. From the model, we find\nthat solar wind charge exchange is unable to fully explain the magnitude of the\nsharp drop of solar wind ion fluxes observed by Rosetta for heliocentric\ndistances below 2.5 AU. This is likely because the model does not take into\naccount the relative ion dynamics and, to a lesser extent, ignore the formation\nof bow shock-like structures upstream of the nucleus. This work also shows that\nthe ionization by solar EUV radiation and energetic electrons dominates the\nsource of cometary ions, although solar wind contributions may be significant\nduring isolated events.\n",

It was proposed\nthat impulses acting on the boundary might lead to a trapping of these waves on\nthe dayside by the ionosphere, resulting in a standing wave or eigenmode of the\nmagnetopause surface. No direct observational evidence of this has been found\nto date and searches for indirect evidence have proved inconclusive, leading to\nspeculation that this mechanism might not occur. By using fortuitous multipoint\nspacecraft observations during a rare isolated fast plasma jet impinging on the\nboundary, here we show that the resulting magnetopause motion and\nmagnetospheric ultra-low frequency waves at well-defined frequencies are in\nagreement with and can only be explained by the magnetopause surface eigenmode.\nWe therefore show through direct observations that this mechanism, which should\nimpact upon the magnetospheric system globally, does in fact occur.\n",

Today designated 1I/'Oumuamua, it shows characteristics that have\nnever before been observed in a celestial body. Due to these characteristics,\nan in-situ investigation of 1I would be of extraordinary scientific value.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible\nusing current and near-term technologies however with an anticipated launch\ndate of 2020-2021, this is too soon to be realistic. This paper aims at\naddressing the question of the feasibility of a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua in 2024\nand beyond. Using the OITS trajectory simulation tool, various scenarios are\nanalyzed, including a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, a\nJupiter powered flyby, and more complex flyby schemes including a Mars and\nVenus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, we\nidentify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a launch date in 2033, a total\nvelocity increment of 18.2 km/s, and arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2048. With an\nadditional deep space maneuver before the powered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory\nwith a launch date in 2030, a total velocity increment of 15.3 km/s, and an\narrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2052 were identified. Both launch dates would\nprovide over a decade for spacecraft development, in contrast to the previously\nidentified 2020-2021 launch dates. Furthermore, the distance from the Sun at\nthe Oberth burn is at 5 Solar radii. This results in heat flux values, which\nare of the same order of magnitude as for the Parker Solar Probe. We conclude\nthat a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using existing and near-term\ntechnologies and there is sufficient time for developing such a mission.\n",

To understand these processes and place them in the context of a\nsolar wind plasma interacting with a neutral atmosphere, numerical or\nanalytical models are necessary. Inputs of these models, such as collision\ncross sections and chemistry, are crucial.\n  Book-keeping and fitting of experimentally measured charge-changing and\nionization cross sections of hydrogen and helium particles in a water gas are\ndiscussed, with emphasis on the low-energy/low-velocity range that is\ncharacteristic of solar wind bulk speeds ($< 20$ keV u$^{-1}$/$2000$ km\ns$^{-1}$).\n  We provide polynomial fits for cross sections of charge-changing and\nionization reactions, and list the experimental needs for future studies.

The plasma in\nthe coma appeared very dynamic, and many factors control its variability. Aims.\nWe wish to identify the effects of solar flares on the comet plasma and also\ntheir effect on the measurements by the Langmuir Probe Instrument (LAP).\nMethods. To identify the effects of flares, we proceeded from an existing flare\ncatalog of Earth-directed solar flares, from which a new list was created that\nonly included Rosetta-directed flares. We also used measurements of flares at\nMars when at similar longitudes as Rosetta. The flare irradiance spectral model\n(FISM v.1) and its Mars equivalent (FISM-M) produce an extreme-ultraviolet\n(EUV) irradiance (10-120 nm) of the flares at 1 min resolution. LAP data and\ndensity measurements obtained with the Mutual Impedence Probe (MIP) from the\ntime of arrival of the flares at Rosetta were examined to determine the flare\neffects. Results. From the vantage point of Earth, 1504 flares directed toward\nRosetta occurred during the mission. In only 24 of these, that is, 1.6%, was\nthe increase in EUV irradiance large enough to cause an observable effect in\nLAP data. Twenty-four Mars-directed flares were also observed in Rosetta data.\nThe effect of the flares was to increase the photoelectron current by typically\n1-5 nA. We find little evidence that the solar flares increase the plasma\ndensity, at least not above the background variability. Conclusions. Solar\nflares have a small effect on the photoelectron current of the LAP instrument,\nand they are not significant in comparison to other factors that control the\nplasma density in the coma. The photoelectron current can only be used for\nflare detection during periods of calm plasma conditions.\n",

Here we\nreport detailed observations of an ICME compressing Mercury's dayside\nmagnetosphere to the surface. A fast CME launched from the Sun on November 29\n2013 impacted first MESSENGER, which was orbiting Mercury, on November 30 and\nlater STEREO-A near 1 AU on December 1. Following the ICME impact, MESSENGER\nremained in the solar wind as the spacecraft traveled inwards and northwards\ntowards Mercury's surface until it reached and passed its closest approach to\nthe planet (at 371 km altitude) without crossing into the magnetosphere. The\nmagnetospheric crossing finally occurred 1 minute before reaching the planet's\nnightside at 400 km altitude and 84$^\\circ$N latitude, indicating the lack of\ndayside magnetosphere on this orbit. In addition, the peak magnetic field\nmeasured by MESSENGER at this time was 40% above the values measured in the\norbits just prior to and after the ICME, a consequence of the magnetospheric\ncompression. Using both a proxy method at Mercury and measurements at STEREO-A,\nwe show that the extremely high ram pressure associated with this ICME was more\nthan high enough to collapse Mercury's weak magnetosphere. As a consequence,\nthe ICME plasma likely interacted with Mercury's surface, evidenced by enhanced\nsodium ions in the exosphere. The collapse of Mercury's dayside magnetosphere\nhas important implications for the habitability of close-in exoplanets around M\ndwarf stars, as such events may significantly contribute to planetary\natmospheric loss in these systems.\n",

To\nmodel the energetic protons, we used a recently developed particle transport\ncode that computes particle distributions in the heliosphere by solving the\nfocused transport equation in a stochastic manner. The particles are propagated\nin a solar wind containing a CIR, which was generated by the heliospheric\nmagnetohydrodynamic model, EUHFORIA. We study four cases in which we assume a\ndelta injection of 4 MeV protons spread uniformly over different regions at the\ninner boundary of the model. These source regions have the same size and shape,\nyet are shifted in longitude from each other, and are therefore magnetically\nconnected to different solar wind conditions. The intensity and anisotropy\nprofiles along selected IMF lines vary strongly according to the different\nsolar wind conditions encountered along the field line. The IMF lines crossing\nthe shocks bounding the CIR show the formation of accelerated particle\npopulations, with the reverse shock wave being a more efficient accelerator\nthan the forward shock wave. Moreover, we demonstrate that the longitudinal\nwidth of the particle intensity distribution can increase, decrease, or remain\nconstant with heliographic radial distance, reflecting the underlying IMF\nstructure. Finally, we show how the deflection of the IMF at the shock waves\nand the compression of the IMF in the CIR deforms the three-dimensional shape\nof the particle distribution in such a way that the original shape of the\ninjection profile is lost.\n",

Ordinary CMEs are frequently associated\nwith prominence eruptions,and cool prominencematerialsare found within some\nmagnetic clouds (MCs). Therefore, the predicted small CMEs may also be\nfrequently associated with small prominence eruptions. In this work, we aim to\nsearch for cool prominence materials within SMFRs.We examined all the O5+ and\nFe6+ fraction data obtained by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft\nduring 1998 to 2008 and found that 13 SMFRs might exhibit low-charge-state\nsignatures of unusual O5+and/or Fe6+abundances.One of the 13 SMFRs also\nexhibited signatures of high ionic charge states. We also reported a SMFR with\nhighFe6+ fraction, but the values of Fe6+is a little lower than the threshold\ndefining unusualFe6+.However, the SDO/AIA observations confirmed that the\nprogenitor CME of this SMFR is associated with a small eruptive prominence, and\nthe observations also supported the prominence materials were embedded in the\nCME.These observations are at the edge of the capabilities of ACE/SWICS and it\ncannot be ruled out that they are solely caused by instrumental effects. If\nthese observations are real, they provide new evidence for the conjecture that\nSMFRs are small-scale MCs but also imply that the connected small CMEs could be\nassociated with flares and prominence eruptions.\n",

We emphasize especially that some MeV electrons are observed in low\nquantities in the inner belt, even during periods when they are not observed by\nVan Allen Probe (VAP). We show that they are not due to proton contamination\nbut to clear injections of particles from the outer belt during strong\ngeomagnetic storms of March and June 2015, and September 2017. Electrons with\nlower energy are injected also during less strong storms and the L-shell of the\nelectron flux peak in the outer belt shifts inward with a high dependence on\nthe electron energy. With the new high resolution EPT instrument, we can study\nthe dynamics of relativistic electrons, including MeV electrons in the inner\nradiation belt, revealing how and when such electrons are injected into the\ninner belt and how long they reside there before being scattered into the\nEarth's atmosphere or lost by other mechanisms.\n",

In our\nprevious studies, we obtained important relationships that enable calculating\nthe key parameters at transition through the bow shock front. One of the most\nimportant sources of information on physical processes at the heliosphere\nboundary are the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts. Since both the solar wind and\ninterstellar medium are supersonic streams, two shocks are formed when flowing\naround the heliopause. The internal shock, in which the solar wind decelerates\nto subsonic velocity, is called the heliospheric shock. In the external bow\nshock, the interstellar gas supersonic flux is decelerated. The aim of this\npaper is to generalize the previously obtained equations to the processes in\nthe external bow shock region. If Voyager-1 was equipped with a greater set of\nmeasuring instruments, we could have already provided estimations of the\ninterstellar medium key parameters, and described in physical terms what this\nmedium is, using relationships and equations from our studies.\n",

Steady solar wind\nstreams modulate the propagation behaviour of interplanetary coronal mass\nejections and are themselves an important driver of recurrent geomagnetic storm\nactivity. The knowledge of the ambient solar wind flows and fields is thus an\nessential component of successful space weather forecasting. Here, we present\nan implementation of an operational framework for operating, validating and\noptimizing models of the ambient solar wind flow on the example of Carrington\nRotation 2077. We reconstruct the global topology of the coronal magnetic field\nusing the potential field source surface model (PFSS) and the Schatten current\nsheet model (SCS), and discuss three empirical relationships for specifying the\nsolar wind conditions near the Sun, namely the Wang-Sheeley (WS) model, the\ndistance from the coronal hole boundary (DCHB) model, and the Wang-Sheeley-Arge\n(WSA) model. By adding uncertainty in the latitude about the sub-Earth point,\nwe select an ensemble of initial conditions and map the solutions to Earth by\nthe Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation (HUX) model. We assess the forecasting\nperformance from a continuous variable validation, and find that the WSA model\nmost accurately predicts the solar wind speed time series. We note that the\nprocess of ensemble forecasting slightly improves the forecasting performance\nof all solar wind models investigated.

Lundquist fitting has been applied to the flux ropes and the\nrope orientations have been determined; macroscale differences in the profiles\nat the aligned spacecraft may be ascribed to differences in flux rope\norientation. Assuming that the same region of the ICME was observed by the\naligned spacecraft in each case, the fitting indicates some weak tendency for\nthe rope axes to reduce in inclination relative to the solar equatorial plane\nand to align with the solar east-west direction with heliocentric distance.\n",

The solar wind\nvelocity distribution is represented using $\\kappa$-functions, which are\ntransformed in response to simulated shock transitions in the fixed-frame flow\nspeed, plasma number density, and temperature. These heated solar wind\ndistributions are specified as source spectra at the shock from which particles\nwith sufficient energy can be injected into the diffusive shock acceleration\nprocess. It is shown that for shock-accelerated spectra to display the\nclassically expected power-law indices associated with the compression ratio,\ndiffusion length scales must exceed the width of the compression region. The\nmaximum attainable energies of shock-accelerated spectra are found to be\nlimited by the transit times of interplanetary shocks, while spectra may be\naccelerated to higher energies in the presence of higher levels of magnetic\nturbulence or at faster-moving shocks. Indeed, simulations suggest fast-moving\nshocks are more likely to produce very high-energy particles, while strong\nshocks, associated with harder shock-accelerated spectra, are linked to higher\nintensities of energetic particles. The prior heating of the solar wind\ndistribution is found to complement shock acceleration in reproducing the\nintensities of typical energetic storm particle events, especially where\ninjection energies are high. Moreover, simulations of $\\sim$0.2 to 1 MeV proton\nintensities are presented that naturally reproduce the observed flat energy\nspectra prior to shock passages. Energetic particles accelerated from the solar\nwind, aided by its prior heating, are shown to contribute substantially to\nintensities during energetic storm particle events.\n",

We present a statistical\nanalysis of magnetic field fluctuations in the whistler frequency range (above\n16 Hz) based on about 801,500 magnetic field spectra measured over three years\naboard ARTEMIS spacecraft in the pristine solar wind. About 13,700 spectra (30\nhours in total) with intense magnetic field fluctuations satisfy the\ninterpretation in terms of quasi-parallel whistler waves. We provide estimates\nof the whistler wave occurrence probability, amplitudes, frequencies and\nbandwidths. The occurrence probability of whistler waves is shown to strongly\ndepend on the electron temperature anisotropy. The whistler waves amplitudes\nare in the range from about 0.01 to 0.1 nT and typically below 0.02 of the\nbackground magnetic field. The frequencies of the whistler waves are shown to\nbe below an upper bound that is dependent on $\\beta_{e}$. The correlations\nestablished between the whistler wave properties and local macroscopic plasma\nparameters suggest that the observed whistler waves can be generated in local\nplasmas by the whistler heat flux instability. The whistler wave amplitudes are\ntypically small, which questions the hypothesis that quasi-parallel whistler\nwaves are capable to regulate the electron heat flux in the solar wind.

        "summary": "  Today, the near-Earth space is facing a paradigm change as the number of new\nspacecraft is literally sky-rocketing. Increasing numbers of small satellites\nthreaten the sustainable use of space, as without removal, space debris will\neventually make certain critical orbits unusable. A central factor affecting\nsmall spacecraft health and leading to debris is the radiation environment,\nwhich is unpredictable due to an incomplete understanding of the near-Earth\nradiation environment itself and its variability driven by the solar wind and\nouter magnetosphere. This paper presents the FORESAIL-1 nanosatellite mission,\nhaving two scientific and one technological objectives. The first scientific\nobjective is to measure the energy and flux of energetic particle loss to the\natmosphere with a representative energy and pitch angle resolution over a wide\nrange of magnetic local times. To pave the way to novel model - in situ data\ncomparisons, we also show preliminary results on precipitating electron fluxes\nobtained with the new global hybrid-Vlasov simulation Vlasiator. The second\nscientific objective of the FORESAIL-1 mission is to measure energetic neutral\natoms (ENAs) of solar origin. The solar ENA flux has the potential to\ncontribute importantly to the knowledge of solar eruption energy budget\nestimations. The technological objective is to demonstrate a satellite\nde-orbiting technology, and for the first time, make an orbit manoeuvre with a\npropellantless nanosatellite. FORESAIL-1 will demonstrate the potential for\nnanosatellites to make important scientific contributions as well as promote\nthe sustainable utilisation of space by using a cost-efficient de-orbiting\ntechnology.\n",

The observed\ncontinuous emissions of STEVE are possibly caused by ionospheric electron\nheating due to heat conduction and/or auroral acceleration process powered by\nAlfven waves, both driven by the observed equatorial magnetospheric processes.\nThe observed green emissions are likely optical manifestations of electron\nprecipitations associated with wave structures traveling along the plasmapause.\nThe observed SAR arc at lower latitudes likely corresponds to the formation of\nlow-energy plasma inside the plasmapause by Coulomb collisions between ring\ncurrent ions and plasmaspheric plasma.\n",

In order to assess the accuracy of the Ap model, we compare the modeled\nelectron fluxes with estimates of the loss cone fluxes using both detectors in\ncombination with electron pitch angle distributions from theory of\nwave-particle interactions. The Ap model falls short in respect to reproducing\nthe flux level and variability associated with strong geomagnetic storms (Ap\n$>$ 40) as well as the duration of corotating interaction region storms causing\na systematic bias within a solar cycle. As the Ap-parameterized fluxes reach a\nplateau for Ap $>$ 40, the model's ability to reflect the flux level of\nprevious solar cycles associated with generally higher Ap values is questioned.\nThe objective of this comparison is to understand the potential uncertainty in\nthe energetic particle precipitation applying the CMIP6 particle energy input\nin order to assess its subsequent impact on the atmosphere.\n",

A recently developed mapping approach is generalised to use a more\nadvanced solar wind model that includes the effects of solar wind acceleration,\nnon-radial intrinsic magnetic fields and flows at the source surface/inner\nboundary, and conservation of angular momentum. The field lines are mapped by\nstepping along local magnetic field $\\bm{B}$ and via a Runge-Kutta algorithm,\nleading to essentially identical maps. The new model's maps for Carrington\nrotation CR 1895 near solar minimum (19 April to 15 May 1995) and a solar\nrotation between CR 2145 and CR 2146 near solar maximum (14 January to 9\nFebruary 2014) are compared with the published maps for a constant solar wind\nmodel. The two maps are very similar on a large scale near both solar minimum\nand solar maximum, meaning that the field line orientations, winding angles,\nand connectivity generally agree very well. However, close inspection shows\nthat the field lines have notable small-scale structural differences. An\ninterpretation is that inclusion of the acceleration and intrinsic azimuthal\nvelocity has significant effects on the local structure of the magnetic field\nlines. Interestingly, the field lines are more azimuthal for the accelerating\nsolar wind model for both intervals. In addition, predictions for the pitch\nangle distributions (PADs) for suprathermal electrons agree at the $90$ --\n$95\\%$ level with observations for both solar wind models for both intervals.\n",

In particular, we consider\na mono-energetic 4 MeV proton injection over an extended region located at a\nheliographic radial distance of 0.1 AU.

We find that both\na strong cross-field diffusion and a solar wind rarefaction region are capable\nof dispersing SEPs efficiently, producing overall low particle intensities\nwhich can in some cases prevent the SEPs from being detected in-situ, since\ntheir intensity may drop below the detected pre-event intensity levels.

Under strong\nlevels of cross-field diffusion, particles cross the SI and hence both\naccelerated particle populations merge together.\n",

We can tackle this issue in two ways: 1) By\nusing multiple spacecraft measuring conditions in situ in the magnetosphere in\norder to make sense of the fundamental small scale processes that enable\ntransport and coupling, or 2) By taking a global approach to observations of\nthe conditions that prevail throughout geospace in order to quantify the global\neffects of external drivers.\n  A global approach is now being taken by a number of space missions under\ndevelopment and the first tantalising results of their exploration will be\navailable in the next decade.

        "summary": "  Plasma kinetic waves and alpha-proton differential flow are two important\nsubjects on the topic of evolution of the solar wind. Based on the Wind data\nduring 2005-2015, this paper reports that the occurrence of electromagnetic\ncyclotron waves (ECWs) near the proton cyclotron frequency significantly\ndepends on the direction of alpha-proton differential flow Vd. As Vd rotates\nfrom anti-Sunward direction to Sunward direction, the occurrence rate of ECWs\nas well as the percentage of left-handed (LH) polarized ECWs decreases\nconsiderably. In particular, it is shown that the dominant polarization changes\nfrom LH polarization to right-handed polarization during the rotation. The\ninvestigation on proton and alpha particle parameters ordered by the direction\nof Vd further illustrates that large kinetic energies of alpha-proton\ndifferential flow correspond to high occurrence rates of ECWs. These results\nare well consistent with theoretical predictions for effects of alpha-proton\ndifferential flow on proton temperature anisotropy instabilities.\n",

The present study is\nan attempt to make an assessment and characterise the coming years in terms of\nsolar activity and space radiation environment especially due to the abundance\nof highly energetic heavy ions (known as HZE charged particles). These HZE\nparticle fluxes constitute a major hazard to the astronauts and also to the\ncritical electronic components of the spacecraft. Recent data on the HZE\nspecies (from B to Ni) obtained from ACE spacecraft shows a clear enhancement\nof the particle fluxes between the solar cycle 23 and solar cycle 24 (between\nSSN peaks 2002 and 2014) due to the persisting low sunspot numbers of the\nlatter cycle. The peak values of these cosmic ray fluxes occur with a time lag\nof about a year of the corresponding minimum value of the sunspots of a\nparticular 11-year cycle which is pseudo-periodic in nature. This is\ndemonstrated by the Fourier and Wavelet transform analyses of the long duration\n(1700-2018) yearly mean sunspot number data. The same time series data is also\nused to train a Hybrid Regression Neural Network (HRNN) model to generate the\npredicted yearly mean sunspot numbers for the solar cycle 25 (2019-2031). The\nwavelet analysis of this new series of annual sunspot numbers including the\npredictions up to the end of 2031 shows a clear trend of continuation of the\nlow solar activity and hence continuation of very high HZE fluxes prevailing in\nSolar cycle 24 into the solar cycle 25 and perhaps beyond.\n",

IMPTAM traces electrons of 10\n- 100 keV energies from the plasma sheet (L = 9 Re) to inner L-shell regions.\nThe flux evolution modeled by IMPTAM is used at the low energy and outer L*\ncomputational boundaries of the VERB code (assuming a dipole approximation) to\nperform radiation belt simulations of energetic electrons. The model was tested\non the March 17th, 2013 storm, for a six-day period. Four different simulations\nwere performed and their results compared to satellites observations from Van\nAllen probes and GOES. The coupled IMPTAM-VERB model reproduces evolution and\nstorm-time features of electron fluxes throughout the studied storm in\nagreement with the satellite data (within ~0.5 orders of magnitude). Including\ndynamics of the low energy population at L* = 6.6 increases fluxes closer to\nthe heart of the belt and has a strong impact in the VERB simulations at all\nenergies. However, inclusion of magnetopause losses leads to drastic flux\ndecreases even below L* = 3. The dynamics of low energy electrons (max. 10s of\nkeV) do not affect electron fluxes at energies >= 900 keV. Since the\nIMPTAM-VERB coupled model is only driven by solar wind parameters and the Dst\nand Kp indexes, it is suitable as a forecasting tool. In this study, we\ndemonstrate that the estimation of electron dynamics with\nsatellite-data-independent models is possible and very accurate.\n",

In the case of\nmuon detectors, the main atmospheric effects are related to pressure and\ntemperature changes.

In the pressure effect analysis,\nwe found that the observed barometric coefficients show a very clear\nlogarithmic correlation with the cutoff rigidity divided by the zenith angle\ncosine.

Since in the fast solar wind fluctuations preserve the\nmodulus of the magnetic field to a good approximation, the tip of the magnetic\nfield vector is observed to move on a sphere of approximately constant radius\n|B|. We then compare statistics of solar wind measurements with that of a\nsimple model of a random walk bounded on a spherical surface. The analogy\nconsists in the fact that in both systems the geometrical constraint imposes a\nlimiting amplitude at large separations and thus introduces a break scale in\nthe power spectrum of the fluctuations, leading to a shallower slope for scales\nwhere the fluctuations amplitude becomes scale-independent. However, while in\nthe case of the random walk the saturation of the fluctuations occurs when the\npattern becomes uniform on the sphere (flat distribution of the cosine of the\nrotation angle), transitioning then to a white noise regime, in the solar wind\nmagnetic field fluctuations saturate in amplitude maintaining a preferential\ndirection. We suggest that this behaviour is due to the presence of the\nbackground interplanetary magnetic field, which keeps some long-range memory in\nthe system also when the fluctuations becomes independent of the scale. This\nlong-range correlation is a necessary ingredient in order to produce the 1/f\nspectrum observed at large scales in the solar wind.\n",

It is likely that this heating results from the dissipation of\nplasma turbulence, but the specific kinetic mechanism that produces these\npreferential effects is not known. Solar wind turbulence at proton scales is\noften characterized in terms of highly oblique kinetic Alfv\\'en waves (KAWs),\nwhich have been thought to dissipate through the Landau resonance and yield\nparallel heating. We show that the quasilinear resonant cyclotron interaction\nbetween KAWs and solar wind ions can actually produce perpendicular ion\nheating. We present an illustrative calculation of a steady, critically\nbalanced spectrum of KAWs acting on homogeneous ion distributions with a plasma\n\\b{eta} = 0.1, representative of turbulent conditions in the fast solar wind\nnear 20 Rs. The KAWs are described here by a two-fluid dispersion relation.

Alpha particles in the same\nfluctuation field are heated to similar perpendicular thermal speeds,\nequivalent to the greater than mass proportional perpendicular temperatures\nthat are commonly observed.

We particularly examine the effects of\nAlfv\\'enic and slow-mode-like fluctuations, commonly observed in the solar wind\non timescales of milliseconds to hours, on the observations. We do this by\nconstructing distribution functions from modeled observations and calculate\ntheir statistical moments in order to derive plasma bulk parameters. The\ncomparison between the derived parameters with the known input allows us to\nestimate the expected accuracy of Solar Orbiter proton measurements in the\nsolar wind under typical conditions.

Many researchers\nbelieve that all non-MC interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) also have\nmagnetic flux rope structures, which are inconspicuous because the observing\nspacecraft crosses the flanks of the rope structures. If so, the field lines of\nnon-MC ICMEs should also be usually connected to the Sun on both ends. Then we\nwant to know whether the field lines of most non-MC ICMEs are still connected\nto the sun at both ends or not. This study examined the counterstreaming\nsuprathermal electron (CSE) signatures of 266 ICMEs observed by the\n\\emph{Advanced Composition Explorer} (\\emph{ACE}) spacecraft from 1998 to 2008\nand compared the CSE signatures of MCs and non-MC ICMEs. Results show that only\n10 of the 101 MC events ($9.9\\%$ ) and 75 of the 171 non-MC events ($43.9\\%$)\nhave no CSEs. Moreover, 21 of the non-MC ICMEs have high CSE percentages (more\nthan $70\\%$) and show relatively stable magnetic field components with slight\nrotations, which are in line with the expectations that spacecraft passes\nthrough the flank of magnetic flux ropes. So the 21 events may be magnetic flux\nropes but the \\emph{ACE} spacecraft passes through their flanks of magnetic\nflux ropes. Considering that most other non-MC events have disordered magnetic\nfields, we suggest that some non-MC ICMEs inherently have disordered magnetic\nfields, namely have no magnetic flux rope structures.\n",

By considering observers located at various positions in\nthe heliosphere, we investigate how drifts may alter the measured\nintensity-time profiles and energy spectra. We focus on the decay phase of\nsolar energetic proton events during which a temporal invariant spectrum and\ndisappearing spatial intensity gradients are often observed; a phenomenon known\nas the 'reservoir effect' or the 'SEP flood'. We study the effects of drifts by\nsolving the focused transport equation for nominal Parker solar wind\nconfigurations and for a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generated solar wind\ncontaining a corotating interaction region (CIR). The latter configuration\ncontains a magnetic bottle structure, with one bottleneck at the Sun and the\nother at the CIR. It is illustrated that observers magnetically connected close\nto the edges of the particle injection site can experience, as a result of\ndrifts, a sudden drop in the intensities occurring at different times for\ndifferent energies such that no SEP flood phenomenon is established. In the\nmagnetic bottle, this effect is enhanced due to the presence of magnetic field\ngradients strengthening the nominal particle drifts. We also show that\ninterplanetary cross-field diffusion may mitigate these effects of drifts. We\nconclude that particle drifts can in some cases substantially modify the decay\nphase of SEP events, especially if the solar wind contains compression regions\nor shock waves where the drifts are enhanced. This is, for example, the case\nfor our CIR solar wind configuration generated with a 3D MHD model, where the\neffect of drifts is strong. A similar decay rate in different energy channels\nand for different observers requires thus the mitigation of the effect of\ndrifts.\n",

Such bow waves or shocks\nwere recently observed to accelerate particles, thus contributing to\nmagnetosheath heating and particle acceleration in the extended environment of\nEarth bow shock. To further understand the characteristics of jet-driven bow\nwaves, we perform a statistical study to examine which solar wind conditions\nfavor their formation and whether it is common for them to accelerate\nparticles. We identified 364 out of 2859 (13%) magnetosheath jets to have a bow\nwave or shock ahead of them with Mach number typically larger than 1.1. We show\nthat large solar wind plasma beta, weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nstrength, large solar wind Alfven Mach number, and strong solar wind dynamic\npressure present favorable conditions for their formation. We also show that\nmagnetosheath jets with bow waves or shocks are more frequently associated with\nhigher maximum ion and electron energies than those without them, confirming\nthat it is common for these structures to accelerate particles. In particular,\nmagnetosheath jets with bow waves have electron energy flux enhanced on average\nby a factor of 2 compared to both those without bow waves and the ambient\nmagnetosheath.

The detailed internal distribution of twist is under debate mainly\nbecause the magnetic field (B) in MCs is observed only along the spacecraft\ntrajectory, and thus it is necessary to complete observations with theoretical\nassumptions. Estimating the twist from the study of a single event is difficult\nbecause the field fluctuations significantly increase the noise of the observed\nB time series and thus the bias of the deduced twist.

Classical signatures of the ion diffusion\nregion (IDR), including a sub-ion-Alfv\\'enic de-magnetized ion exhaust, a\nsuper-ion-Alfv\\'enic magnetized electron exhaust, and Hall electromagnetic\nfields, are identified. The opening angle between the magnetopause and\nmagnetospheric separatrix is $30^\\circ\\pm5^\\circ$. The exhaust preferentially\nexpands sunward, displacing the magnetosheath. Intense pileup of reconnected\nmagnetic flux occurs between the magnetosheath separatrix and the magnetopause\nin a narrow channel intermediate between the ion and electron scales. The\nstrength of the pileup (normalized values of 0.3-0.5) is consistent with the\nlarge angle at which the magnetopause is inclined relative to the overall\nreconnection coordinates. MMS-4, which was two ion inertial lengths closer to\nthe X-line than the other three spacecraft, observed intense electron-dominated\ncurrents and kinetic-to-electromagnetic-field energy conversion within the\npileup. MMS-1, 2, and 3 did not observe the intense currents nor the\nparticle-to-field energy conversion but did observe the pileup, indicating that\nthe edge of the generation region was contained within the tetrahedron.\nComparisons with particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the electron currents\nand large inclination angle of the magnetopause are interconnected features of\nthe asymmetric Hall effect. Between the separatrix and the magnetopause,\nhigh-density inflowing magnetosheath electrons brake and turn into the outflow\ndirection, imparting energy to the normal magnetic field and generating the\npileup. The findings indicate that electron dynamics are likely an important\ninfluence on the magnetic field structure within the ion diffusion region.\n",

In this\npaper, kinetic effects at proton scales in the nonlinear and turbulent stage of\nthe Kelvin-Helmholtz instability have been studied in magnetized collisionless\nplasmas by means of Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations. The main goal of this\nwork is to point out the back reaction on particles triggered by the evolution\nof such instability, as energy reaches kinetic scales along the turbulent\ncascade. Interestingly, turbulence is inhibited when Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability develops over an initial state which is not an exact equilibrium\nstate. On the other hand, when an initial equilibrium condition is considered,\nenergy can be efficiently transferred towards short scales, reaches the typical\nproton wavelengths and drives the dynamics of particles. As a consequence of\nthe interaction of particles with the turbulent fluctuating fields, the proton\nvelocity distribution deviates significantly from the local thermodynamic\nequilibrium, the degree of deviation increasing with the level of turbulence in\nthe system and being located near regions of strong magnetic stresses. These\nnumerical results support recent space observations from the Magnetospheric\nMultiScale mission of ion kinetic effects driven by the turbulent dynamics at\nthe Earth's magnetosheath (Perri et al., 2020, JPlPh, 86, 905860108) and by the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability in the Earth's magnetosphere (Sorriso-Valvo et\nal., 2019, PhRvL, 122, 035102).\n",

These signatures are bumps in the spectral\ndensity in the 10-200 Hz frequency range of the AC magnetic field as measured\nby the search coil magnetometer on board the Helios1 spacecraft. We show that\nthe majority of whistler signatures are observed in the slow solar wind (<500\nkm/s) and their occurrence increases with the radial distance (R), from ~3% at\n0.3 au to ~10% at 0.9 au. In the fast solar wind (>600 km/s), whistler activity\nis significantly lower; whistler signatures start to appear for R > 0.6 au and\ntheir number increases from ~0.03% at 0.65 au to ~1% at 0.9 au. We have studied\nthe variation of the electron core and halo anisotropy, as well as the electron\nnormalized heat flux as a function of R and of the solar wind speed. We find\nthat, in the slow wind electron core and halo anisotropy is higher than in fast\none, and also that these anisotropies increase radially in both types of winds,\nwhich is in line with the occurrence of whistler signatures. We hypothesize the\nexistence of a feedback mechanism to explain the observed radial variations of\nthe occurrence of whistlers in relation with the halo anisotropy.\n",

In the GLE event of 2000 July 14,\nobservations show that a very fast and strong magnetic cloud (MC) is behind the\nICME shock and the proton intensity-time profiles observed at 1 au had a rapid\ntwo-step decrease near the sheath and MC. Therefore, we study the effect of\nsheath and MC on SEPs accelerated by an ICME shock through numerically solving\nthe focused transport equation. The shock is regarded as a moving source of\nSEPs with an assumed particle distribution function. The sheath and MC are set\nto thick spherical caps with enhanced magnetic field, and the turbulence levels\nin sheath and MC are set to be higher and lower than that of the ambient solar\nwind, respectively. The simulation results of proton intensity-time profiles\nagree well with the observations in energies ranging from $\\sim$1 to $\\sim$100\nMeV, and the two-step decrease is reproduced when the sheath and MC arrived at\nthe Earth. The simulation results show that the sheath-MC structure reduced the\nproton intensities for about 2 days after shock passing through the Earth. It\nis found that the sheath contributed most of the decrease while the MC\nfacilitated the formation of the second step decrease. The simulation also\ninfers that the coordination of magnetic field and turbulence in sheath-MC\nstructure can produce a stronger effect of reducing SEP intensities.\n",

By analyzing the dispersion relation of fluctuating field\ncomponents directly issued from the shock simulation, we obtain key findings\nconcerning wave excitations at the shock front: (1) at the leading edge of the\nfoot, two types of electrostatic (ES) waves are observed. The relative drift of\nthe reflected ions versus the electrons triggers an electron cyclotron drift\ninstability (ECDI) which excites the first ES wave. Because the bulk velocity\nof gyro-reflected ions shifts to the direction of the shock front, the\nresulting ES wave propagates oblique to the shock normal. Immediately, a\nfraction of incident electrons are accelerated by this ES wave and a ring-like\nvelocity distribution is generated. They can couple with the hot Maxwellian\ncore and excite the second ES wave around the upper hybrid frequency. (2) from\nthe middle of the foot all the way to the ramp, electrons can couple with both\nincident and reflected ions. ES waves excited by ECDI in different directions\npropagate across each other. Electromagnetic (EM) waves (X mode) emitted toward\nupstream are observed in both regions. They are probably induced by a small\nfraction of relativistic electrons.

Our goal is to investigate how the negative VS correlates with\nelectron density and temperature and to understand the physics of the observed\ncorrelation. Methods. We applied full mission comparative statistics of VS,\nelectron temperature, and electron density to establish VS dependence on cold\nand warm plasma density and electron temperature. We also used\nSpacecraft-Plasma Interaction System (SPIS) simulations and an analytical\nvacuum model to investigate if positively biased elements covering a fraction\nof the solar array surface can explain the observed correlations. Results.\nHere, the VS was found to depend more on electron density, particularly with\nregard to the cold part of the electrons, and less on electron temperature than\nwas expected for the high flux of thermal (cometary) ionospheric electrons.\nThis behaviour was reproduced by an analytical model which is consistent with\nnumerical simulations. Conclusions. Rosetta is negatively driven mainly by\npositively biased elements on the borders of the front side of the solar panels\nas these can efficiently collect cold plasma electrons. Biased elements\ndistributed elsewhere on the front side of the panels are less efficient at\ncollecting electrons apart from locally produced electrons (photoelectrons).

Due to\ntheir dynamic pressure perturbations, they can disturb the bow shock and\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere system. They can also accelerate particles\ncontributing to shock acceleration. However, it is still unclear how exactly\nthey form. Recent particle-in-cell simulations point out the important role of\nelectric field and Hall current in the formation process. To further examine\nthis, we use data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to apply\ncase studies on two small (1000-2000 km) foreshock transient events that just\nstarted to form. In event 1 where MMS were in a tetrahedral formation, we show\nthat the current density configuration, which determined the magnetic field\nprofile, was mainly driven by Hall currents generated by demagnetized foreshock\nions. The resulting time variation of the magnetic field induced electric field\nthat drove cold plasma moving outward with magnetic field lines. In event 2\nwhere MMS were in a string-of-pearls formation, we analyze the evolution of\nfield and plasma parameters. We show that the magnetic flux and mass flux were\ntransported outward from the core resulting in the steepening of the boundary.\nThe steepened boundary, which trapped more foreshock ions and caused stronger\ndemagnetization of foreshock ions, nonlinearly further enhanced the Hall\ncurrent. Based on our observations, we propose a physical formation process\nthat the positive feedback of foreshock ions on the varying magnetic field\ncaused by the foreshock ion Hall current enables an instability and the growth\nof the structure.\n",

In particular we focus on the properties of the\nmagnetic field and its component anisotropy in Cluster measurements and hybrid\n2D simulations. First, we address the angular distribution of wave-vectors in\nthe kinetic range between ion and electron scales by studying the variance\nanisotropy of the magnetic field components. When taking into account the\nsingle-direction sampling performed by spacecraft in the solar wind, the main\nproperties of the fluctuations observed in situ are also recovered in our\nnumerical description. This result confirms that solar wind turbulence in the\nsub-ion range is characterized by a quasi-2D gyrotropic distribution of\nk-vectors around the mean field. We then consider the magnetic compressibility\nassociated with the turbulent cascade and its evolution from large-MHD to\nsub-ion scales. The ratio of field-aligned to perpendicular fluctuations,\ntypically low in the MHD inertial range, increases significantly when crossing\nion scales and its value in the sub-ion range is a function of the total plasma\nbeta only, as expected from theoretical predictions, with higher magnetic\ncompressibility for higher beta. Moreover, we observe that this increase has a\ngradual trend from low to high beta values in the in situ data; this behaviour\nis well captured by the numerical simulations. The level of magnetic field\ncompressibility that is observed in situ and in the simulations is in fairly\ngood agreement with theoretical predictions, especially at high beta,\nsuggesting that in the kinetic range explored the turbulence is supported by\nlow-frequency and highly-oblique fluctuations in pressure balance, like kinetic\nAlfv\\'en waves or other slowly evolving coherent structures.\n",

A\nparameterized model for the altitude dependence of the Alfv\\'en wave electric\nfield, constrained by CHAMP data, has been developed and embedded in the Joule\nheating module of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Coupled\nMagnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere (CMIT) model. The CMIT model was then\nused to simulate the geospace response to an interplanetary stream interaction\nregion (SIR) that swept past Earth on 26-27 March 2003. CMIT diagnostics for\nthe thermospheric mass density at 400 km altitude show: 1) CMIT without\nAlfv\\'enic Joule heating usually underestimates CHAMP's orbit-average density;\ninclusion of Alfv\\'enic heating modestly improves CMIT's orbit-average\nprediction of the density (by a few %), especially during the more active\nperiods of the SIR event. 2) The improvement in CMIT's instantaneous density\nprediction with Alfv\\'enic heating included is more significant (up to 15%) in\nthe vicinity of the cusp heating region, a feature that the MSIS empirical\nthermosphere model misses for this event. Thermospheric density changes of\n20-30% caused by the cusp-region Alfv\\'enic heating sporadically populate the\npolar region through the action of corotation and neutral winds.\n",

Here we show that superimposed on this smooth\nsignal is an irregular pattern of small perturbations, which are anticorrelated\nwith the plasma density measured by the Langmuir probe. We show that the\nperturbations can be remarkably well reproduced by assuming they represent a j\nx B force, which balances the plasma pressure gradient implied by the density\nvariations.

About 150 pulsating auroral events over the\nFennoscandian Lapland have been successfully analyzed for their average patch\nsize, total patch area, and number of patches as a function of event time,\ntypically 1-2 hr. An automatic routine has been developed to detect patches in\nthe all-sky camera images. In addition to events with decreasing and increasing\naverage patch size evolution over the course of the pulsating aurora, events\nwith no size trends and events with intermittently increasing and decreasing\npatch size trends were also found. In this study, we have analyzed a subset of\nevents for which the average and total patch size systematically increase or\ndecrease. The events with increasing patch size trend do not experience a\ndecrease in the peak emission height, which was previously associated with the\nbehavior of pulsating aurora precipitation. Furthermore, the events with\nincreasing patch sizes have shorter lifetimes and twice as many\nsubstorm-injected energetic electrons at geosynchronous orbit as the events\nwith decreasing patch sizes. Half of the events with increasing patch sizes\noccur during substorm expansion phases, while a majority (64%) of the ones with\ndecreasing patch sizes take place during the recovery phase.

We find that the energy supply rate is consistent with the observed\nperpendicular heating rate calculated based on the gradient of the magnetic\nmoment. Based on this finding, one could explain why the slow solar wind is\nstrongly heated inside 0.25 au but expands nearly adiabatically outside 0.25\nau. This finding supports the concept that the energy added from the\nenergy-containing range is transferred by an energy cascade process to the\ndissipation range, and then dissipates to heat the slow solar wind.

In\nthis study, we investigate for the first time the radiation belt response to an\nFRS impact using multi-satellite observations and numerical simulations.\nSpacecraft on the dayside observed decreases in magnetic field strength and\nenergetic (~ 40-475 keV) particle fluxes.

Particles with different energies vary simultaneously at each\nspacecraft, implying a non-dispersive particle response to the shock.\nSpacecraft located at lower L-shells did not record any significant signatures.\nThe observations indicate a local time dependence of the response associated\nwith the shock inclination, with the clearest signatures being observed in the\ndusk-midnight sector. Simulations underestimate the amplitude of the magnetic\nfield variations observed on the nightside. The observed decreases in the\nelectron intensities result from a combination of radial gradient and adiabatic\neffects. The radial gradients in the spectral index appear to be the dominant\ncontributor to the observed variations of electrons seen on the dayside (near\nnoon and dusk) and on the nightside (near midnight).

The model is based on the assumption that the ambient solar\nwind interacts with the interplanetary CME (ICME) resulting in constant\nacceleration or deceleration. The upgraded version of the model (EAMv3),\npresented here, incorporates two basic improvements: (a) a new technique for\nthe calculation of the acceleration (or deceleration) of the ICME from the Sun\nto 1 AU and (b) a correction for the CME plane-of-sky speed. A validation of\nthe upgraded EAM model is performed via comparisons to predictions from the\nensemble version of the Drag-Based model (DBEM) and the WSA-ENLIL+Cone ensemble\nmodel. A common sample of 16 CMEs/ICMEs, in 2013-2014, is used for the\ncomparison. Basic performance metrics such as the mean absolute error (MAE),\nmean error (ME) and root mean squared error (RMSE) between observed and\npredicted values of ToA are presented.

        "summary": "  The Satellite for Orbital Aerodynamics Research (SOAR) is a CubeSat mission,\ndue to be launched in 2021, to investigate the interaction between different\nmaterials and the atmospheric flow regime in very low Earth orbits (VLEO).\nImproving knowledge of the gas-surface interactions at these altitudes and\nidentification of novel materials that can minimise drag or improve aerodynamic\ncontrol are important for the design of future spacecraft that can operate in\nlower altitude orbits. Such satellites may be smaller and cheaper to develop or\ncan provide improved Earth observation data or communications link-budgets and\nlatency. Using precise orbit and attitude determination information and the\nmeasured atmospheric flow characteristics the forces and torques experienced by\nthe satellite in orbit can be studied and estimates of the aerodynamic\ncoefficients calculated. This paper presents the scientific concept and design\nof the SOAR mission. The methodology for recovery of the aerodynamic\ncoefficients from the measured orbit, attitude, and in-situ atmospheric data\nusing a least-squares orbit determination and free-parameter fitting process is\ndescribed and the experimental uncertainty of the resolved aerodynamic\ncoefficients is estimated. The presented results indicate that the combination\nof the satellite design and experimental methodology are capable of clearly\nillustrating the variation of drag and lift coefficient for differing surface\nincidence angle. The lowest uncertainties for the drag coefficient measurement\nare found at approximately 300 km, whilst the measurement of lift coefficient\nimproves for reducing orbital altitude to 200 km.\n",

        "summary": "  This observational study demonstrates that the magnitude and location of\nenergization of electrons in the Martian magnetosheath is more complex than\nprevious studies suggest. Electrons in Mars's magnetosheath originate in the\nsolar wind and are accelerated by an electric field when they cross the bow\nshock. Assuming that this acceleration is localized solely to the shock, the\nfield-aligned electron distributions in the sheath are expected to be highly\nasymmetric. However, such an asymmetry is not observed in this study. Based on\nthe analysis here, it is suggested that an additional parallel acceleration\ntakes place downstream of the Martian bow shock. This additional acceleration\nsuppresses the expected asymmetry of the electron distribution. Consequently,\nalong a flux tube in the magnetosheath that is tied on both ends to the bow\nshock the difference in energization between parallel and anti-parallel\nelectrons is less than about 20 eV. Where this energization difference is\nexpected to be maximal, we find the energization difference to be at most 25%\nof the predicted value.\n",

Ultra-relativistic electrons with energies greater than or\nequal to two Megaelectron-volt (MeV) are of particular interest due to their\nhigh penetrating ability, and thus forecasting these >=2 MeV electron levels\nhas significant meaning to all space sectors. Here we update the latest\ndevelopment of the predictive model for MeV electrons inside the Earth's outer\nradiation belt. The new version, called PreMevE-2E, focuses on forecasting\nultra-relativistic electron flux distributions across the outer radiation belt,\nwith no need of in-situ measurements except for at the geosynchronous (GEO)\norbit. Model inputs include precipitating electrons observed in\nlow-Earth-orbits by NOAA satellites, upstream solar wind conditions (speeds and\ndensities) from solar wind monitors, as well as ultra-relativistic electrons\nmeasured by one Los Alamos GEO satellite. We evaluated a total of 32 supervised\nmachine learning models that fall into four different classes of linear and\nneural network architectures, and also successfully tested ensemble forecasting\nby using groups of top-performing models. All models are individually trained,\nvalidated, and tested by in-situ electron data from NASA's Van Allen Probes\nmission. It is shown that the final ensemble model generally outperforms\nindividual models overs L-shells, and this PreMevE-2E model provides reliable\nand high-fidelity 25-hr (~1-day) and 50-hr (~2-day) forecasts with high mean\nperformance efficiency values. Our results also suggest this new model is\ndominated by non-linear components at low L-shells (< ~4) for\nultra-relativistic electrons, which is different from the dominance of linear\ncomponents at all L-shells for 1 MeV electrons as previously discovered.\n",

The study shows that the dust population studied\npresents a radial velocity component directed outward from the Sun, the order\nof magnitude of which can be roughly estimated as $v_{r, dust} \\simeq 50$\nkm.$s^{-1}$. This is consistent with the flux of impactors being dominated by\n$\\beta$-meteoroids.

It enables us to, for example, compute wavelengths, wave potentials,\nand determine the energy of resonant particles. The phase velocity of a wave,\nobserved by a single spacecraft equipped with electric field probes, can be\ndetermined using interferometry techniques. While several methods have been\ndeveloped to do this, they have not been documented in detail. In this study,\nwe use an analytical model to analyze and compare three interferometry methods\napplied on the probe geometry of the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. One\nmethod relies on measured probe potentials, whereas the other two use different\nE-field measurements: one by reconstructing the E-field between two probes and\nthe spacecraft, the other by constructing four pairwise parallel E-field\ncomponents in the spacecraft spin-plane. We find that the potential method is\nsensitive both to how planar the wave is, and to spacecraft potential changes\ndue to the wave. The E-field methods are less affected by the spacecraft\npotential, and while the reconstructed E-field method is applicable in some\ncases, the second E-field method is almost always preferable. We conclude that\nthe potential based interferometry method is useful when spacecraft potential\neffects are negligible and the signals of the different probes are very well\ncorrelated. The method using two pairs of parallel E-fields is practically\nalways preferable to the reconstructed E-field method and produces the correct\nvelocity in the spin-plane, but it requires knowledge of the propagation\ndirection to provide the full velocity.\n",

Fast and slow electrons are defined as having kinetic energies\nafter photoemission above and below the maximum allowable potential above\nground, VTMmax, required for normal operation of the TM. In their optimized\nconfigurations and following a 10 to 30 sec exposure to UV with initial TM\npotentials of between -3 V and 3 V, both control systems converge to a TM\npotential of about 10 mV with a drift of about 2 mV/day. For reference, VTMmax\nis about 100mV for the LISA and LISA pathfinder sensors. Insight into the slow\nphotoelectrons charge control method is provided by our simple gaussian model\nof the distribution of the photoemission sites of Au films: 4.6 eV center, 0.2\neV standard deviation, and 4.30 eV and 4.90 eV cutoffs. The lowest energy\nphotoemission is obtained with the 295 nm LED at about 4.35 eV or 285 nm;\nequivalent to 2.5 times the standard deviation from its center wavelength and\nat 4% of its maximum intensity.\n",

We derive a gyro-averaged kinetic transport\nequation that accounts for the spherical expansion of the solar wind and the\ngeometry of the Parker-spiral magnetic field. To solve our three-dimensional\nkinetic equation, we develop a mathematical approach that combines the\nCrank--Nicolson scheme in velocity space and a finite-difference Euler scheme\nin configuration space. We initialize our model with isotropic electron\ndistribution functions and calculate the kinetic expansion at heliocentric\ndistances from 5 to 20 solar radii. In our kinetic model, the electrons evolve\nmainly through the combination of the ballistic particle streaming, the\nmagnetic mirror force, and the electric field. By applying fits to our\nnumerical results, we quantify the parameters of the electron strahl and core\npart of the electron velocity distributions. The strahl fit parameters show\nthat the density of the electron strahl is around 7% of the total electron\ndensity at a distance of 20 solar radii, the strahl bulk velocity and strahl\ntemperature parallel to the background magnetic field stay approximately\nconstant beyond a distance of 15 solar radii, and $\\beta_{\\parallel s}$ (i.e.,\nthe ratio between strahl parallel thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure) is\napproximately constant with heliocentric distance at a value of about 0.02. We\ncompare our results with data measured by Parker Solar Probe. Furthermore, we\nprovide theoretical evidence that the electron strahl is not scattered by the\noblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability in the near-Sun environment.\n",

Non-contact\ncharge management systems are required for the most sensitive of these\ninstruments, with the TMs free-floating, and their charges compensated by\nphotoelectrons in a feedback loop with a TM charge measurement. Three space\nmissions have successfully demonstrated this technique: GP-B, LPF, and the\nUV-LED mission. Charge management techniques that eliminate the charge\nmeasurement and feedback systems, referred henceforth as passive, reduce the\ncomplexities and disturbance effects introduced by these systems, and are thus\nthe subject of active research and development work. Passive charge management\ndepends critically on the stability and reproducibility of the photoemission\nproperties of a given system. In support of this work, we present comprehensive\nflight characterization data for a suite of 16 UV-LEDs in various\nconfigurations and 255+/-1 nm center wavelength. Flight data was acquired\nbetween December 2014 and December 2015 with the UV-LED instrument flown on\nSaudiSat 4.

All results confirm the excellent reliability of the UV-LEDs\nin the space environment, are fully consistent with the findings of ground\nstudies, and support the approach of using LEDs for passive charge management.\nWe find that the equilibrium potential of the TM, under illumination by the 255\nnm LEDs, is independent of the UV intensity and reproduceable to about +/- 6\nmV, or +/-6 fC/pF, over periods of up to six months. The value of the\nequilibrium potential is dependent on the geometry of the electric field\nbetween the TM and its enclosure, and thus on the exact configuration of the\ninstrument.\n",

However, recent in-situ\nobservations have revealed the presence of protons in the near-lunar wake (100\nkm to 200 km from the surface). The solar wind, either directly or after\ninteraction with the lunar surface (including magnetic anomalies), is the\nsource of these protons in the near-wake region. Using the entire data from the\nSWIM sensor of the SARA experiment onboard Chandrayaan-1, we analysed the\nvelocity distribution of the protons observed in the near-lunar wake. The\naverage velocity distribution functions, computed in the solar wind rest frame,\nwere further separated based on the angle between the upstream solar wind\nvelocity and the IMF. Several proton populations were identified from the\nvelocity distribution and their possible entry mechanism were inferred based on\nthe characteristics of the velocity distribution. These entry mechanisms\ninclude (i) diffusion of solar wind protons into the wake along IMF, (ii) the\nsolar wind protons with finite gyro-radii that are aided by the wake boundary\nelectric field, (iii) solar wind protons with gyro-radii larger than lunar\nradii from the tail of the solar wind velocity distribution, and (iv)\nscattering of solar wind protons from the dayside lunar surface or from\nmagnetic anomalies. In order to gain more insight into the entry mechanisms\nassociated with different populations, backtracing is carried out for each of\nthese populations. For most of the populations, the source of the protons\nobtained from backtracing is found to be in agreement with that inferred from\nthe velocity distribution.

This study investigates the global auroral response in both\nhemispheres when the IMF is southward and lies in the $\\textit{xz}$ plane. We\npresent a statistical study of the average auroral response in the 12-24\nmagnetic local time (MLT) sector to an $\\textit{x}$ component in the IMF. Maps\nof auroral intensity in both hemispheres for two IMF $\\mathit{B}_{x}$ dominated\nconditions($ \\pm $ IMF $\\mathit{B}_{x}$) are shown during periods of negative\nIMF $\\mathit{B}_{z}$, small IMF $\\mathit{B}_{y}$, and local winter. This is\nobtained by using global imaging from the Wideband Imaging Camera on the IMAGE\nsatellite. The analysis indicates a significant asymmetry between the two IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{x}$ dominated conditions in both hemispheres. In the Northern\nHemisphere the aurora is brighter in the 15-19 MLT region during negative IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{x}$. In the Southern Hemisphere the aurora is brighter in the\n16-20 MLT sector during positive IMF $\\mathit{B}_{x}$. We interpret the results\nin the context of a more efficient solar wind dynamo in one hemisphere. Both\nthe intensity asymmetry and its location are consistent with this idea. This\nhas earlier been suggested from case studies of simultaneous observations of\nthe aurora in both hemispheres, but hitherto never been observed to have a\ngeneral impact on global auroral brightness in both hemispheres from a\nstatistical study. The observed asymmetries between the two IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{x}$ cases are not large; however, the difference is significant\nwith a 95% confidence level. As the solar wind conditions examined in the study\nare rather common (37% of the time) the accumulative effect of this small\ninfluence may be important for the total energy budget.\n",

The reported results are based on a large number of measurements\nobtained by the Cluster satellites during magnetopause traversals. Using a\ncombination of single-spacecraft and multispacecraft techniques, we calculated\nmacroscopic features such as thickness, location, and motion of the\nmagnetopause. The results show that the typical flank magnetopause is\nsignificantly thicker than the dayside magnetopause and also possesses a\npronounced and persistent dawn-dusk asymmetry. Thicknesses vary from 150 to\n5000 km, with an median thickness of around 1400 km at dawn and around 1150 km\nat dusk. Current densities are on average higher on dusk, suggesting that the\ntotal current at dawn and dusk are similar. Solar wind conditions and the\ninterplanetary magnetic field cannot fully explain the observed dawn-dusk\nasymmetry. For a number of crossings we were also able to derive detailed\ncurrent density profiles. The profiles show that the magnetopause often\nconsists of two or more adjacent current sheets, each current sheet typically\nseveral ion gyroradii thick and often with different current direction. This\ndemonstrates that the flank magnetopause has a structure that is more complex\nthan the thin, one-dimensional current sheet described by a Chapman-Ferraro\nlayer.\n",

The $\\textit{AL}$ and the\nrecently introduced $\\textit{SML}$ index are frequently used as monitors of the\nwestward electrojet. Both indices are based on ground magnetometers at auroral\nlatitudes. From these magnetometers, the largest perturbation in the southward\ndirection is selected as the $\\textit{ AL/SML }$ index at 1 min cadence. The\nsouthward component is defined as antiparallel to the orientation of the\nhorizontal part of the Earths' main field, $\\textbf{B}_{0, \\textit{H}}$. The\nimplicit assumption when using these indices as a monitor of the westward\nelectrojet is that the electrojet flows perpendicular to $\\textbf{B}_{0,\n\\textit{H}}$. However, $\\textbf{B}_{0, \\textit{H}}$ is, in general, not\nperpendicular to the westward direction in coordinate systems that take\nnondipole terms of the Earth's magnetic field into account, such as apex and\nthe Altitude Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic coordinate systems. In this paper\nwe derive a new $\\textit{SML}$ index, based on apex coordinates. We find that\nthe new index has less variation with longitude and universal time (UT),\ncompared to the traditionally defined $\\textit{SML}$. We argue that when\nanalyzing ionospheric currents using magnetometers, it is appropriate to\nconvert the components to a corrected geomagnetic system. This is most\nimportant when considering longitudinal or UT variations, or when data from a\nlimited region are used.\n",

The intense auroral emissions were colocated\nwith polar cap patches (blobs). The patches did not contain strong\nirregularities, neither before entering the auroral oval nor after the aurora\nhad faded.

(1) The DDAs can be classified\ninto two broad categories, i.e., unstructured and structured DDAs. The\nunstructured DDAs are mainly distributed in the morning and afternoon, but the\nstructured DDAs predominantly occurred around the magnetic local noon (MLN).\n(2) The unstructured DDAs observed in morning and afternoon present obviously\ndifferent properties. The afternoon ones are much stable and seldom show\npulsating property. (3) The DDAs are more easily observed under geomagnetically\nquiet times. (4) The structured DDAsmainly show patchy, stripy, and irregular\nforms and are often pulsating and drifting. The drifting directions are mostly\nwestward (with speed $\\sim$5km/s), but there are cases showing eastward or\npoleward drifting. (5) The stripy DDAs are exclusively observed near theMLN\nand,most importantly, their alignments are confirmed to be consistent with the\ndirection of ionospheric convection near the MLN.

A survey is\nmade of 221 near-limb filament eruptions observed from 2013/05/03-2014/06/30 by\nEUV imagers and coronagraphs. 92 filament eruptions are associated with 3-part\nstructured CMEs, 41 eruptions are associated with unstructured CMEs.

For 34% of the 3-part CMEs,\nprocessing applied to EUV images reveals the erupting front edge is a\npre-existing loop structure surrounding the filament, which subsequently erupts\nwith the filament to form the leading bright front edge of the CME. This\nconnection is confirmed by a flux-rope density model. Furthermore, the\nunstructured CMEs have a narrower distribution of mass compared to structured\nCMEs, with total mass comparable to the mass of 3-part CME cores. This study\nsupports the interpretation of 3-part CME leading fronts as the outer\nboundaries of a large pre-existing flux tube. Unstructured (non 3-part) CMEs\nare a different family to structured CMEs, arising from the eruption of\nfilaments which are compact flux tubes in the absence of a large system of\nenclosing closed field.\n",

However, SAFs are rarely observed at 1 au and\nsolar wind AFs are found to be generally outward. Using the measurements from\nVoyager 2 and Wind, we perform a statistical survey of SAFs in the heliosphere\ninside 6 au. We first report two SAF events observed by Voyager 2. One is in\nthe anti-sunward magnetic sector with a strong positive correlation between the\nfluctuations of magnetic field and solar wind velocity. The other one is in the\nsunward magnetic sector with a strong negative magnetic field-velocity\ncorrelation. Statistically, the percentage of SAFs increases gradually with\nheliocentric distance, from about 2.7% at 1.0 au to about 8.7% at 5.5 au. These\nresults provide new clues for understanding the generation mechanism of SAFs.\n",

This is interpreted as evidence of closed field lines having very\nasymmetric footpoints associated with the persistent positive $\\textit{y}$\ncomponent of the interplanetary magnetic field before and during the event. At\nthe same time, the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network observes the ionospheric\nnightside convection throat region in both hemispheres. The radar data indicate\nfaster convection toward the dayside in the dusk cell in the Southern\nHemisphere compared to its conjugate region. We interpret this as a signature\nof a process acting to restore symmetry of the displaced closed magnetic field\nlines resulting in flux tubes moving faster along the banana cell than the\nconjugate orange cell. The event is analyzed with emphasis on Birkeland\ncurrents (BC) associated with this restoring process, as recently described by\nTenfjord et al. (2015). Using data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary\nElectrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) during the same conditions as the\npresented event, the large-scale BC pattern associated with the event is\npresented. It shows the expected influence of the process of restoring symmetry\non BCs. We therefore suggest that these observations should be recognized as\nbeing a result of the dynamic effects of restoring footpoint symmetry on closed\nfield lines in the nightside.\n",

The Medium\nEnergy Proton and Electron Detectors (MEPED) instrument on board the NOAA/Polar\nOrbiting Environmental Satellites(POES) and MetOp spacecraft has two sets of\nelectron and proton telescopes pointing close to zenith ($0 ^{\\circ}$) and in\nthe horizontal plane ($90 ^{\\circ}$). Using measurements from either the $0\n^{\\circ}$ or $90 ^{\\circ}$ telescope will underestimate or overestimate the\nbounce loss cone flux, respectively, as the energetic electron fluxes are often\nstrongly anisotropic with decreasing fluxes toward the center of the loss cone.\nBy combining the measurements from both telescopes with electron pitch angle\ndistributions from theory of wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere, a\ncomplete bounce loss cone flux is constructed for each of the electron energy\nchannels >50 keV, >100 keV, and >300 keV. We apply a correction method to\nremove proton contamination in the electron counts. We also account for the\nrelativistic (>1000 keV) electrons contaminating the proton detector at\nsubauroral latitudes. This gives us full range coverage of electron energies\nthat will be deposited in the middle atmosphere. Finally, we demonstrate the\nmethod's applicability on strongly anisotropic pitch angle distributions during\na weak geomagnetic storm in February 2008. We compare the electron fluxes and\nsubsequent energy deposition estimates to OH observations from the Microwave\nLimb Sounder on the Aura satellite substantiating that the estimated fluxes are\nrepresentative for the true precipitating fluxes impacting the atmosphere.\n",

A diurnal variation is\nidentified in the total Birkeland current flowing, consistent with variations\nin the solar zenith angle.

We also\nconduct the first test of the Milan (2013) model for estimating Birkeland\ncurrent magnitudes, with modifications made to account for solar contributions\nto ionospheric conductance based on the observed variation of the Birkeland\ncurrents with season and time of day.

By comparing monthly mean\naccumulated integral flux from a new and an old satellite at the same magnetic\nlocal time (MLT) and time period, we estimate the change in energy thresholds.\nThe first 12 monthly energy spectra of the new satellite are used as a\nreference, and the derived monthly correction factors over a year for an old\nsatellite show a small spread, indicating a robust calibration procedure. The\nmethod enables us to determine for the first time the correction factors also\nfor the highest-energy channels of the proton detector. In addition, we make\nuse of the newest satellite in orbit (MetOp-01) to find correction factors for\n2013 for the NOAA 17 and MetOp-02 satellites. Without taking into account the\nlevel of degradation, the proton data from one satellite cannot be used\nquantitatively for more than 2 to 3 years after launch. As the electron\ndetectors are vulnerable to contamination from energetic protons, the corrected\nproton measurements will be of value for electron flux measurements too. Thus,\nthe correction factors ensure the correctness of both the proton and electron\nmeasurements.\n",

A number of current systems exist in the magnetosphere,\nmost commonly defined as (1) the dayside magnetopause Chapman-Ferraro currents,\n(2) the Birkeland field-aligned currents with high latitude \"region 1\" and\nlower-latitude \"region 2\" currents connected to the partial ring current, (3)\nthe magnetotail currents, and (4) the symmetric ring current. In the near-Earth\nnightside region, however, several of these current systems flow in close\nproximity to each other. Moreover, the existence of other temporal current\nsystems, such as the substorm current wedge or \"banana\" current, has been\nreported. It is very difficult to identify a local measurement as belonging to\na specific system. Such identification is important, however, because how the\ncurrent closes and how these loops change in space and time governs the\nmagnetic topology of the magnetosphere and therefore controls the physical\nprocesses of geospace. Furthermore, many methods exist for identifying the\nregions of near-Earth space carrying each type of current. This study presents\na robust collection of these definitions of current systems in geospace,\nparticularly in the near-Earth nightside magnetosphere, as viewed from a\nvariety of observational and computational analysis techniques.

        "summary": "  Gravity assist manoeuvres are one of the most succesful techniques in\nastrodynamics. In these trajectories the spacecraft comes very close to the\nsurface of the Earth, or other Solar system planets or moons, and, as a\nconsequence, it experiences the effect of atmospheric friction by the outer\nlayers of the Earth's atmosphere or ionosphere.\n  In this paper we analyze a standard atmospheric model to estimate the density\nprofile during the two Galileo flybys, the NEAR and the Juno flyby. We show\nthat, even allowing for a margin of uncertainty in the spacecraft cross-section\nand the drag coefficient, the observed -8 mm/sec anomalous velocity decrease\nduring the second Galileo flyby of December, 8th, 1992 cannot be attributed\nonly to atmospheric friction. On the other hand, for perigees on the border\nbetween the termosphere and the exosphere the friction only accounts for a\nfraction of a millimeter per second in the final asymptotic velocity.\n",

The accuracy of TLE propagations through the Simplified General\nPerturbations-4 (SGP4) software decreases dramatically as the propagation\nhorizon increases, and thus the period of validity of TLEs is very limited. As\na result, TLEs are gradually becoming insufficient for the growing demands of\nSpace Situational Awareness (SSA). We propose a technique, based on the hybrid\npropagation methodology, aimed at extending TLE validity with minimal changes\nto the current TLE-SGP4 system in a non-intrusive way. It requires that the\ninstitution in possession of the osculating elements distributes hybrid TLEs,\nHTLEs, which encapsulate the standard TLE and the model of its propagation\nerror. The validity extension can be accomplished when the end user processes\nHTLEs through the hybrid SGP4 propagator, HSGP4, which comprises the standard\nSGP4 and an error corrector.\n",

They are known to play a role in electron\nthermodynamics/acceleration and, under certain conditions, are markedly\nobserved as wave trains preceding the shock ramp. In this paper, we take\nadvantage of Cassini's presence at ~10 AU to explore the importance of\nwhistler-mode waves in a parameter regime typically characterized by higher\nMach number (median of ~14) shocks, as well as a significantly different IMF\nstructure, compared to near Earth. We identify electromagnetic precursors\npreceding a small subset of bow shock crossings with properties which are\nconsistent with whistler-mode waves. We find these monochromatic,\nlow-frequency, circularly-polarized waves to have a typical frequency range of\n0.2 - 0.4 Hz in the spacecraft frame. This is due to the lower ion and electron\ncyclotron frequencies near Saturn, between which whistler waves can develop.\nThe waves are also observed as predominantly right-handed in the spacecraft\nframe, the opposite sense to what is typically observed near Earth. This is\nattributed to the weaker Doppler shift, owing to the large angle between the\nsolar wind velocity and magnetic field vectors at 10 AU. Our results on the low\noccurrence of whistler waves upstream of Saturn also underpins the\npredominantly supercritical bow shock of Saturn.\n",

SYMH and ASYH indices represent longitudinal\nsymmetric and asymmetric component of the ring current. Here, an attempt is\nmade to develop a prediction model for these indices using ANN. The ring\ncurrent state depends on its past conditions therefore, it is necessary to\nconsider its history for prediction. To account this effect Nonlinear\nAutoregressive Network with eXogenous inputs (NARX) is implemented. This\nnetwork considers input history of 30 minutes and output feedback of 120\nminutes. Solar wind parameters mainly velocity, density and interplanetary\nmagnetic field are used as inputs. SYMH and ASYH indices during geomagnetic\nstorms of 1998-2013, having minimum SYMH <-85 nT are used as the target for\ntraining two independent networks. We present the prediction of SYMH and ASYH\nindices during 9 geomagnetic storms of solar cycle 24 including the recent\nlargest storm occurred on St. Patrick's day, 2015. The present prediction model\nreproduces the entire time profile of SYMH and ASYH indices along with small\nvariations of ~ 10-30 minutes to good extent within noise level, indicating\nsignificant contribution of interplanetary sources and past state of the\nmagnetosphere. Therefore, the developed networks can predict SYMH and ASYH\nindices about an hour before, provided, real-time upstream solar wind data is\navailable. However, during the main phase of major storms, residuals\n(observed-modeled) are found to be large, suggesting influence of internal\nfactors such as magnetospheric processes\n",

This paper compares this new V1 data\nwith data from the earth-orbiting PAMELA experiment up to energies greater than\n10 GeV where solar modulation effects are negligible. In this energy regime we\nassume the main parameters governing electron propagation are diffusion and\nenergy loss and we use a Monte Carlo program to describe this propagation in\nthe galaxy. To reproduce the new Voyager electron spectrum, which is E-1.3,\ntogether with that measured by PAMELA which is E-3.20 above 10 GeV, we require\na diffusion coefficient which is P 0.45 at energies above 0.5 GeV changing to a\nP-1.00 dependence at lower rigidities. The entire electron spectrum observed at\nboth V1 and PAMELA from 3 MeV to 30 GeV can then be described by a simple\nsource spectrum, dj/dP P-2.25, with a spectral exponent that is independent of\nrigidity. The change in exponent of the measured electron spectrum from -1.3 at\nlow energies to 3.2 at the highest energies can be explained by galactic\npropagation effects related to the changing dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient below 0.5 GeV, and the increasing importance above 0.5 GV of energy\nloss from synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, which are both E2, and\nwhich are responsible for most of the changing spectral exponent above 1.0 GV.\n  As a result of the P-1.00 dependence of the diffusion coefficient below 0.5\nGV that is required to fit the V1 electron spectrum, there is a rapid flow of\nthese low energy electrons out of the galaxy. These electrons in local IG space\nare unobservable to us at any wave length and therefore form a dark energy\ncomponent which is 100 times the electrons rest energy.\n",

The four categories are the ones previously adopted in Xu\n& Borovsky [2015]: ejecta, coronal hole origin plasma, streamer belt origin\nplasma, and sector reversal origin plasma. The algorithm is trained and tested\non a labeled portion of the OMNI dataset. It uses seven inputs: the solar wind\nspeed $V_{sw}$, the temperature standard deviation $\\sigma_T$, the sunspot\nnumber $R$, the $f_{10.7}$ index, the Alfven speed $v_A$, the proton specific\nentropy $S_p$ and the proton temperature $T_p$ compared to a velocity-dependent\nexpected temperature. The output of the Gaussian Process classifier is a four\nelement vector containing the probabilities that an event (one reading from the\nhourly-averaged OMNI database) belongs to each category. The probabilistic\nnature of the prediction allows for a more informative and flexible\ninterpretation of the results, for instance being able to classify events as\n'undecided'. The new method has a median accuracy larger than $90\\%$ for all\ncategories, even using a small set of data for training. The Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic curve and the reliability diagram also demonstrate the excellent\nquality of this new method. Finally, we use the algorithm to classify a large\nportion of the OMNI dataset, and we present for the first time transition\nprobabilities between different solar wind categories.

By ~20 AU, the pickup ions already provide the dominant internal\npressure in the solar wind. We determine the radial trends and extrapolate them\nto the termination shock at ~90 AU, where the pickup H+ to core solar wind\ndensity reaches ~0.14. The pickup H+ temperature and thermal pressure increase\nfrom 22-38 AU, indicating additional heating of the pickup ions. This produces\nvery large extrapolated ratios of pickup H+ to solar wind temperature and\npressure and an extrapolated ratio of the pickup ion pressure to the solar wind\ndynamic pressure at the termination shock of ~0.16. Such a large ratio has\nprofound implications for moderating the termination shock and the overall\nouter heliospheric interaction. We also identify suprathermal tails in the H+\nspectra and complex features in the He+ spectra, likely indicating variations\nin the pickup ion history and processing.

The\nresults from this set of omega band events agree remarkably well with previous\nobservations of omega band occurrence in magnetic local time (MLT), lifetime,\nlocation between the region 1 and 2 field-aligned currents, as well as current\ndensity estimates. The average peak emission height of omega forms corresponds\nto the estimated precipitation energies of a few keV, which experienced no\nsignificant change during the events. Analysis of both local and global\nmagnetic indices demonstrates that omega bands are observed during substorm\nexpansion and recovery phases that are more intense than average substorm\nexpansion and recovery phases in the same region. The omega occurrence with\nrespect to the substorm expansion and recovery phases is in a very good\nagreement with an earlier observed distribution of fast earthward flows in the\nplasma sheet during expansion and recovery phases.

Some of this Z dependence can be explained by the Z2\ndependence of energy loss by ionization in the 7-10 g/cm2 of interstellar H and\nHe traversed by cosmic rays of these energies in the galaxy; some by the Z\ndependent loss due to nuclear interactions in this same material; some by\npossible differences in the source spectra of these nuclei and some by the\nnon-uniformity of the source distribution and propagation conditions. The\nobserved features of the spectra, also including a Z dependence of the peak\nintensities of the various nuclei, pose interesting problems related to the\npropagation and source distribution of these cosmic rays.\n",

We study the attitude motion of used rocket bodies acknowledgedly\nbelonging to one of the categories of large space debris objects that pose an\nimmediate danger to space operations in low Earth orbits. Particularly, we\nfocus on Sun-synchronous orbits (SSO) with altitudes in the interval 600-800\nkm, where the density of space debris is maximal. Our mathematical model takes\ninto account the gravity gradient torque and the torque due to eddy currents\ninduced by the interaction of conductive materials with the geomagnetic field.\nUsing perturbation techniques and numerical methods we examine the deceleration\nof the initial fast rotation and the subsequent transition to a relative\nequilibrium with respect to the local vertical. A better understanding of the\nlatter phase is achieved owing to a more accurate model of the eddy currents\ntorque than in most prior research. We show that SSO precession is also an\nimportant factor influencing the motion properties. One of its effects is\nmanifested at the deceleration stage as the angular momentum vector oscillates\nabout the direction to the south celestial pole.\n",

Nonlinear interactions among the\nturbulent fluctuations drive a cascade of energy to small perpendicular scales\nat which the energy is ultimately converted into plasma heat. Previous work\nwith the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations has shown that this\nturbulent energy cascade is driven by the nonlinear interaction between\ncounterpropagating Alfven waves - also known as Alfven wave collisions. Direct\nnumerical simulations of weakly collisional plasma turbulence enables deeper\ninsight into the nature of the nonlinear interactions underlying the turbulent\ncascade of energy. In this paper, we directly compare four cases: both periodic\nand localized Alfven wave collisions in the weakly and strongly nonlinear\nlimits. Our results reveal that in the more realistic case of localized Alfven\nwave collisions (rather than the periodic case), all nonlinearly generated\nfluctuations are Alfven waves, which mediates nonlinear energy transfer to\nsmaller perpendicular scales.\n",

The difference from piston shocks is that a\nblast-wave shock originates from the explosions that frequently accompany CME\nformation, and further propagates freely without any CME piston effects. The\nbow shock of Earth is a piston shock. Behind the bow shock front there is a\nflow of the modified solar wind plasma: transition layer, which also carries\nthe modified magnetic field of solar wind. Velocity and density of plasma as\nwell as parameters of magnetic field of this current can be estimated if the\nform of the bow shock front and of magnetopause are considered to be known. In\nthis paper we assumed them to be paraboloids of rotation. In this paper we have\ndetermined potential distribution along magnetopause from the balance condition\nof substance coming into transition layer from the solar wind on one side and\nleaving through the gap between magnetosphere and the bow shock front and\nthrough magnetopause on another. To a first approximation this distribution\ndiffers from potential distribution at the BS front only in a constant\nmultiplier. We used the established potential distribution as a boundary\ncondition while solving the problem on potential distribution in the\nmagnetosphere. The first solution harmonic turned out to coincide in the form\nwith the boundary condition on magnetopause. We have constructed the full\nsolution for electric field in the magnetosphere having limited ourselves to\nthe first harmonic and corotation field. We have obtained necessary equations\nto model processes in the region of bow shock.\n",

This energy\nbalance is demonstrated with a particle-in-cell simulation of reconnection. We\nalso evaluate each of the terms in Poynting's theorem during an observation of\na magnetopause reconnection region by Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS).

Our theory\nof the strahl broadening does not contain free parameters and it agrees with\nthe Wind observations at 1 AU to within $15-20\\%$. This indicates that Coulomb\nscattering, rather than anomalous turbulent diffusion, plays a dominant role in\nstrahl formation in these observations. We further propose that the nearly\nisotropic halo electron population may be composed of electrons that ran away\nfrom the sun as an electron strahl, but later ended up on magnetic field lines\nleading them back to the sun. Through the effects of magnetic defocusing and\nCoulomb pitch-angle scattering, a narrow source distribution at large\nheliocentric distances appears nearly isotropic at distances $\\sim$1 AU. The\nhalo electrons are, therefore, not produced locally; rather, they are the fast\nelectrons trapped by magnetic field lines on global heliospheric scales. At the\nelectron energies $K \\lesssim 200\\,\\, {\\rm eV}$, our theory is quite\ninsensitive to the particular mechanism that produces a population of\nsunward-streaming suprathermal particles. At larger energies, however, our\ntheory indicates that the scattering provided by Coulomb collisions alone is\nnot sufficient to isotropize a narrow sunward-propagating electron beam.\n",

With\nrapid developments in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning\napproaches are increasingly being used for pattern recognition. In this study,\nan approach from machine learning perspectives is developed to automatically\nclassify the solar wind at 1 AU into four types: coronal-hole-origin,\nstreamer-belt-origin, sector-reversal-region-origin, and ejecta. By exhaustive\nenumeration, an eight-dimensional scheme ($B_T$, $N_P$, $T_P$, $V_P$,\n$N_{\\alpha p}$, $T_{exp}/T_P$, $S_p$, and $M_f$) is found to perform the best\namong 8191 combinations of 13 solar wind parameters. 10 popular supervised\nmachine learning models, namely $k$ Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector\nMachines with linear and Radial Basic Function kernels, Decision Tree, Random\nForest, Adaptive Boosting, Neural Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Quadratic\nDiscriminant Analysis, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, are applied to the\nlabeled solar wind data sets. Among them, KNN classifier obtains the highest\noverall classification accuracy, 92.8%. It significantly improves the accuracy\nby 9.6% over existing manual schemes. No solar wind composition measurements\nare needed, permitting our classification scheme to be applied to most solar\nwind spacecraft data. Besides, two application examples indicate that solar\nwind classification is helpful for the risk evaluation of predicted magnetic\nstorms and surface charging of geosynchronous spacecrafts.\n",

The measured grounding resistances at a number of\nsubstations were also included in the model, which represents a considerable\nimprovement on previous models of the Irish power network for GIC calculations.\nSensitivity tests were performed to show how calculated GIC amplitudes are\naffected by different aspects of the model. These tests investigated: (1) How\nthe orientation of a uniform electric field affects GICs. (2) The effect of\nincluding/omitting lower-voltage elements of the power network. (3) How the\nsubstation grounding resistances assumptions affected GIC values. It was found\nthat changing the grounding resistance value had a considerable effect on\ncalculated GICs at some substations, and no discernible effect at others.\nFinally, five recent geomagnetic storm events were simulated in the network. It\nwas found that heavy rainfall prior to the 26-28 August 2015 geomagnetic storm\nevent may have had a measurable impact on measured GIC amplitudes at a 400/220\nkV transformer ground.\n",

It is applicable to magnetic\nturbulence only when the turbulent velocity fluctuations can practically be\ncompletely neglected against the bulk flow speed.

We retain only those cases where the impact\nparameter is less than one-half the FR radius, $R$, so the results should be\nrobust (29 cases). The SFR radii lie in the range [$\\sim$ 0.003, 0.059] AU.\nComparing results, we find that the Lundquist-alpha and uniform twist solutions\nyielded comparable and small normalized $\\chi^2$ values in most cases. We then\nuse Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction to analyze these events further. We then\nconsidered the twist per unit length, $\\tau$, both its profile through the FR\nand its absolute value.

A promising mechanism has been proposed by\nChandran et al. (2010), which in this paper we call \"magnetic moment breaking\"\n(MMB). As currently formulated, MMB dissipation operates only on the ion\nperpendicular motion, and does not influence their parallel temperature. Thus,\nthe MMB mechanism acting by itself produces coronal hole proton distributions\nthat are unstable to the ion-cyclotron anisotropy instability. This quasilinear\ninstability is expected to operate faster than the nonlinear turbulent cascade,\nscattering ions into the parallel direction and generating\nquasi-parallel-propagating ion-cyclotron (IC) waves. To investigate the\nconsequences of this instability on the MMB-heated protons, we construct a\nhomogeneous model for protons with coronal hole properties. Using a simplified\nversion of the resonant cyclotron interaction, we heat the protons by the MMB\nprocess and instantaneously scatter them to lower anisotropy while\nself-consistently generating parallel-propagating IC waves. We present several\nillustrative cases, finding that the extreme anisotropies implied by the MMB\nmechanism are limited to reasonable values, but the distinctive shape of the\nproton distribution derived by Klein & Chandran (2016) is not maintained. We\nalso find that these combined processes can result in somewhat higher particle\nenergization than the MMB heating alone. These quasilinear consequences should\nfollow from any kinetic mechanism that primarily increases the perpendicular\nion temperature in a collisionless plasma.\n",

        "summary": "  The acceleration of suprathermal electrons in the solar wind is mainly\nassociated with shocks driven by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs).\nIt is well known that the acceleration of electrons is much more efficient at\nquasi-perpendicular shocks than at quasi-parallel ones. Yang et al. (2018, ApJ,\n853, 89) (hereafter YEA2018) studied the acceleration of suprathermal electrons\nat a quasi-perpendicular ICME-driven shock event to claim the important role of\nshock drift acceleration (SDA). Here, we perform test-particle simulations to\nstudy the acceleration of electrons in this event, by calculating the\ndownstream electron intensity distribution for all energy channels assuming an\ninitial distribution based on the averaged upstream intensities. We obtain\nsimulation results similar to the observations from YEA2018 as follows. It is\nshown that the ratio of downstream to upstream intensities peaks at about\n90$^\\circ$ pitch angle. In addition, in each pitch angle direction the\ndownstream electron energy spectral index is much larger than the theoretical\nindex of diffusive shock acceleration. Furthermore, considering SDA, the\nestimated drift length is proportional to the electron energy but the drift\ntime is almost energy independent. Finally, we use a theoretical model based on\nSDA to describe the drift length and time, especially, to explain their energy\ndependence. These results indicate the importance of SDA in the acceleration of\nelectrons by quasi-perpendicular shocks.\n",

        "summary": "  It has long been known that large grounded conducting networks on the surface\nof Earth are affected by solar activity and geomagnetic storms. Power networks\nare such extensive grounded conductors and are susceptible to geomagnetically\ninduced currents (GICs). GICs at any specific node in a power network are\nassumed to be linearly related to the horizontal vector components of an\ninduced plane-wave geoelectric field by a pair of network parameters. These\nnetwork parameters are not easily measured in the network, but may be estimated\nempirically. In this work, we present a new approach of using an ensemble of\nnetwork parameters estimates. The ensembles include a huge number of parameter\npair estimates calculated from simultaneously solving pairs of time instances\nof the governing GIC equation. Each individual estimate is not the true state\nof the system, but a possible state. Taking the ensemble as a whole though\ngives the most probable parameter estimate. The most probable parameter\nestimate for both network parameters, as defined by their respective ensembles,\nis used directly in the modelling of GICs. The ensembles themselves however\nallow for further analysis into the nature of GICs. An improvement is seen when\ncomparing the out-of-sample performance of the ensemble estimates with previous\nGIC modelling in the South African power network during the Halloween Storm of\n2003. For the first time, it is shown that errors in the GIC modelling chain\nare absorbed into the network parameter estimates. Using a range of estimates\nfrom the ensemble, a GIC prediction band is produced. This band corresponds to\nan error estimate for predicted GIC. Furthermore, it has been explicitly shown\nthat estimated network parameters vary with GIC magnitude during an event. This\nbehaviour is then used to refine the parameter estimation further and allow for\nreal time dynamic network parameter estimation.\n",

This\nis especially useful in regions, such as southern Africa, where there is a\nsparse array of absolute magnetometers available for geomagnetic field\nmeasurements. In terms of geomagnetic field interpolation, the spherical\nelementary current systems (SECS) spatial interpolation scheme has shown to be\nvery successful, and the planar approximation of this method adequate for\nmodelling at mid-latitudes. The SECS interpolation scheme is physics based,\nmaking use of the Biot-Savart law and equivalent ionospheric currents to\ninterpolate measured geomagnetic field data. As with most interpolation\nmethods, more data points result in lower error. Therefore, we adapt the SECS\nmethod to work with variometers. These instruments measure variations in\nmagnetic field and are more abundant in southern Africa. Merging the two\nresulting interpolated datasets, the initial absolute geomagnetic field\ninterpolation can be significantly improved. This improved interpolation scheme\nis not only incredibly useful locally, where a sparse magnetometer array is a\nchallenge, but can also be applied just as effectively in other cases across\nthe globe where there are numerous magnetometers and variometers available.\n",

These instabilities play an active role\nin the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence\ninduced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a\n2.5 dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of\nAlfvenic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of\nturbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the\nterrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC\n  simulation is of decaying turbulence which develops both coherent structures\nand anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive kinetic\nscale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular\nto the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory\nusing the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the\nsimulation and the observations. Both the simulation and the observations show\nthat strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently in the\nplasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially\noccur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may\naffect the plasma globally , they act locally and develop in response to\nextreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent structures. Further\nstudies will be necessary to understand why there is an apparent correlation\nbetween linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.\n",

Here, we\npresent results from the analysis of 42 CMEs measured in the inner heliosphere\nby two spacecraft in radial conjunction. The magnetic field decrease with\ndistance provides a measure of their global expansion. Near 1 au, the decrease\nin their bulk speed provides a measure of their local expansion.

We\nfind that the expansion depends on the initial magnetic field strength inside\nthe ME, but not significantly on the magnetic field inside the ME measured near\n1 au. This is an indirect evidence that CME expansion in the innermost\nheliosphere is driven by the high magnetic pressure inside the ME, while by the\ntime the MEs reach 1 au, they are expanding due to the decrease in the solar\nwind dynamic pressure with distance. We also determine the evolution of the ME\ntangential and normal magnetic field components with distance, revealing\nsignificant deviations as compared to the expectations from force-free field\nconfigurations as well as some evidence that the front half of MEs expand at a\nfaster rate than the back half.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper investigates the influence of Earth's dipole tilt angle on the\nreverse convection cells (sometimes referred to as lobe cells) in the Northern\nHemisphere ionosphere during northward IMF, which we relate to high-latitude\nreconnection. Super Dual Auroral Radar Network plasma drift observations in\n2010-2016 are used to quantify the ionospheric convection. A novel technique\nbased on Spherical Elementary Convection Systems (SECS) that was presented in\nour companion paper (Reistad et al., 2019,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1029/2019JA026634) is used to isolate and quantify the\nreverse convection cells. We find that the dipole tilt angle has a linear\ninfluence on the reverse cell potential. In the Northern Hemisphere the reverse\ncell potential is typically two times higher in summer than in winter. This\nchange is interpreted as the change in interplanetary magnetic field-lobe\nreconnection rate due to the orientation of the dipole tilt. Hence, the dipole\ntilt influence on reverse ionospheric convection can be a significant\nmodification of the more known influence from v(O$_{sw}$)B(O$_{z}$). These\nresults could be adopted by the scientific community as key input parameters\nfor lobe reconnection coupling functions.\n",

The spacecraft were close to radial alignment throughout\nthe event, with a longitudinal separation of $3.6^{\\circ}$ between Juno and the\nspacecraft near Earth. The magnetic cloud likely originated from a filament\neruption on 22 October 2011 at 00:05 UT, and caused a strong geomagnetic storm\nat Earth commencing on 24 October. Observations of the magnetic cloud at each\nspacecraft have been analysed using Minimum Variance Analysis and two flux rope\nfitting models, Lundquist and Gold-Hoyle, to give the orientation of the flux\nrope axis. We explore the effect different trailing edge boundaries have on the\nresults of each analysis method, and find a clear difference between the\norientations of the flux rope axis at the near-Earth spacecraft and Juno,\nindependent of the analysis method. The axial magnetic field strength and the\nradial width of the flux rope are calculated using both observations and\nfitting parameters and their relationship with heliocentric distance is\ninvestigated. Differences in results between the near-Earth spacecraft and Juno\nare attributed not only to the radial separation, but to the small longitudinal\nseparation which resulted in a surprisingly large difference in the in situ\nobservations between the spacecraft. This case study demonstrates the utility\nof Juno cruise data as a new opportunity to study magnetic clouds beyond 1 AU,\nand the need for caution in future radial alignment studies.\n",

Known visual and semi-automated empirical methods of CS\nidentification are exact but do not allow a comprehensive statistical analysis\nof CS properties. Existing automated methods partially solve this problem.\nMeanwhile, these methods suggest an analysis of variations of the IMF and its\ndirection only. In our three-parameter empirical method, we employ both the\nsolar wind plasma and IMF parameters to identify CSs of various types.\nDerivatives of the IMF strength, the plasma beta and the ratio of the Alfv'en\nspeed VA to the solar wind speed V taken with the one-second cadence are used.\nWe find that the CS daily rate R correlates with the solar wind temperature T\nrather than with V and is proportional to the sum of the kinetic and thermal\nenergy density ~ V2(N+5N')+10T(N+N'), where N'=2cm^-3 is the background level\nof the solar wind density N.

Whistlers occur highly intermittently and 80% of\nthe whistlers appear continuously for less than 3 s. Occurrence rate of\nwhistler waves was found to be anti-correlated with the solar wind bulk\nvelocity. The study of the duration of the whistler intervals revealed an\nanti-correlation between the duration and the solar wind velocity, as well as\nbetween the duration and the normalized amplitude of magnetic field variations.\nThe pitch-angle widths (PAWs) of the field-aligned electron population referred\nto as the strahl are broader by at least 12 degrees during the presence of\nlarge amplitude narrow band whistler waves. This observation points towards a\nEM wave electron interaction, resulting in pitch-angle scattering. PAW of\nstrahl electrons corresponding to the short duration whistlers are higher\ncompared to the long duration whistlers. Parallel cuts through the strahl\nelectron velocity distribution function (VDF) observed during the whistler\nintervals appear to depart from the Maxwellian shape typically found in the\nnear-Sun strahl VDFs (Bercic et al. 2020). The relative decrease of parallel\nelectron temperature and the increase of PAW for the electrons in strahl energy\nrange suggests that the interaction with whistler waves results in a transfer\nof electron momentum from the parallel to the perpendicular direction.\n",

The spacecraft experiences a stream of\nMeV/nucleon impacts along the forward edge primarily from hydrogen and helium\nnuclei. The accumulation of implanted slowly diffusing gas atoms in solids\ndrives damage through the meso-scale processes of bubble formation, blistering,\nand exfoliation. This results in macroscopic changes to material properties\nand, in the cases of blistering and exfoliation, material erosion via blister\nrupture and delamination. Relativistic hydrogen and helium at constant velocity\nwill stop in the material at a similar depth, as predicted by Bethe-Bloch\nstopping and subsequent simulations of the implantation distribution, leading\nto a mixed hydrogen and helium system similar to that observed in fusion\nplasma-facing components (PFC's). However, the difference in location of\nnear-surface gas atoms with respect to the direction of exposure means that\npreviously developed empirical models of blistering cannot be used to predict\nbubble formation or blistering onset. In this work, we present a model of the\nlocal gas concentration threshold for material blistering from exposure to the\nISM at relativistic speeds. Expected effects on the spacecraft and mitigation\nstrategies are also discussed. The same considerations apply to the\nBreakthrough Starshot mission.\n",

This diffuse auroral\nfeature is characterized by four phases: (1) the initial phase exhibiting\nregular diffuse aurora, (2) the brightening phase, where an east-west auroral\nstripe rapidly brightens, (3) the eraser phase, where the stripe dims to below\nits initial state, and (4) the recovery phase, where the diffuse aurora returns\nto its original brightness. Using a superposed epoch analysis of 22 events, we\ncalculate the average recovery phase time to be 20 seconds, although this\nvaries widely between events.

We assume the supersonic neutral solar wind\nas the source of PUIs gyrating about the magnetic field in the outer\nheliosheath. These PUIs become energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) via charge\nexchange with interstellar hydrogen, and a portion of these ENAs are detected\nby spacecraft such as the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX}. To evaluate\nthe possibility of identifying the KHI on HP from ENA observations, we assume\nthat an imprint of the KHI may be displayed in spatial and temporal variations\nin the observed ENA profile. As an alternative to ENA, the column density of\nPUIs integrated across the HP is calculated. The KH-inducing vortex forces not\nonly background protons but also PUIs to roll up deep in the inner heliosheath.\nThe KH vortex also results in the emission of magnetosonic pulses that sweep\nPUIs in the outer heliosheath and lead to their local confinement. These\neffects elongate the PUIs spatial distribution in the direction normal to the\nHP. The appearance of the local confined structure in the PUIs column density\nis consequently confirmed, and this feature can be confirmed as the KHI\nevolution.

We propose improvements\nupon the classic first-order reconstruction method, as well as a second-order\nmethod, utilizing magnetometer measurements from a realistic nine-spacecraft\nobservatory. The improved first-order method, which averages over select\nensembles of four spacecraft, reconstructs the magnetic field associated with\nsimple current sheets and numerical simulations of turbulence accurately over\nlarger volumes compared to second-order methods or first-order methods using a\nsingle regular tetrahedron. Using this averaging method on data sets with fewer\nthan nine measurement points, the volume of accurate reconstruction compared to\na known magnetic vector field improves approximately linearly with the number\nof measurement points.\n",

        "summary": "  Erroneous GNSS positioning, failures in spacecraft operations and power\noutages due to geomagnetically induced currents are severe threats originating\nfrom space weather. Having knowledge of potential impacts on modern society in\nadvance is key for many end-user applications. This covers not only the timing\nof severe geomagnetic storms but also predictions of substorm onsets at polar\nlatitudes. In this study we aim at contributing to the timing problem of space\nweather impacts and propose a new method to predict the solar wind propagation\ndelay between Lagrangian point L1 and the Earth based on machine learning,\nspecifically decision tree models. The propagation delay is measured from the\nidentification of interplanetary discontinuities detected by the Advanced\nComposition Explorer (ACE) and their subsequent sudden commencements in the\nmagnetosphere recorded by ground-based magnetometers. A database of the\npropagation delay has been constructed on this principle including 380\ninterplanetary shocks. The feature set consists of six features, the three\ncomponents of each the solar wind speed and position of ACE around L1. The\nmachine learning results are compared to the flat propagation delay and the\nmethod based on the normal vector of solar wind discontinuities (vector delay).\nThe ML model achieves an RMSE of 4.5 min with respect to the measured solar\nwind propagation delay and also outperforms the physical flat and vector delay\nmodels by 50 \\% and 15 \\% respectively. To increase the confidence in the\npredictions of the trained GB model, we perform a performance validation,\nprovide feature importance and analyse the feature impact on the model output\nwith Shapley values. The major advantage of the machine learning approach is\nits simplicity when it comes to its application. After training, input from\nonly one ACE datapoint have to be fed into the algorithm for a prediction.\n",

In this region, collisions between the plasma and neutral\nmolecules allow currents to flow across B, enabling the entire\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere current system to close. These same currents cause\nstrong DC electric fields in the E-region ionosphere where they drive plasma\ninstabilities, including the Farley-Buneman instability (FBI). These\ninstabilities give rise to small-scale plasma turbulence that modifies the\nlarge-scale ionospheric conductance that, in turn, affects the evolution of the\nentire near-Earth plasma environment. Also, during geomagnetic storms,\nprecipitating electrons of high energies, $\\gtrsim$ 5 keV, frequently penetrate\ndown to the same regions where intense currents and E fields develop. This\nresearch examines the effects of precipitating electrons on the generation of\nthe FBI and shows that, under many common conditions, it can easily suppress\nthe instability in a predictable manner. Therefore, we expect precipitation to\nexert a significant feedback on the magnetosphere by preventing the elevated\nconductivity caused by FBI driven turbulence.

As a result, renewed interest in the exploitation of\nthese orbits has spurred the development of new technologies that have the\npotential to enable sustainable operations in this lower altitude range. In\nthis paper, system models are developed for (i) novel materials that improve\naerodynamic performance enabling reduced drag or increased lift production and\nresistance to atomic oxygen erosion and (ii) atmosphere-breathing electric\npropulsion (ABEP) for sustained drag compensation or mitigation in VLEO.\nAttitude and orbit control methods that can take advantage of the aerodynamic\nforces and torques in VLEO are also discussed.

To do so, we develop a predictive tool\nbased on machine learning that is trained and tested on 348 ICMEs from Wind,\nSTEREO-A, and STEREO-B measurements. We train the machine learning models to\npredict the minimum value of the Bz component and the maximum value of the\ntotal magnetic field Bz in the magnetic obstacle. To validate the tool, we let\nthe ICMEs sweep over the spacecraft and assess how continually feeding in situ\nmeasurements into the tool improves the Bz prediction. Because the application\nof the tool in operations needs an automated detection of ICMEs, we implement\nan existing automated ICME detection algorithm and test its robustness for the\ntime intervals under scrutiny.

The turbulent spectrum itself is defined\nby a power-law manifesting the energy cascading process. A break in the\nturbulence spectrum develops near ion scales, signaling the onset of energy\ndissipation. The exact mechanism for the spectral break is still a matter of\ndebate. In this work, we use the 20 Hz \\textit{MESSENGER} magnetic field data\nduring four planetary flybys at different heliocentric distances to examine the\nnature of the spectral break in the solar wind. %By carefully selecting the\nspacecraft trajectory, We relate the spectral break frequencies of the solar\nwind MHD turbulence, found in the range of $0.3$ to $0.7$ Hz, with the\nwell-known characteristic spectral bump at frequencies $\\sim 1$ Hz upstream of\nplanetary bow shocks. Spectral breaks and spectral bumps during three planetary\nflybys are identified from the \\textit{MESSENGER} observations, with\nheliocentric distances in the range of $0.3$ to $0.7$ au. The\n\\textit{MESSENGER} observations are complemented by one \\textit{MMS}\nobservation made at 1 au.

The higher values of GWPE\nare observed during morning, compared to post mid-night (35 o to 55 o latitude\nbin) for summer. As the latitude increases from 16 o to 45 o, GWPE (1-4 LT bin)\nis found to be nearly doubled for summer. Further, GWPE estimates in autumn are\n6 times higher during night compared to day (-45 o to -72 o latitude bin) and\ndaytime ( -53 o to -72 o latitude bin) GWPE is much lower in autumn compared to\nspring for all longitudes.

Two different\nproxies have been used to represent different levels of reconnection in the\nnear-Earth tail: The value of the AL index and the substorm phases identified\nby the Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet algorithm. We\nfind that the convection changes from a dominantly Y$_{GSM}$direction, but\nopposite in the two hemispheres, to a flow oriented more toward the plasma\nsheet, as the north-south component of the convection increases when\nreconnection enhances in the near Earth tail. This result is consistent with\nrecent observations of the convection in the ionosphere, which suggest that the\nnightside convection pattern becomes more north-south symmetric when tail\nreconnection increases. This is also supported by simultaneous auroral\nobservations from the two hemispheres, which shows that conjugate auroral\nfeatures become more symmetric during substorm expansion phase.

This process, however, competes\nwith perpendicular diffusion caused by magnetic turbulence, which can also\ndisrupt the drift patterns and reduce the efficiency of drift effects. The\nlatter phenomenon is well known in cosmic ray studies, but not yet considered\nin SEP models. Additionally, SEP models which do not include drifts, especially\nfor electrons, use turbulent drift reduction as a justification of this\nomission, without critically evaluating or testing this assumption. This\narticle presents the first theoretical step for a theory of drift suppression\nin SEP transport. This is done by deriving the turbulence-dependent drift\nreduction function with a pitch-angle dependence, as applicable for anisotropic\nparticle distributions, and by investigating to what extent drifts will be\nreduced in the inner heliosphere for realistic turbulence conditions and\ndifferent pitch-angle dependencies of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient.\nThe influence of the derived turbulent drift reduction factors on the transport\nof SEPs are tested, using a state-of-the-art SEP transport code, for several\nexpressions of theoretically-derived perpendicular diffusion coefficients. It\nis found, for realistic turbulence conditions in the inner heliosphere, that\ncross-field diffusion will have the largest influence on the perpendicular\ntransport of SEPs, as opposed to particle drifts.\n",

Data analyses\nbased on neural networks are difficult to interpret; however, PL learns by\nfocusing on the \"potentiality of input neurons\" and can identify which inputs\nare significantly utilized by the network. Using the full advantage of PL, we\nextracted the influential solar wind parameters that disturb the magnetosphere\nunder southward Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The input\nparameters of PL were the three components of the IMF (Bx, By, -Bz(Bs)), solar\nwind flow speed (Vx), and proton number density (Np) in geocentric solar\necliptic (GSE) coordinates obtained from the OMNI solar wind database between\n1998 and 2019. Furthermore, we classified these input parameters into two\ngroups (targets), depending on the Kp level: Kp = 6- to 9 (positive target) and\nKp = 0 to 1+ (negative target). Negative target samples were randomly selected\nto ensure that numbers of positive and negative targets were equal. The PL\nresults revealed that solar wind flow speed is an influential parameter for\nincreasing Kp under southward IMF conditions, which was in good agreement with\nprevious reports on the statistical relationship between the Kp index and solar\nwind velocity, and the Kp formulation based on the IMF and solar wind plasma\nparameters.

A major downside of the methodology,\nhowever, is that its control authority is (mainly) limited to the in-plane\nrelative motion control. By additionally applying differential lift, however,\nall three translational degrees-of-freedom become controllable. In this\narticle, we present a tool to flexibly plan optimal three-dimensional formation\nflight maneuvers via differential lift and drag. In the planning process, the\nmost significant perturbing effects in this orbital regime, namely the J2\neffect and atmospheric forces, are taken into account. Moreover, varying\natmospheric densities as well as the co-rotation of the atmosphere are\nconsidered. Besides its flexible and high-fidelity nature, the major assets of\nthe proposed methodology are that the in-and out-of-plane relative motion are\ncontrolled simultaneously via deviations in the yaw angles of the respective\nsatellites and that the planned trajectory is optimal in a sense that the\noverall decay during the maneuver is minimized. Thereby, the remaining lifetime\nof the satellites is maximized and the practicability and sustainability of the\nmethodology significantly increased.

The core-strahlo model is able to reproduce the main\nfeatures of the eVDF in the solar wind (thermal core, enhanced tails, and\nskewness), with the advantage that the asymmetry is controlled by only one\nparameter. In this work we use linear kinetic theory to analyze the effect of\nsolar wind electrons described by the core-strahlo model, over the excitation\nof the parallel propagating WHFI. We use parameters relevant to the solar wind\nand focus our attention on the effect on the linear stability introduced by\ndifferent values of the core-to-strahlo density and temperature ratios, which\nare known to vary throughout the Heliosphere. We also obtain the stability\nthreshold for this instability as a function of the electron beta and the\nskewness parameter, which is a better indicator of instability than the\nheat-flux macroscopic moment, and present a threshold conditions for the\ninstability that can be compared with observational data.\n",

Our method\nis based on the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which provides a means of\ndetermining spatiotemporal modes from measurements alone. DMD models are easily\nupdated as new data is recorded and do not require any physics to inform the\ndynamics. However, in the case of ionospheric profiles, we find a wide range of\noscillations, including some far above the diurnal frequency. Therefore, we\npropose nontrivial extensions to DMD using wavelet decompositions. We call this\nmethod the Scale-Separated Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SSDMD) since the\nwavelets isolate fluctuations at different time scales in the data into\nseparated components. We show that this method provides a stable reconstruction\nof the peak plasma density and can be used to predict the state of foF2 and\nhmF2 at future time steps. We demonstrate the SSDMD method on data sets\ncovering periods of high and low solar activity as well as low, mid, and high\nlatitude locations.\n",

Observations from Parker Solar\nProbe's (PSP's) first two solar encounters have formed the basis for many of\nthe described switchback properties and generation mechanisms. However, this\nearly data may not be representative of the typical near-Sun solar wind,\nbiasing our current understanding of these phenomena. One defining switchback\nproperty is the magnetic deflection direction. During the first solar\nencounter, this was primarily in the tangential direction for the longest\nswitchbacks, which has since been discussed as evidence, and a testable\nprediction, of several switchback generation methods. In this study, we\nre-examine the deflection direction of switchbacks during the first eight PSP\nencounters to confirm the existence of a systematic deflection direction. We\nfirst identify switchbacks exceeding a threshold deflection in the magnetic\nfield and confirm a previous finding that they are arc-polarized. In agreement\nwith earlier results from PSP's first encounter, we find that groups of longer\nswitchbacks tend to deflect in the same direction for several hours. However,\nin contrast to earlier studies, we find that there is no unique direction for\nthese deflections, although several solar encounters showed a non-uniform\ndistribution in deflection direction with a slight preference for the\ntangential direction. This result suggests a systematic magnetic configuration\nfor switchback generation, which is consistent with interchange reconnection as\na source mechanism, although this new evidence does not rule out other\nmechanisms, such as the expansion of wave modes.\n",

In the case of the Earth's magnetosphere, the plasma is\nusually composed by electrons, protons, O+, and He+ ions, all with their\nparticular properties and characteristics. Here, using plasma parameters\nrelevant for the inner magnetosphere we study the dispersion properties of\nKinetic Alfv\\'en Waves (KAW) in a plasma composed by electrons, protons, He+\nions, and O+ ions.

The pellets are slower than\nthe spacecraft and are accelerated backwards as they are overtaken, imparting a\nforward acceleration on the spacecraft. This maneuver is possible due to the\ninteraction with a fixed medium (interstellar medium, ISM); as the spacecraft\ntravels through the medium, it is able to extract power from the relative wind.\nThis concept relies upon the relative velocities (shear) between the pellet\nstream and the fixed medium in order to concentrate the energy of the pellets\ninto the spacecraft and is thus termed wind-pellet shear sailing. The equations\ngoverning the mass ratio of pellets to the spacecraft and its dependence on the\nfinal spacecraft velocity are derived; the critical role of the efficiency of\nthe power extraction and transfer process is identified. Natural sources of\nenergy are considered as a means to accelerate the pellets to velocities of\n1000 to 6000 km/s. Techniques for onboard generation of power via\nelectromagnetic interaction with the ISM are reviewed, with a repetitively\nstroked plasma magnet being identified as a promising approach. The necessity\nof the spacecraft to detect and track the pellets as they are overtaken\ndictates the desired properties of the pellets. Pellet pushers (accelerators)\non board the spacecraft are also preliminarily explored in their engineering\nconsiderations, with electric field accelerators of charged nanometric\nparticles, Lorentz-force accelerated ionized pellets, or expansion of vaporized\npellets via a nozzle being highlighted as potential approaches. A preliminary\nmission profile is defined in which a 500-kg scientific payload is delivered to\norbit about alpha-Centauri within 30 years, using wind-pellet shear sailing as\nthe intermediate stage to bring the spacecraft from 2% to 5.5% of c.\n",

However, this approach does not consider the fact that very\ndiverse spectral shapes exist at a given L-shell and magnetic local time.\nAveraging the data together means that important features of the spectral\nshapes are lost. In this paper, we use an unsupervised machine learning\ntechnique to categorize plasmaspheric hiss. In contrast to the previous\nstudies, this technique allows us to identify power spectra that have \"similar\"\nshapes and study their spatial distribution without averaging together vastly\ndifferent spectral shapes. We show that strong negative correlations exist\nbetween the hiss frequency and bandwidth, which suggests that the observed\npatterns are consistent with in situ wave growth.\n",

The\nsolar wind coupling with the terrestrial magnetosphere is a key link in\nSun-Earth interactions. In-situ missions can provide detailed observations of\nplasma and magnetic field conditions in the solar wind and the magnetosphere,\nbut leave us still unable to fully quantify the global effects of the drivers\nof Sun-Earth connections, and to monitor their evolution. This information is\nessential to develop a comprehensive understanding of how the Sun controls the\nEarth's plasma environment and space weather. SMILE offers a new approach to\nglobal monitoring of geospace by imaging the magnetosheath and cusps in X-rays\nemitted when high charge-state solar wind ions exchange charges with exospheric\nneutrals. SMILE combines this with simultaneous UV imaging of the northern\naurora and in-situ plasma and magnetic field measurements in the magnetosheath\nand solar wind from a highly elliptical northern polar orbit. In this chapter\nthe science that SMILE will explore and the scientific preparations that will\nensure the optimal exploitation of SMILE measurements are presented.\n",

Despite a limited amount of observations, they\npresent high scientific interest for the research community. In order to\nfurther analyze these objects, in-situ data is required.

Consequently,\"build-and-wait\"\nis an appealing mission concept. To prepare the upcoming missions to ISOs it is\nrequired to have a deeper knowledge on the probability analysis to locate these\nobjects within the Solar System. Therefore, the optimum location to intercept\nthese objects has been studied by performing a computational analysis using the\nRunge-Kutta RKF4(5) numerical method. This method has been used to determine\nthe likelihood of ISOs trajectories intercepting the ecliptic. The results show\na peak at a distance of ~1 AU from the Sun. Therefore, the vicinity of the\nEarth's orbit is the best position to send or place a spacecraft for ISO\ninterception. In addition, these results add validity to the theory of\npanspermia via ISO impact. The author has estimated an annual probability of\nISO-Earth impact of 10$^{-7}$.\n",

The growth in LEO objects directly\nincreases the probability of unintentional collisions between objects due to\naccumulating space debris. Effective space traffic management needs accurate\nknowledge of the variability in upper atmosphere densities. Data assimilative\nmodeling, where physics-based models are informed by measurements, supplies the\nbest capability today for specifying and predicting space weather. The\nfoundation for this modeling comes from the SET High Accuracy Satellite Drag\nModel (HASDM) density database. We report on studies to understand the\nvariabilities in HASDM. We identify two thermospheric features from the SET\nHASDM density database. First, we have confirmed that the time scale is very\nrapid (1-hour) for molecular conduction above 200 km to transfer energy\nvertically in the thermosphere. This results couples with a longer timescale\nfor conduction in the 100-200 km region where it takes up to 2 days for energy\nto transition across that region via molecular conduction. We now have an\nexcellent picture of the timescales of energy change throughout the\nthermosphere. Second, the SET HASDM density data display a common range of\nvariability despite the level of daily averaged geomagnetic activity as\nrepresented by Ap. During higher levels of daily averaged geomagnetic activity,\nthe density mean and median values increase at all altitude levels. However,\nthe relative range of variability is consistent from one daily average of Ap to\nthe next. The reason is likely to be that the underlying pre-storm density of\nthe thermosphere is determined by the solar EUV and FUV irradiances that create\na thermal foundation of the upper atmosphere. The daily averaged geomagnetic\nactivity is a perturbation upon that foundation.\n",

Evidence\npoints to the beam being produced at higher altitudes by incident relativistic\nelectrons coming from the Van Allen radiation belts and that have been\ngenerated by electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. The EMIC waves have\nbeen inferred by ground observatory, aircraft air, and satellite space\nobservations as well as from modeling. We do not rule out other radiation\nsources associated with geomagnetic substorms and radiation belt coupling\nalthough these enhanced radiation events seem to frequently occur even during\nvery minor geomagnetic disturbed conditions. These events show a dynamic and\nvariable radiation environment at aircraft altitudes in a narrow magnetic\nlatitude band (43-67 N, S; L-shells between 2 and 7). Observations are of dose\nrate enhancements that are statistically significant above the galactic cosmic\nray (GCR) background. Measurements indicate that between 11-12 km during quiet\ngeomagnetic conditions and at L-shell 4, the effective dose rate can be 32\npercent higher than from GCRs alone. For the events themselves the mean\neffective dose rate is nearly double that for the background GCR level. The\nimplication is that background exposure rates for North Atlantic (NAT), North\nPacific (NoPAC), and the northern half of continental U.S. (CONUS) air traffic\nroutes are typically higher than if one only considers GCRs. The net effect on\naircraft crew and frequent flyers for these routes will be an increase in the\nmonthly and annual exposures, which may have career-limiting health\nconsequences.\n",

We present here the first multi-spacecraft observations of\nshocklets observed by upstream of an unusually strong IP shock observed on\nNovember 3rd 2021 by several spacecraft at L1 and near-Earth solar wind. The\nsame shock was detected also by radially aligned Solar Orbiter at 0.8 AU from\nthe Sun, but no shocklets were identified from its data, introducing the\npossibility to study the environment in which shocklets developed. The Wind\nspacecraft has been used to characterise the shocklets, associated with\npre-conditioning of the shock upstream by decelerating incoming plasma in the\nshock normal direction. Finally, using the Wind observations together with ACE\nand DSCOVR spacecraft at L1, as well as THEMIS B and THEMIS C in the near-Earth\nsolar wind, the portion of interplanetary space filled with shocklets is\naddressed, and a lower limit for its extent is estimated to be of about 110\n$R_E$ in the shock normal direction and 25 $R_E$ in the directions transverse\nto the shock normal.

In the past years, several\ndiagnostics have been developed to address key shock parameters using time\nseries of magnetic field (and plasma) data collected by a single spacecraft\ncrossing a shock front. A critical aspect of such diagnostics is the averaging\nprocess involved in the evaluation of upstream-downstream quantities. In this\nwork, we discuss several of these techniques, with a particular focus on the\nshock obliquity (defined as the angle between the upstream magnetic field and\nthe shock normal vector) estimation. We introduce a systematic variation of the\nupstream/downstream averaging windows, yielding to an ensemble of shock\nparameters, a useful tool to address the robustness of their estimation. This\napproach is first tested with a synthetic shock, compliant with the\nRankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for a shock, including the presence of noise\nand disturbances. We then employ self-consistent, hybrid kinetic shock\nsimulations to apply the diagnostics to virtual spacecraft crossing the shock\nfront at various stages of its evolution, highlighting the role of\nshock-induced fluctuations in the parameters estimation. This approach has the\nstrong advantage of retaining some important properties of collisionless shock\nwhile being able to set a known, nominal set of shock parameters. Finally, two\nrecent observations of interplanetary shocks from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft\nare presented, and the approach is also tested on an interplanetary shock\nmeasured by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.\nAll the Python software developed and used for the diagnostics (SerPyShock) is\nmade available for the public, including an example of parameter estimation for\na shock wave recently observed in-situ by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft.\n",

A sinusoidal\nperturbation is introduced into a two-dimensional thin-film sail to determine\nif the sail remains stable or if the perturbations grow in amplitude. A\nreflective material that gives specular reflection of the laser illumination is\nassumed in determining the resulting loading on the sail, although other\nreflection models can be incorporated as well. The quasi-static solution of the\ncritical point between shape stability and instability is found by equating the\nbending moments induced on the sail due to radiation pressure with the\nrestoring moments caused by the strength of the sail and the tension applied at\nthe edges of the sail, permitting analytical expressions for the elastic\nmodulus and boundary tension magnitude to be found as a function of sail\nproperties and the amplitude and wave number of the initial perturbation. These\nexpressions are also derived from a formal variational energy approach. A\nnumerical model of the sail dynamics is developed by discretizing the sail into\nfinite elements. By introducing torsional and rectilinear springs between the\nelements into the numerical model, a hierarchy of models is produced that can\nincorporate the effects of bending and applied tension. The numerical models\npermit the transient dynamics of a perturbed sail to be compared to the\nanalytic results of the quasi-static analysis. The analytic expressions can\ncorrectly predict the stability boundary found in the numerical simulations.\nThe stiffness required to make a sail stable against uncontrolled perturbation\ngrowth is shown to be unfeasible for known materials. A modest tensioning of\nthe sail (e.g., via an inflatable structure or spinning of the sail) can\nmaintain a stable sail shape under all wavelengths and amplitudes of\nperturbations.\n",

The spacecraft motion can be modeled as a series of elastic\ncollisions between regions of the medium moving at different speeds. Models of\nthe trajectory are developed to predict the potential velocity gains and the\nmaximum velocity that may be achieved in terms of the lift-to-drag ratio of the\nvehicle. A lift-generating mechanism is proposed in which power is extracted\nfrom the flow over the vehicle in the flight direction and then used to\naccelerate the surrounding medium in the transverse direction, generating lift.\nLarge values of lift-to-drag ratio are shown to be possible in the case where a\nsmall transverse velocity is imparted over a large area of interaction. The\nrequirement for large interaction area in the extremely low density of the\nheliosphere precludes the use of physical wings, but the use of plasma waves\ngenerated by compact, directional antennas to impart momentum on the\nsurrounding medium is feasible, with R-waves, X-waves, Alfven, and magnetosonic\nwaves appearing as promising candidates.

We investigate temporal and spatial scales of such precipitation\nwith measurements from the two low-altitude ELFIN CubeSats. We compare the\nvariations in energetic electron precipitation at the same L-shells but on\nsuccessive data collection orbit tracks by the two ELFIN satellites. Variations\nseen at the smallest inter-satellite separations are likely associated with\nwhistler-mode chorus elements or with the scale of chorus wave packets (0.1 - 1\ns in time and 100 km in space at the equator). Variations between precipitation\nL-shell profiles at intermediate inter-satellite separations are likely\nassociated with whistler-mode wave power modulations by ultra-low frequency\n(ULF) waves, i.e., with the wave source region (from a few to tens of seconds\nto a few minutes in time and 1000km in space at the equator). During these two\ntypes of variations, consecutive crossings are associated with precipitation\nL-shell profiles very similar to each other. Therefore the spatial and temporal\nvariations at those scales do not change the net electron loss from the outer\nradiation belt. Variations at the largest range of inter-satellite separations,\nseveral minutes to more than 10 min, are likely associated with mesoscale\nequatorial plasma structures that are affected by convection (at minutes to\ntens of minutes temporal variations and [1000,10000]km spatial scales). The\nlatter type of variations results in appreciable changes in the precipitation\nL-shell profiles and can significantly modify the net electron losses during\nsuccessive tracks.\n",

To achieve this, rapid transit will be required to\nbring crucial cargo. Current missions to Mars take 150 days, which would be too\nlong for emergencies or urgent needs. Therefore, we propose the use of a\ncutting-edge technology that could allow 20-day transit times: laser energy\ndriven light sails. This propulsion method uses a ground-based laser array to\npropel a spacecraft attached to a light sail to high speeds, enabling missions\nthat are much faster than current missions. By utilizing a MATLAB model and a\nlaser propulsion tool, we visualize and determine optimal trajectories and\ndeparture windows for such missions. We discuss and show that these missions\nare possible during specific launch windows in a 27-month timeframe between\n2030-2032, but also have practical challenges. During solar conjunction, such\nmissions are limited by solar proximity, but are possible during all orbital\nphases if the transit time requirement is relaxed. Laser arrays capable of\ngenerating 13 GW are necessary to enable 20-day missions with a 5 kg spacecraft\nnear conjunction, but only 0.55 GW is required near opposition. The spacecraft\nhas a hyperbolic trajectory and is not bound to the solar system during\ntransit. A challenge for future work involves the deceleration and entry,\ndescent, and landing phases. A laser array on Mars could address some of this\nchallenge. Spacecraft mass capabilities can be increased by optimizing the\nlaser array and sail properties. Multiple spacecraft may be boosted\nsimultaneously to carry more payload at lower costs. This work is intended to\nserve as proof of concept that lightweight payloads can be transported via such\nmissions. Technologies enabling 20-day missions can be developed in the future\nand be applied to advanced missions to celestial bodies and interstellar space.\n",

While precipitating particle fluxes have been\nmeasured by numerous spacecraft missions over the past decades, it often\nremains difficult to obtain global precipitation patterns with a good time\nresolution during a substorm. Numerical simulations can help to bridge this gap\nand improve the understanding of mechanisms leading to particle precipitation\nat high latitudes through the global view they offer on the near-Earth space\nsystem. We present the first results on auroral (0.5-50 keV) proton\nprecipitation within a 3-dimensional simulation of the Vlasiator hybrid-Vlasov\nmodel. The run is driven by southward interplanetary magnetic field conditions\nwith constant solar wind parameters. We find that, on the dayside, cusp proton\nprecipitation exhibits the expected energy-latitude dispersion and takes place\nin the form of successive bursts associated with the transit of flux transfer\nevents formed through dayside magnetopause reconnection. On the nightside, the\nprecipitation takes place within the expected range of geomagnetic latitudes,\nand it appears clearly that the precipitating particle injection is taking\nplace within a narrow magnetic local time span, associated with fast Earthward\nplasma flows in the near-Earth magnetotail. Finally, the simulated\nprecipitating fluxes are compared to observations from Defense Meteorological\nSatellite Program spacecraft during driving conditions similar to those in the\nsimulation and are found to be in good agreement with the measurements.\n",

In this work, using the PSP observations from encounters\n4 to 10, we identify streamer belt solar wind from enhancements in plasma beta,\nand we further use electron pitch angle distributions to separate it into HPS\nsolar wind that around the full HCS crossings and PCS solar wind that in the\nvicinity of PCS crossings. Based on our analysis, we find that the PCS solar\nwind has different characteristics as compared with HPS solar wind: a) PCS\nsolar wind could be non-pressure-balanced structures rather than magnetic\nholes, and the total pressure enhancement mainly results from the less reduced\nmagnetic pressure; b) some of the PCS solar wind are mirror unstable; c) PCS\nsolar wind is dominated by very low helium abundance but varied alpha-proton\ndifferential speed.

Studies in recent years have\nexplored the implications of FLC scattering on the precipitation of both ring\ncurrent ions and radiation belt electrons. In this work, we first compare two\nprevious FLC scattering coefficients using test particle calculations. Then, we\nsystematically calculate diffusion coefficients from FLC scattering in radial\nand MLT directions for particles of various energy levels, as well as its\nsensitivity to the $Kp$ index. We find that the timescale of FLC scattering is\nsufficient to account for the sudden loss of MeV electrons near the\ngeostationary orbit during disturbed times. Additionally, the decay time of\nring current protons is on the order of hours to minutes, providing an\nexplanation for the ring current decay throughout the recovery phase of\nmagnetic storms. Lastly, we compare the effects of wave-particle resonant\nscattering and FLC scattering in the vicinity of the midnight equator. Our\nfindings suggest that the impacts of FLC scattering on MeV electrons or\nhundreds keV protons with smaller pitch angle is comparable to, or even more\nsignificant than, the effects of whistler mode or EMIC wave resonant\nscattering. Our quantitative results should be useful to evaluate the\nimportance of the effects of FLC scattering while modeling the dynamics of\nradiation belt and ring current.\n",

There are many different types\nof waves, and it is important to quantify the wave energy density and growth\nrate for understanding what type of wave instabilities are possible in\ndifferent plasma regimes. There are many situations throughout the universe\nwhere plasmas contain a significant fraction of relativistic particles.\nTheoretical estimates for the wave energy density and growth rate are\nconstrained to either field-aligned propagation angles, or non-relativistic\nconsiderations. Based on linear theory, we derive the analytic expressions for\nthe energy density and growth rate of an arbitrary resonant wave with an\narbitrary propagation angle in relativistic plasmas. For this derivation, we\ncalculate the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of the relativistic-plasma\ndielectric tensor. We demonstrate that our analytic expression for the wave\nenergy density presents an explicit energy increase of resonant waves in the\nwavenumber range where the analytic expression for the growth rate is positive\n(i.e., where a wave instability is driven). For this demonstration, we\nnumerically analyse the loss-cone driven instability, as a specific example, in\nwhich the whistler-mode waves scatter relativistic electrons into the loss cone\nin the radiation belt. Our analytic results further develop the basis for\nlinear theory to better understand the wave instability, and have the potential\nto combine with quasi-linear theory, which allows to study the time evolution\nof not only the particle momentum distribution function but also resonant wave\nproperties through an instability.\n",

Normal\ninterplanetary magnetic field intensities of ~5 nT have previously been shown\nto be sufficient to explain the ~+120 nT SI+ observed at Colaba during the\nstorm (Tsurutani et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024779).\nMagnetohydrodynamic theory (Kennel et al., 1985,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1029/GM034p0001) predicts a maximum of 4x magnetic field\ncompression by a fast shock, giving an interplanetary sheath field of ~20 nT, a\nvalue too low to support the Ohtani (2022) hypothesis. The Ohtani (2022) (and\nSiscoe et al. 2006, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2005.02.102) claim of a\nfurther 10x amplification of the interplanetary sheath fields has not been\nverified in near-Earth interplanetary sheaths.

However, the model chain has eleven uncertain parameters\nthat are mainly non-physical due to empirical relations and simplified physics\nassumptions. We, therefore, propose a comprehensive uncertainty quantification\n(UQ) framework that is able to successfully quantify and reduce parametric\nuncertainties in the model chain. The UQ framework utilizes variance-based\nglobal sensitivity analysis followed by Bayesian inference via Markov chain\nMonte Carlo to learn the posterior densities of the most influential\nparameters. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the five most\ninfluential parameters are all WSA parameters. Additionally, we show that the\nposterior densities of such influential parameters vary greatly from one\nCarrington rotation to the next. The influential parameters are trying to\novercompensate for the missing physics in the model chain, highlighting the\nneed to enhance the robustness of the model chain to the choice of WSA\nparameters.

At Earth, the solar wind's outward pressure\nis balanced by the Earth's magnetic field in a boundary layer known as the\nmagnetopause. Plasma density and temperature differences across the boundary\nlayer generate the Chapman-Ferraro current which supports the magnetopause.\nAlong the dayside magnetopause, magnetic reconnection can occur in electron\ndiffusion regions (EDRs) embedded into the larger ion diffusion regions (IDRs).\nThese diffusion regions form when opposing magnetic field lines in the solar\nwind and Earth's magnetic field merge, releasing magnetic energy into the\nsurrounding plasma. While previous studies have given us a general\nunderstanding of the structure of the diffusion regions, we still do not have a\ngood grasp of how they are statistically differentiated from the non-diffusion\nregion magnetopause. By investigating 251 magnetopause crossings from NASA's\nMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Mission, we demonstrate that EDR magnetopause\ncrossings show current densities an order of magnitude higher than regular\nmagnetopause crossings - crossings that either passed through the reconnection\nexhausts or through the non-reconnecting magnetopause, providing a baseline for\nthe magnetopause current sheet under a wide range of driving conditions.\nSignificant current signatures parallel to the local magnetic field in EDR\ncrossings are also identified, which is in contrast to the dominantly\nperpendicular current found in the regular magnetopause. Additionally, we show\nthat the ion velocity along the magnetopause is highly correlated with a\ncrossing's location, indicating the presence of magnetosheath flows inside the\nmagnetopause.\n",

However, these systems are very sensitive to\nsolar activity. Therefore, all activities above are vulnerable and defenseless\nagainst the catastrophic changes in Earth's cosmic environment. The Solar\nSystem is dominated by the influence of our star. A small fraction of the\nenergy produced in the core of our star turns into a magnetic field and emits\nthe constant high-velocity flow, the solar wind. Solar magnetic activity\nproduces radiation and ejects matter from the upper atmosphere of our star. The\nmagnetic field of the solar wind interacts with the planetary magnetic fields\nand atmospheres. These phenomena, called Space Weather have a serious influence\non the radiation environment of Earth where telecommunication, Global\nNavigation Satellite System, meteorological, and other purpose satellites are\nlocated. The conductivity and transparency of the higher partly ionized\natmospheric layer, the ionosphere also depend on solar radiation and activity.\nThis fact makes the navigation and communication systems dependent on solar\nactivity. Finally, the solar magnetic activity creates magnetic variations in\nthe terrestrial magnetic field and induces currents in gas pipelines,\ntransmission lines, overhead wires, and transformers. In this short briefing,\nwe introduce the solar activity phenomena, and their influence on our planet's\ncosmic neighborhood and provide a detailed description of the Space Weather\neffects on critical infrastructure. We describe the Hungarian national and\nglobal space weather forecast centers and capabilities. Finally, we share some\nguidelines on how to prepare for extreme space weather events.\n",

We were able to use real time science\nquality magnetic field measurements, taken only 12 minutes earlier, to predict\nthe arrival time of a CME prior to reaching Earth. We used measurements at\nSolar Orbiter to constrain an ensemble of simulation runs from the ELEvoHI\nmodel, reducing the uncertainty in arrival time from 10.4\\,hours to 2.5\\,hours.\nThere was also an excellent agreement in the $B_z$ profile between Solar\nOrbiter and Wind spacecraft, despite being separated by 0.5\\,AU and\n10$^{\\circ}$ longitude. Therefore, we show that it is possible to predict not\nonly the arrival time of a CME, but the sub-structure of the magnetic field\nwithin it, over a day in advance.

Especially those satellites without thrusting capabilities face\nthe problem of not being able to perform impulsive collision avoidance\nmanoeuvres. For satellites in Low Earth Orbits, though, perturbing\naccelerations due to aerodynamic drag may be used to influence their\ntrajectories, thus offering a possibility to avoid collisions without consuming\npropellant. Here, this manoeuvring option is investigated for the satellite\nFlying Laptop of the University of Stuttgart, which orbits the Earth at\napproximately 600 km. In a first step, the satellite is aerodynamically\nanalysed making use of the tool ADBSat. By employing an analytic equation from\nliterature, in-track separation distances can then be derived following a\nvariation of the ballistic coefficient through a change in attitude. A further\nexamination of the achievable separation distances proves the feasibility of\naerodynamic collision avoidance manoeuvres for the Flying Laptop for moderate\nand high solar and geomagnetic activity. The predicted separation distances are\nfurther compared to flight data, where the principle effect of the manoeuvre on\nthe satellite trajectory becomes visible. The results suggest an applicability\nof collision avoidance manoeuvres for all satellites in comparable and\nespecially in lower orbits than the Flying Laptop, which are able to vary their\nballistic coefficient.\n",

Current analysis estimates that the likely erosion rates are of\norder 10^-11-10^-8 g/s and that the frontal area temperature for the models\nexamined in this paper will be 135.2 K depending on the ratio of frontal area\nto radiating area.

The\nassumption of a bin-wise constant cloud density allows for the analytical\ntransformation of the six-dimensional distribution in orbital elements into the\nthree-dimensional spatial density function, guaranteeing an efficient and\naccurate evaluation of the fragments flux. The proposed method is applied to\nthe assessment of the collision risk posed by real fragmentation clouds in\ndifferent orbital regions on a high-risk target object. The effect on the\nimpact rate of the additional model features, compared to previous\nprobabilistic formulations, is discussed.\n",

In many models, the centrifugal equator is\nassumed to lay on a plane, calculated from a (shifted) dipole magnetic field,\nrather than on a warped surface which incorporates Jupiter's higher magnetic\nfield moments. In this work, we use Hubble Space Telescope observations of the\nIo Main Footprint to constrain density, scale height and lateral position of\nthe Io Plasma Torus. Therefore, we employ the leading angle of the footprints\nto calculate expected travel times of Alfven waves and carry out an inversion\nof the observations. For the magnetic field we use the JRM33 magnetic field\nmodel. The inversion results show peak densities between 1830 and 2032\nparticles per cubic centimenter and scale heights between 0.92 and 0.97 Jupiter\nradii consistent with current literature values. Using a warped multipole\ncentrifugal equator instead of a planar dipole increases the quality of the fit\nby about twenty-five percent. We additionally develop two tests to confirm that\nthe multipole centrifugal equator from the JRM33 model fits explains the\napplied data set better than the dipole centrifugal equator. The quadropole\nmoments alter Io's relative position to the torus, which changes the plasma\ndensity around Io by up to twenty percent.\n",

The\nnew surveys extend the linear relationship among data taken at different cutoff\nrigidity ranges.

The terrestrial\nMagnetospheric System is a key case where direct measures of plasma\nenergization and energy transport can be made in situ at high resolution.\nDespite the large amount of available observations, we still do not fully\nunderstand how plasma energization and energy transport work. Key physical\nprocesses driving much plasma energization and energy transport occur where\nplasma on fluid scales couple to the smaller ion kinetic scales. These scales\n(1 RE) are strongly related to the larger mesoscales (several RE) at which\nlarge-scale plasma energization and energy transport structures form. All these\nscales and processes need to be resolved experimentally, however existing\nmulti-point in situ observations do not have a sufficient number of measurement\npoints. New multiscale observations simultaneously covering scales from\nmesoscales to ion kinetic scales are needed. The implementation of these\nobservations requires a strong international collaboration in the coming years\nbetween the major space agencies. The Plasma Observatory is a mission concept\ntailored to resolve scale coupling in plasma energization and energy transport\nat fluid and ion scales. It targets the two ESA-led Medium Mission themes\nMagnetospheric Systems and Plasma Cross-scale Coupling of the ESA Voyage 2050\nreport and is currently under evaluation as a candidate for the ESA M7 mission.\nMagCon (Magnetospheric Constellation) is a mission concept being studied by\nNASA aiming at studying the flow of mass, momentum, and energy through the\nEarth magnetosphere at mesoscales. Coordination between Plasma Observatory and\nMagCon missions would allow us for the first time to simultaneously cover from\nmesoscales to ion kinetic scales leading to a paradigm shift in the\nunderstanding of the Earth Magnetospheric System.\n",

Two case studies are shown, one from 15th December\n2016, and one from 30th January 2018, in which well-defined main signal fades\nand secondary diffraction fringing are observed. In particular, the broadband\nobserving capabilities of LOFAR permit us to see considerable frequency\ndependent behaviour in the QPOs which, to our knowledge, is a new result. We\nextract some of the clearest examples of scintillation arcs reported in an\nionospheric context, from delay-Doppler spectral analysis of these two events.\nThese arcs permit the extraction of propagation velocities for the plasma\nstructures causing the QPOs ranging from 50 - 200 ms$^{-1}$, depending on the\nassumed altitude. The spacing between the individual plasma structures ranges\nbetween 5 - 20 km. The periodicities of the main signal fades in each event\nand, in the case of the 2018 data, co-temporal ionosonde data, suggest the\npropagation of the plasma structures causing the QPOs is in the E-region. Each\nof the two events is accurately reproduced using a Gaussian perturbation phase\nscreen model. Individual signal fades and enhancements were modelled using\nsmall variations in total electron content (TEC) amplitudes of order 1 mTECu,\ndemonstrating the sensitivity of LOFAR to very small fluctuations in\nionospheric plasma density. To our knowledge these results are among the most\ndetailed observations and modelling of QPOs in the literature.\n",

The MVSE mission comprises four satellites, of which three are\nidentical scientific spacecraft, carrying the same suite of instruments probing\ndifferent regions of the induced magnetosphere and the solar wind\nsimultaneously. The fourth spacecraft is the transfer vehicle which acts as a\nrelay satellite for communications at Venus. In this way, changes in the solar\nwind conditions and extreme solar events can be observed, and their effects can\nbe quantified as they propagate through the Venusian induced magnetosphere.\nAdditionally, energy transfer in the Venusian induced magnetosphere can be\ninvestigated.

Broadband trans ionospheric radio scintillation\nobservations of these phenomena are, to our knowledge, unreported in the\nliterature as is the ability to track asymmetric QPS generating plasma\nstructures over such a distance. Type 1 asymmetric QPS are characterised by an\ninitial broadband signal fade and enhancement which is then followed by\n'ringing pattern' interference fringes. These are caused by diffractive\nfringing as the radio signal transitions through regions of relatively steep\nplasma density gradient at the trailing edge of the plasma structures. That the\nQPS retained their characteristics consistently over the full observing window\nimplies that the plasma structures generating them likewise held their form for\nseveral hours, and over the full 1200 km distance. The most likely TID\npropagation altitude of 110 km was consistent with a persistent and non\nblanketing sporadic E region detected by the Juliusruh ionosondes, and direct\nmeasurements from co-located medium frequency radar. Co-temporal GNSS data was\nused to establish that these plasma density variations were very small, with a\nmaximum likely amplitude of no more than +/- 0.02 TECu deviation from the\nbackground average. The observations were made between 0430-0800 UT on 17\nDecember 2018 under very quiet geophysical conditions which possibly indicated\na terrestrial source. Given the TID propagation direction, the source was\nlikely located at high-latitude.\n",

Specifically, it was observed that the\ntransmit power required to operate a 250W Polaris rover at a distance of 20km\nwas on the order of several kilowatts. Additionally, it was noted that in the\nMoon's darker regions, the impact of lunar dust on transmission was nearly\nnegligible, making these areas more conducive for FSO-based energy\ntransmission.\n",

To forecast foreshock-driven space weather\neffects, it is necessary to model foreshock ions as a function of upstream\nshock parameters. Case studies in the accompanying paper show that\nmagnetosheath ions sometimes exhibit strong field-aligned anisotropy towards\nthe upstream direction, which may be responsible for enhancing magnetosheath\nleakage and therefore foreshock ion density. To understand the conditions\nleading to such an anisotropy and the potential for enhanced leakage, we\nperform case studies and a statistical study of magnetosheath and foreshock\nregion data surrounding ~500 THEMIS bow shock crossings. We quantify the\nanisotropy using the heat flux along the field-aligned direction. We show that\nthe strong field-aligned heat flux persists across the entire magnetosheath\nfrom the magnetopause to the bow shock. Ion distribution functions reveal that\nthe strong heat flux is caused by a secondary thermal population. We find that\nstronger anisotropy events exhibit heat flux preferentially towards the\nupstream direction near the bow shock and occur under larger IMF strength and\nlarger solar wind dynamic pressure and/or energy flux. Additionally, we show\nthat near the bow shock, magnetosheath leakage is a significant contributor to\nforeshock ions, and through enhancing the leakage the magnetosheath ion\nanisotropy can modulate the foreshock ion velocity and density. Our results\nimply that likely due to field line draping and compression against the\nmagnetopause that leads to a directional mirror force, modeling the foreshock\nions necessitates a more global accounting of downstream conditions.\n",

However, at the ejecta phase of an interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejection (ICME) event, the Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number may experience a\nsignificant reduction due to the intensified interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) strength and decreased density. On 24 April 2023, an ICME reached Earth's\norbit. The solar wind density dropped to as low as 0.3 amu/cc while the IMF\nstrength is about 25 nT. As a result, the solar wind flow transitions to a\nsub-Alfv\\'{e}nic state with an Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number of 0.4, providing\nopportunities to investigate the interaction of planetary magnetospheres with\nlow Mach number solar wind. We carry out global simulations to investigate the\nresponses of Earth's magnetosphere to the sub-Alfv\\'{e}nic ICME ejecta. The\nglobal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation results show the formation of\nAlfv\\'{e}n wings as the solar wind becomes sub-Alfv\\'{e}nic.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are among the most\nsuitable power generators for lunar applications given the abundant solar\nirradiance the lunar surface receives as a result of the lack of an atmosphere.\nHowever, the vastly different environmental conditions of the moon compared to\nthose on Earth call for special reconsiderations to the traditional PV power\noutput models used for terrestrial applications. The substantially wider range\nof temperatures on the moon combined with the absence of atmosphere implies the\nPV will operate at very different thermal conditions. Therefore, this paper\nproposes a PV power output model that determines PV cell temperature on the\nlunar surface based on lunar ambient temperature as well as solar irradiance,\nwhile also capturing these special lunar conditions. The model is based on\nthermal exchange via the three main heat transfer paths: heat radiation,\nabsorption, and convection. Moreover, four different array configurations are\npresented and compared to determine the most suitable choice based on energy\ngeneration and complexity for different locations around the moon.\n",

In the terrestrial magnetosphere, the FLC\nscattering plays an essential role in shaping the outer boundary of protons\nradiation belt, the rapid decay of ring current, and the formation of proton\nisotropic boundary (IB). However, previous studies have yet to adequately\ninvestigate the influence of FLC scattering on charged particles in the Earth's\ndayside magnetosphere, particularly in the off-equatorial magnetic minima\nregions. This study employs T89 magnetic field model to investigate the impacts\nof FLC scattering on ring current protons in the dayside magnetosphere, with a\nspecific focus on the off-equatorial minimum regions. We analyze the spatial\ndistributions of single and dual magnetic minima regions, adiabatic parameter,\nand pitch angle diffusion coefficients due to FLC scattering as functions of\n$Kp$. The results show that the effects of FLC scattering are significant not\nonly on the dusk and dawn sides but also in the off-equatorial minima regions\non the noon. Additionally, we investigate the role of dipole tilt angle in the\nhemispheric asymmetry of FLC scattering effects. The dipole tilt angle controls\nthe overall displacement of the dayside magnetosphere, resulting in different\nFLC scattering effects in the two hemispheres.

        "summary": "  In the domain of Space Situational Awareness (SSA), the challenges pertaining\nto orbit determination and catalog correlation are notably pronounced, partly\nattributable to the escalating presence of non-cooperative satellites engaging\nin unspecified maneuvers at irregular intervals. This study introduces an\ninitial orbit determination methodology reliant upon data obtained from a\nsingle surveillance radar, such as the Spanish Space Surveillance and Tracking\nSurveillance Radar (S3TSR). The need for fast algorithms within an operational\ncontext is considered here as the main design driver. The result is a\nleast-squares fitting procedure that incorporates an analytically formulated\napproximation of the dynamics under the J2 perturbation, valid for short-term\npropagation. The algorithm makes use of all available observables, including\nrange-rate, which makes it distinct from other similar methods. The method is\ncompared in a battery of synthetic tests against a classical range and angles\nfitting method (GTDS) to study the effect of the track length and density of\nmeasurements on the full state estimation. The presented methodology is quite\nversatile, and it is leveraged to improve the estimation quality by adding\ninformation of the object's orbital plane obtained from predictions. The\nresulting method has been named OPOD.\n",

Accurately predicting the radiative flux of Nitric\nOxide is crucial for understanding the thermospheric energy budget,\nparticularly during extreme space weather events. With advancements in\ncomputational techniques, machine learning (ML) has become a highly effective\ntool for space weather forecasting. This effort becomes even more worthwhile\nconsidering the availability of two decades of continuous NO infrared emissions\nmeasurement by TIMED/SABER along with several other key thermospheric\nvariables. We present the scheme of development of an ML-based predictive model\nfor Nitric Oxide Infrared Radiative Flux (NOIRF).

By\nanalyzing latitudinal changes over quiet times for each month in year 2018, it\nis evident that both the investigative parameters exhibit summer-winter\nvariability. The qualitative contribution of different species (i.e., NO, and\nO), and temperatures in determining the vertical profile of NO radiative\ncooling for different latitudes is investigated by utilizing the NRLMSISE-00\nestimated parameters, and SNOE observed NO density. The temperature, NO\ndensity, meridional wind, and associated compositional variations due to\nasymmetrical solar heating in both the hemispheres during solar minimum\nconditions seem to be the dominating factor in controlling the NO radiative\ncooling during different seasons. The altitudes at which maximum cooling by NO\noccurs exhibits an inverse correlation with the amount of radiative cooling.\nThe region of enhanced NO densities (polar and summer hemispheric low-mid\nlatitude regions) have larger NO radiative cooling with lower peak altitudes in\ncomparison to other regions (equatorial to winter hemispheric low-mid latitude\nregions), where NO radiative cooling is low with higher peak altitude values.\n",

        "summary": "  Interplanetary shocks are one of the crucial dynamic phenomena in the\nHeliosphere. They can accelerate particles to high energies, generate plasma\nwaves, and can trigger geomagnetic storms in Earth's magnetosphere,\nsignificantly impacting technological infrastructure. In this study, two IP\nshock events are selected to study the temporal variations of the shock\nparameters using magnetometer and ion plasma measurements of the STEREO$-$A and\nB, the Wind, Cluster fleet, and the ACE spacecraft. The shock normal vectors\nare determined using the minimum variance analysis (MVA) and the magnetic\ncoplanarity methods. During the May 7, 2007, event, the shock parameters and\nthe shock normal direction remain consistent across each spacecraft crossing of\nthe shock. The shock surface appears to be tilted almost the same degree as the\nParker spiral, and the driver could be a Co$-$rotating Interaction Region\n(CIR). During the April 23, 2007 event, the shock parameters do not change\nsignificantly except for the shock angle $\\theta_{B_{n}}$, however, the shape\nof the IP shock appears to be twisted along the perpendicular direction to the\nSun-Earth line as well. The driver of this rippled shock is Stream Interaction\nRegion (SIR)/CIR as well.\n",

        "summary": "  Magnetic field fluctuations measured in the heliosheath by the Voyager\nspacecraft are often characterized as compressible, as indicated by a strong\nfluctuating component parallel to the mean magnetic field. However, the\ninterpretation of the turbulence data faces the caveat that the standard Taylor\nhypothesis is invalid because the solar wind flow velocity in the heliosheath\nbecomes subsonic and slower than the fast magnetosonic speed, given the\ncontributions from hot pickup ions in the heliosheath. We attempt to overcome\nthis caveat by introducing a 4D frequency wavenumber spectral modeling of\nturbulence, which is essentially a decomposition of different wave modes\nfollowing their respective dispersion relations. Isotropic Alfven and fast mode\nturbulence are considered to represent the heliosheath fluctuations. We also\ninclude two dispersive fast wave modes derived from a three-fluid theory. We\nfind that (1) magnetic fluctuations in the inner heliosheath are less\ncompressible than previously thought. An isotropic turbulence spectral model\nwith about 1/4 in compressible fluctuation power is consistent with the\nobserved magnetic compressibility in the heliosheath; (2) the hot pickup ion\ncomponent and the relatively cold solar wind ions induce two dispersive fast\nmagnetosonic wave branches in the perpendicular propagation limit. Pickup ion\nfast wave may account for the spectral bump near the proton gyrofrequency in\nthe observable spectrum; (3) it is possible that the turbulence wavenumber\nspectrum is not Kolmogorov-like although the observed frequency spectrum has a\n-5/3 power law index, depending on the partitioning of power among the various\nwave modes, and this partitioning may change with wavenumber.\n",

Our findings show that (1) the enhancement of the whistler\nwave occurrence rate and wave amplitudes observed between 25-35 RS is\npredominantly due to the sunward propagating whistler waves population\nassociated with the switchback-related magnetic dips; (2) the anti-sunward or\ncounter-propagating cases are observed at 30-40 RS; (3) between 40-50 RS,\nsunward and anti-sunward whistlers are observed with comparable occurrence\nrates; and (4) almost no sunward or counter-propagating whistlers were observed\nat heliocentric distances above 50 RS.\n",

Although there are only a few studies on the\nseasonal variation are available in the literature, the impact of ICME on 557.7\nnm dayglow emission has not been investigated so far. Using the instruments\naboard ExoMars-TGO and MAVEN spacecrafts, we show that the primary emission\npeak (75-80 km) remains unaffected during the ICME event compared to\nquiet-times. However, a noticeable enhancement has been observed in the\nbrightness of secondary emission peak (110-120 km) and the upper altitude\nregion (140-180 km). The enhancement is attributed to the increased solar\nelectrons and X-ray fluxes, augmenting the electron-impact process and causing\nthe enhancement in the brightness. These analyses have an implication to\ncomprehend the role of intense solar transients like ICME on the Martian\ndayglow emissions.\n",

Chorus has also been believed to be governed by planetary\nmagnetic dipolar fields5,7. Contrary to such conventional expectation, here we\nreport unexpected observations of chorus in the terrestrial neutral sheet where\nmagnetic dipolar effect is absent. Using unprecedentedly high-cadence data from\nthe Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission, we present the first, ultrafast\nmeasurements of the wave dispersion relation and electron three-dimensional\ndistributions within the waves, showing smoking-gun evidences for\nchorus-electron interactions and development of electron holes in the wave\nphase space. We estimate field-particle energy transfer inside the waves and\nfind that the waves were extracting energy from local thermal electrons, in\nline with the wave positive growth rate derived from instability analysis. Our\nobservations, opening new pathways for resolving long-standing controversies\nregarding the chorus emissions, are crucial for understanding nonlinear energy\ntransport ubiquitously observed in space and astrophysical environments.\n",

This study presents a low-cost, low-mass, and low-power\nsolution for high-fidelity analysis of electron precipitation events by\nmeasuring the resulting bremsstrahlung X-ray emissions. Specifically, we report\non results from the flight of a radiation detector payload based on a silicon\npixel read-out Timepix detector technology, and its successful utilization\nonboard a `burster' weather balloon. We launched this payload during the May\n2024 superstorm, capturing high-resolution measurements of both background\ngalactic cosmic ray radiation as well as storm-time energetic electron\nprecipitation. We further developed particle and radiation detection algorithms\nto separate bremsstrahlung X-rays from other particle species in the\npixel-resolved trajectories as seen in the Timepix detector. The measurements\nrevealed a distinctive four-peak structure in X-ray flux, corresponding to\nperiodic four-minute-long bursts of energetic electron precipitation between\n21:20 and 21:40 UT. This precipitation was also observed by a riometer station\nclose to the balloon launch path, further validating balloon measurements and\nthe developed X-ray identification algorithm. The clear periodic structure of\nthe measured precipitation is likely caused by modulation of the electron\nlosses from the radiation belt by harmonic Pc5 ULF waves, observed\ncontemporaneously on the ground. The study underscores the potential of\ncompact, low-cost payloads for advancing our understanding of space weather.\nSpecifically, we envision a potential use of such Timepix-based detectors in\nspace science, for example on sounding rockets or nano-, micro-, and small\nsatellite platforms.\n",

This\ninteraction results in ionosphere structuring and variability that pose major\nchallenges for accurate ionosphere prediction for global navigation satellite\nsystem (GNSS) related applications and space weather research. The ionospheric\nstructuring and variability are often probed using the total electron content\n(TEC) and its relative perturbations (dTEC). Among dTEC variations observed at\nhigh latitudes, a unique modulation pattern has been linked to magnetospheric\nultra low frequency (ULF) waves, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\nHere using magnetically-conjugate observations from the THEMIS spacecraft and a\nground-based GPS receiver at Fairbanks, Alaska, we provide direct evidence that\nthese dTEC modulations are driven by magnetospheric electron precipitation\ninduced by ULF-modulated whistler-mode waves. We observed peak-to-peak dTEC\namplitudes reaching ~0.5 TECU (1 TECU is equal to 10$^6$ electrons/m$^2$) with\nmodulations spanning scales of ~5--100 km. The cross-correlation between our\nmodeled and observed dTEC reached ~0.8 during the conjugacy period but\ndecreased outside of it. The spectra of whistler-mode waves and dTEC also\nmatched closely at ULF frequencies during the conjugacy period but diverged\noutside of it. Our findings elucidate the high-latitude dTEC generation from\nmagnetospheric wave-induced precipitation, addressing a significant gap in\ncurrent physics-based dTEC modeling. Theses results thus improve ionospheric\ndTEC prediction and enhance our understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling via ULF waves.\n",

On the other hand,\ntheoretical studies, based on global numerical simulations, have not yet\ninvestigated the global 3D interaction between a turbulent solar wind and a\nplanetary magnetosphere. This paper addresses this gap for the first time by\ninvestigating the global dynamics of this interaction, providing new\nperspectives on the underlying physical processes. We examine how the turbulent\nnature of the solar wind influences the 3D structure and dynamics of magnetized\nplanetary environments or magnetized Earth-like exoplanets, using the newly\ndeveloped numerical code Menura. We use the hybrid PIC model Menura to conduct\n3D simulations of the turbulent solar wind and its interaction with an\nEarth-like magnetized planet through global numerical simulations of the\nmagnetosphere and its surroundings. We show that solar wind turbulence globally\ninfluences the shape and dynamics of the bow shock, the magnetosheath\nstructures, and the ion foreshock dynamics. We show that a turbulent solar wind\ndisrupts the coherence of foreshock fluctuations, induces large fluctuations on\nthe quasi-perpendicular surface of the bow shock, facilitates the formation of\nbubble-like structures near the bow shock's nose, and modifies the properties\nof the magnetosheath region. None of these phenomena occur when comparing with\nthe case in which the solar wind is laminar. The turbulent nature of the solar\nwind impacts the 3D shape and dynamics of the bow shock, magnetosheath, and ion\nforeshock region. This influence should be considered when studying solar\nwind-planet interactions in observations and simulations.

In this study, we aim to\nanalyze how the footpoint locations are impacted by the inputs parameters of\nthese models, including solar wind conditions, geomagnetic activity, and the\nlocation in the magnetotail. A dataset of 2394 bursty bulk flows (BBFs)\ndetected by MMS was mapped to Earth's ionosphere with four different Tsyganenko\nmodels. The MLT position showed a variability of approximately +/-1 MLT across\nthe models. Footpoint locations were linked to the dawn-dusk position of the\nBBFs, with differences between models associated with variations in the\ninterplanetary magnetic field clock angle. The MLAT values exhibited greater\nvariability of approximately +/-2{\\deg} around the mean value, with a\nsystematic shift toward higher latitudes observed in two of the four models.\nThis position is also influenced by the the input parameter of the model\nrepresenting the dynamics of Earth's magnetosphere, with larger values\ncorresponding to lower latitudes.

In the present study, on a moderately geomagnetically active\nnight of 26 October 2019 (Ap=24), the airglow imager over Hanle (32.7{\\deg}N,\n78.9{\\deg}E; Mlat. ~24.1{\\deg}N), India recorded the evolution and decay of an\nEMSTID in the O(1D) 630.0 nm airglow images in between 13.3 UT and 15.8 UT.

The most important\naspect of the event was the occurrence of the two consecutive substorms in\nbetween 13.3 UT and 15.8 UT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of\nits kind study where we report the role of interplanetary electric field (IEF)\nand substorm induced electric fields on the evolution and decay of the EMSTID.\nThis study elicits effects of the externally imposed electric fields on the\nmid-latitude ionospheric plasma structures and provides insight into the\ncomplex coupling between auroral and low-mid latitude region.\n",

By examining Two-Line Element\ndata, we observed a significant increase in orbital decay following the\ngeomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024, consistent with expectations of increased\nthermospheric density. An unexpected increase in decay rates for 10 satellites\nwas identified around 25 April 2024, while two lower-altitude satellites\nremained unaffected. Detailed analysis revealed that this enhanced decay rate\nprior to the storm was influenced by a spike in the O/N2 ratio and an increase\nin Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) flux. Moreover, most of the satellites exhibited\nsharp decay during the early recovery phase of the geomagnetic storm. Based on\nthe positions and local times of changes in decay rates, it is likely that the\nsatellites were affected by various processes during elevated space weather\nactivity, such as enhanced EUV flux, Joule heating, particle precipitation, and\nthe equatorial neutral anomaly. This study highlights the complex role of\npreconditioning due to enhanced EUV flux and extreme space weather activity in\nthe orbital dynamics of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.\n",

One consequence of this energy release is\nheating of thermal electrons and acceleration of energetic (non-thermal)\nelectrons. The upper-energy limit as well as the spatial scale size of the\nelectron acceleration regions remain mysteries in magnetotail physics because\ncurrent missions can effectively only offer us a single-point glimpse into the\nnumerous magnetotail phenomena ranging from electron- to global-scales. These\nenergetic electrons can provide a significant source of seed electrons for the\nVan Allen Radiation belts. Here we use a unique approach to study relativistic\nplasma sheet electron acceleration. We combine high-altitude Magnetospheric\nMultiscale (MMS) mission observations with low-altitude Electron Losses and\nFields Investigation (ELFIN) observations, to quantify the upper-energy extent\nand radial scale of a burst of plasma sheet electrons that mapped to 33 Earth\nradii. The plasma sheet locally accelerated an intense mesoscale burst of 3 MeV\nelectrons -- far higher and more intense than the outer Van Allen radiation\nbelt -- and scattered them into the atmospheric loss cone. High-altitude\nobservations Earthward of the burst at 17 Earth radii showed only the usual\nsubstorm activity signatures -- demonstrating that this burst was 1) intense,\n2) localized to the far magnetotail, and 3) likely accelerated by a very\nefficient and rapid mechanism.\n",

The super epoch analysis was\ncarried out to determine the general response of L-shell, pitch angle, and\nenergy-dependency of relativistic electrons to HILDCAAs. The analysis reveals a\nsignificant flux enhancement in the relativistic electron fluxes, predominantly\noccurring with a delay of 0 to 2 days following the onset of HILDCAA events.\nThe general response indicates that the maximum energy of accelerated electrons\nreaches up to 6 MeV. Additionally, electrons with perpendicular pitch angles\nexhibit a significantly greater enhancement in flux and achieve higher maximum\nacceleration energies compared to those with parallel pitch angles. The\nobserved time-delayed and pitch angle-dependent response related to the onset\nof HILDCAAs highlights the significant influence of wave-particle interactions,\nparticularly in relation to ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves in this context.\nThis is further supported by ground-based magnetometers and in-situ magnetic\nfield observations from the RBSP probe, which demonstrated enhanced power of\nULF waves during HILDCAA events.

Instead, it is possible that\nthe increased EUV flux at this time rather caused it to expand in size. Key\nfindings also include the identification of several far downstream bow shock\n(BS), or bow wave, crossings to at least 60 Rv (1 Rv = 6,052 km is the radius\nof Venus), and the induced magnetospheric boundary to at least 20 Rv.

By looking at a preliminary version of the Dst index\nand altitudes along with velocities extracted from two-line element (TLE) data\nof the Starlink-1089 (SL-1089) satellite, we observe a possible connection\nbetween storm main phase onset and a sharp decay of SL-1089.

The sharp altitude decay of SL-1089 revealed by TLE data\ncoincides with the storm main phase onset. We compare the de-orbiting altitudes\nof another three satellites during different geomagnetic conditions and observe\nthat the day difference between actual and predicted reentries increases for\nperiods with higher geomagnetic activity. Therefore, we call for future\nresearch to establish the eventual causal relationship between storm occurrence\nand satellite orbital decay.

Predicted arrival times and velocities\nfrom these models are compared with actual observations at the Sun-Earth L1\npoint.

The simulations\naccurately predicted arrival times with a discrepancy of approximately 5 hours\nor less for these CMEs. Further, the ensemble study of DBM shows the\nsensitivity of the CME arrival time to the background solar wind speed and drag\nparameters. All three models have done fairly well in reproducing the arrival\ntime closely to the actual observation of the CMEs responsible for the extreme\ngeomagnetic storm of May 10, 2024.

These structures come in different sizes, from\nmagnetohydrodynamic to kinetic scales. Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)\nobservations have revealed electron scale MHs to be ubiquitous in the turbulent\nEarth's magnetosheath, potentially playing an important role in the energy\ncascade and dissipation. Despite abundant observations, the origin of electron\nscale MHs is still unclear and debated. In this work, we use fully kinetic\nsimulations to investigate the role of plasma turbulence in generating electron\nscale MHs. We perform a fully kinetic simulation of freely decaying plasma\nturbulence, initialized with typical Earth's magnetosheath parameters. We find\nthat electron scale MHs can be generated by turbulence via the following\nmechanism: first, large-scale turbulent velocity shears produce regions with\nhigh electron temperature anisotropy; these localized regions become unstable,\ngenerating oblique electron scale whistler waves; as they propagate over the\ninhomogeneous turbulent background, whistler fluctuations develop an\nelectrostatic component, turning into Bernstein-like modes; the strong\nelectrostatic fluctuations produce current filaments that merge into an\nelectron scale current vortex; the resulting electron vortex locally reduces\nthe magnetic field amplitude, finally evolving into an electron scale MH. We\nshow that MHs generated by this mechanism have properties consistent with MMS\nobservations and nontrivial kinetic features. We provide numerical evidence of\na new electron scale MH generation mechanism, driven by turbulence. Our results\nhave potential implications for understanding the formation and occurrence of\nelectron scale MHs in turbulent environments, such as the Earth's\nmagnetosheath.\n",

To describe behaviour\nof functions defined on multifractal sets the generalizations of the fractional\nRiemann-Liouville derivatives $D_{t}^{d(t)}$ are introduced with the order of\ndifferentiation (depending on time and coordinate) being equal the value of\nfractional dimension. For $d_{t}=const$ the generalized fractional derivatives\n(GFD) reduce to ordinary Riemann-Liouville integral functionals, and when\n$d_{t}$ is close to integer, GFD can be represented by means of derivatives of\ninteger order. For time and space with fractional dimensions a method to\ninvestigate the generalized equations of theoretical physics by means of GFD is\nproposed. The Euler equations defined on multifractal sets of time and space\nare obtained using the principle of the minimum of FD functionals.

The basic astrometric observable of the\ninstrument is the pathlength delay, a measurement made by a combination of\ninternal metrology measurements that determine the distance the starlight\ntravels through the two arms of the interferometer and a measurement of the\nwhite light stellar fringe to find the point of equal pathlength. Because this\noperation requires a non--negligible integration time to accurately measure the\nstellar fringe position, the interferometer baseline vector is not stationary\nover this time period, as its absolute length and orientation are\ntime--varying. This conflicts with the consistency condition necessary for\nextracting the astrometric parameters which requires a stationary baseline\nvector.

This implies that great care should be exercised before concluding that\nmagnetospheric reconnection is antiparallel. We also find that even for such\nweak guide fields strong inward-flowing electron beams form in the vicinity of\nthe magnetic separatrices and Buneman-unstable distribution functions arise at\nthe x-line itself.

All previous attempts failed to measure the absorption of\ncarbonado-diamond in the most important IR-range of 1000-1300 cm-1 (10.00-7.69\nmicro-m.) because of silica inclusions. In our investigation, KBr pellets were\nmade from crushed silica-free carbonado-diamond and thin sections were also\nprepared. The 100 to 1000 times brighter synchrotron infrared radiation permits\na greater spatial resolution. Inclusions and pore spaces were avoided and/or\nsources of chemical contamination were removed. The FTIR spectra of\ncarbonado-diamond mostly depict the presence of single nitrogen impurities, and\nhydrogen. The lack of identifiable nitrogen aggregates in the infrared spectra,\nthe presence of features related to hydrocarbon stretch bonds, and the\nresemblance of the spectra to CVD and presolar diamonds indicate that\ncarbonado-diamonds formed in a hydrogen-rich interstellar environment.

However, there are two errors and one mistake in their procedure: (1)\nHS used two free parameters of the direction, whereas only one can be freely\nselected, because the second is provided by SMEI data. As a result, the\ndirections determined by HS are incorrect. (2) HS overlooked that, since the\ntrajectory depends on more than one parameter, there is a broad set of\ntrajectories, for various speeds and directions, matching the event, and thus a\nbroad range of the onset times. HS select only one trajectory for each SMEI\nevent. Therefore the associations made by them are incomplete, and they should\nbe reexamined.

We compute vertical\ncomponent of tension term of Lorentz force over two active regions namely NOAA\nAR 10933 and NOAA AR 10930 observed on 05 January 2007 and 12 December 2006\nrespectively. The former is a simple while latter is a complex active region\nwith highly sheared polarity inversion line (PIL). The vector magnetograms used\nare obtained from Hinode(SOT/SP). We find an inhomogeneous distribution of\ntension with both positive and negative signs in various features of the\nsunspots. The existence of positive tension at locations of lower field\nstrength and higher inclination is compatible with the uncombed model of the\npenumbral structure. Positive tension is also seen in umbral light bridges\nwhich could be indication of uncombed structure of the light bridge. Likewise,\nthe upward directed tension associated with bipolar regions in the penumbra\ncould be a direct confirmation of the sea serpent model of penumbral\nstructures. Upward directed tension at the PIL of AR 10930 seems to be related\nto flux emergence. The magnitude of the tension force is greater than the force\nof gravity in some places, implying a nearly force-free configuration for these\nsunspot features.

Spectra were obtained with VLT/ISAAC for the\nslit both perpendicular and parallel to the flow to examine jet kinematics and\ngas physics within the first arcsecond from the star. The jet was successfully\ndetected in both molecular and atomic lines. The H_2 component was found to be\nentirely blueshifted around the base of the bipolar jet. It shows that only the\nblue lobe is emitting in H_2 while light is scattered in the direction of the\nred lobe, highlighting an asymmetric extinction and/or excitation between the\ntwo lobes. Consistent with this view, the red lobe is brighter in all atomic\nlines. Interestingly, the jet was detected not only in [Fe II], but also in Br\ngamma and Pa beta lines. Though considered tracers mainly of accretion, we find\nthat these high excitation hydrogen permitted lines trace the jet as far as 150\nAU from the star. This is confirmed in a number of ways: the presence of the\n[Fe II] 2.13 micron line which is of similarly high excitation; H I velocities\nwhich match the jet [Fe II] velocities in both the blue and red lobe; and high\nelectron density close to the source of >6x10^4 cm^-3 derived from the [Fe II]\n1.64,1.60 micron ratio. These near-infrared data complement HST/STIS optical\nand near-ultraviolet data for the same target which were used in a jet rotation\nstudy, although no rotation signature could be identified here due to\ninsufficient angular resolution. The unpublished HST/STIS H alpha emission is\nincluded here along side the other H I lines. Identifying Br gamma and Pa beta\nas tracers of ejection is significant because of the importance of finding\nstrong near-infrared probes close to the star, where forbidden lines are\nquenched, which will help understand accretion-ejection when observed with high\nspatial resolution instruments such as VLTI/AMBER.\n",

One\nconsequence is that the ODP will generate Doppler residuals, the difference\nbetween the actual trajectory and the predicted trajectory which show an\nanomalous force. When this effect is integrated in long arc solutions, it can\ngrow to considerable magnitude.

These differences lead to lack of\ncorrespondence between simulations of the IMF behaviour at 1 AU and\nobservations. Our results indicate that picture of the IMF expansion into space\nis more complicated than usually considered, and the sector structure is not\nthe only source of the two-humped shape of the in-ecliptic or radial IMF\ncomponent. We have analysed data from different spacecraft at the distances\nfrom 0.29 AU to 4 AU and found that the shape of the radial IMF component\ndistribution strongly depends on a heliocentric distance and a heliolatitude.\nThe \"two-humped IMF\" effect is most brightly expressed at low heliolatitudes at\n0.7-2 AU, but it fully disappears at 3-4 AU. There is also dependence of the\nIMF distributions' view on a solar cycle due to active processes, such as solar\nflares and CMEs. We suppose that the in-ecliptic solar wind field at 1 AU is\ninfluenced by solar active regions in a high degree, and actually the\ndistribution is the three-humped: two humps correspond to the IMF from the\nmiddle and high heliolatitudes and the third one is the theoretically expected\ndistribution from the solar field nearby the heliomagnetic equator. Vanishing\nof the IMF zero-component with the distance from the Sun partially could be a\nresult of a magnetic reconnection at the current sheets in the solar wind.\n",

        "summary": "  Our main goal is to derive a new extinction map of the OMC-1, obtaining\ninformation about the structure of the OMC-1 and the Orion Nebula Cluster. The\nmost recent near-infrared catalog of stars is used to study the distribution of\nreddening across a ~0.3 deg^2 area covering the Orion Nebula Cluster. On the\nbasis of the observed (H,H-K_S) diagram, we establish a criterion for\ndisentangling contaminants from bona-fide cluster members. For contaminant\nstars, interstellar reddenings are estimated by comparison with a synthetic\ngalactic model. A statistical analysis is then performed to consistently\naccount for local extinction, reddening and star-counts analysis. We derive the\nextinction map of the OMC-1 with angular resolution <5'. We also assemble a\nsample of candidate cluster members, for which we measure the extinction\nprovided by the nebular environment. These extinction measurements are analyzed\nsimilarly to the contaminant sample, and an extinction map of the Orion Nebula\nis derived. The extinction provided by the OMC-1 is variable on spatial scales\nof a few arcminutes, while showing a general increase from the outskirts\n(A_V~6) to the direction of the Trapezium asterism (A_V>30). The Orion Nebula\nextinction map is more irregular and optically thinner, with A_V of the order\nof a few magnitudes. Both maps are consistent with the optical morphology, in\nparticular the Dark Bay to the north-east of the Trapezium. Both maps also show\nthe presence of a north-south high-density ridge, which confirms the\nfilamentary structure of the Orion molecular complex inside which star\nformation is still taking place.\n",

A problem\npredicted more than thirty years ago, the threat from debris larger than about\n1 cm demands serious attention. A promising proposed solution uses a high power\npulsed laser system on the Earth to make plasma jets on the objects, slowing\nthem slightly, and causing them to re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere. In\nthis paper, we reassess this approach in light of recent advances in low-cost,\nlight-weight modular design for large mirrors, calculations of laser-induced\norbit changes and in design of repetitive, multi-kilojoule lasers, that build\non inertial fusion research. These advances now suggest that laser orbital\ndebris removal (LODR) is the most cost-effective way to mitigate the debris\nproblem. No other solutions have been proposed that address the whole problem\nof large and small debris. A LODR system will have multiple uses beyond debris\nremoval. International cooperation will be essential for building and operating\nsuch a system.\n",

This conclusion is based on the fact that the low energy\n6-14 MeV galactic electron intensity suddenly increased by ~20% over a time\nperiod \\leg 10 days and the electron radial intensity gradient abruptly\ndecreased from ~19%/AU to ~8%/AU at 2009.7 at a radial distance of 111.2 AU. A\nsudden radial gradient change was also observed at this time for >200 MeV\nprotons. The gradients were constant during the time period before and after\nthe electron increase. At about 2011.2 at a distance of 116.6 AU a second\nabrupt intensity increase was observed, this time for both electrons and\nprotons. The increase for electrons was ~25% and occurred over a time period\n~15 days or less. For >200 MeV protons the increase at this time was ~5%\n(unusually large) and occurred over a longer time period ~50 days. Between\nabout 2011.2 and 2011.6, radial intensity gradients ~18%/AU and 3%/AU were\nobserved for electrons and protons, respectively. These gradients were very\nsimilar to those observed for these particles before the 1st sudden increase at\n2009.7. These large positive gradients observed after 2011.2 indicate that V1,\nalthough it has entered a different propagation region, is still within the\noverall heliospheric modulating region at least up to a time ~2011.6 (118.0\nAU). In this paper we will discuss these events in more detail and consider\npossibilities for their explanation that have recently been suggested.\n",

This\ntechnique was successful in detecting and characterizing many medium-scale\ntraveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) seen intermittently throughout the\nnight and has been partially validated using concurrent GPS measurements.\nSmaller waves are also seen with this technique at nearly all times, many of\nwhich move in similar directions as the detected MSTIDs. The second technique\nallows for the detection and statistical description of the properties of\ngroups of waves moving in similar directions with wavelengths as small as 5 km.\nCombining the results of both spectral techniques, we found a class of\nintermediate and small scale waves which are likely the quasi-periodic (QP)\nechoes that have been observed to occur within sporadic-E (Es) layers. We find\ntwo distinct populations of these waves. The members of one population are\ncoincident in time with MSTIDs and are consistent with being generated within\nEs layers by the E-F coupling instability.

However further X-ray\nobservations by the Suzaku and XMM-Newton satellites did not confirm this\nperiodicity but show a very peculiar variability, including moderate repetitive\nflares and numerous absorption dips. These characteristics together with a\nsuspected 4.3 h orbital period would suggest a possible link with the so-\ncalled \"dipping sources\", a sub-class of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB). Based\non the released FERMI catalogues, the source was also found coincident with a\nvery high energy (0.1-300 GeV) VHE source 2FGL J1227.7-4853. The good\npositional coincidence, together with the lack of any other bright X-ray\nsources in the field, makes this identification highly probable. However, none\nof the other standard LMXBs have been so far detected by FERMI. Most galactic\nVHE sources are associated with rotation-powered pulsars. We present here new\nresults obtained from a 30 ksec high-time resolution XMM observations in\nJanuary 2011 that confirm the flaring-dipping behaviour and provide upper\nlimits on fast X-ray pulsations.

In this way electron holes\ngenerate magnetic fields in the hole. We solve the cylindrical hole model\nexactly for the hole charge, electric potential and magnetic field. In electron\nholes, the magnetic field is amplified on the flux tube of the hole;\nequivalently, in ion holes the field would be decreased. The flux tube adjacent\nto the electron hole is magnetically depleted by the external hole dipole\nfield. This causes magnetic filamentation. It is also shown that holes are\nmassive objects, each carrying a finite magnetic moment. Binary magnetic dipole\ninteraction of these moments will cause alignment of the holes into chains\nalong the magnetic field or, in the three-dimensional case, produce a magnetic\nfabric in the volume of hole formation. Since holes, in addition to being\ncarriers of charges and magnetic moments, also have finite masses, they behave\nlike quasi-particles, performing ExB, magnetic field, and diamagnetic drifts.\nIn an inhomogeneous magnetic field, their magnetic moments experience torque\nwhich causes nutation of the hole around the direction of the magnetic field\npresumably giving rise to low frequency magnetic modulations like pulsations. A\ngas of many such holes may allow for a kinetic description in which holes\nundergo binary dipole interactions.

This approach allows us to comment on the significance of the ions'\ngyrophase at the moment charge exchange occurs.

The correlation coefficient of electron flux\nvariations in parallel and antiparallel directions is always around 0.8. The\nsimilar behavior of flux variations in BL and RE suggests that reconnection may\ncommonly occur in BL. Our work also implies that the strong energy dependence\nand direction selectivity of electron flux variations, which are previously\nthought to have no enough relevance to magnetic reconnection, could be\nconsidered as an important signature of solar wind reconnection in the\nstatistical point of view.\n",

This analysis is made\npossible due to recent advances in multispacecraft data interpolation,\nreconstruction, and visualization as well as results from recent modeling of\nionic charge states in MHD simulations of magnetic breakout and flux\ncancellation CME initiation. We use these advances to interpret specific\nfeatures of the ICME plasma composition resulting from the magnetic topology\nand evolution of the CME. We find that in both the data and our MHD\nsimulations, the flux ropes centers are relatively cool, while charge state\nenhancements surround and trail the flux ropes. The magnetic orientation of the\nICMEs are suggestive of magnetic breakout-like reconnection during the eruption\nprocess, which could explain the spatial location of the observed iron\nenhancements just outside the traditional flux rope magnetic signatures and\nbetween the two ICMEs. Detailed comparisons between the simulations and data\nwere more complicated, but a sharp increase in high iron charge states in the\nACE and STEREO-A data during the second flux rope corresponds well to similar\nfeatures in the flux cancellation results.

We derive the CME kinematics, including the evolution of the\nCME expansion until 0.4 AU.

STEREO observes a complex structure composed of\ntwo different bright tracks in HI2-A but only one bright track in HI2-B. In\nsitu measurements from Wind show an \"isolated\" ICME, with the geometry of a\nflux rope preceded by a shock. Measurements in the sheath are consistent with\ndraping around the transient. By combining remote-sensing and in situ\nmeasurements, we determine that this event shows a clear instance of deflection\nof two CMEs after their collision, and we estimate the deflection of the first\nCME to be about 10 degrees towards the Sun-Earth line. The arrival time,\narrival speed and radius at Earth of the first CME are best predicted from\nremote-sensing observations taken before the collision of the CMEs. Due to the\nover-expansion of the CME after the collision, there are few, if any, signs of\ninteraction in in situ measurements.

The experimental information have been\ncollected in the OMNI Web/NSSDC data set of hourly averaged heliospheric\nparameters for last four solar cycles from 20th to 23rd. We studied statistical\ncharacteristics of such key heliospheric parameters as solar wind proton number\ndensity, temperature, bulk velocity, and IMF vector as well as dimensionless\nparameters.

In this method\nobservations from heliospheric images are constrained with in-situ plasma and\nfield data at 1 AU. These data are used to convert measured ICME elongations\ninto distance by applying the Harmonic Mean approach that assumes a spherical\nshape of the ICME front. We use synthetic white-light images, similar as\nobserved by STEREO-A/HI, for three different separation angles between remote\nand in-situ spacecraft, of 30{\\deg}, 60{\\deg}, and 90{\\deg}. To validate the\nresults of the method they are compared to the apex speed profile of the\nmodeled ICME, as obtained from a top view. This profile reflects the \"true\"\napex kinematics since it is not affected by scattering or projection effects.\nIn this way it is possible to determine the accuracy of the method for\nrevealing ICME propagation directions and kinematics. We found that the\ndirection obtained by the constrained Harmonic Mean method is not very\nsensitive to the separation angle (30{\\deg} sep: \\phi = W7; 60{\\deg} sep: \\phi\n= W12; 90{\\deg} sep: \\phi = W15; true dir.: E0/W0). For all three cases the\nderived kinematics are in a relatively good agreement with the real kinematics.\nThe best consistency is obtained for the 30{\\deg} case, while with growing\nseparation angle the ICME speed at 1 AU is increasingly overestimated (30{\\deg}\nsep: \\Delta V_arr ~-50 km/s, 60{\\deg} sep: \\Delta V_arr ~+75 km/s, 90{\\deg}\nsep: \\Delta V_arr ~+125 km/s).

These spectra had\nintensity peaks in the range of 30-60 MeV, decreasing at both lower energies\ndown to a few MeV and at higher energies up to several hundred MeV. We have\nmodeled the propagation of these particles in the galaxy using an updated Leaky\nBox Diffusion model which determines the spectra of these components from ~2\nMeV to >200 GeV. The key parameters used in the model are a galactic input\nspectrum ~P^-2.24, the same for all components and independent of rigidity, and\na diffusion coefficient that is ~P^0.5 above a lower rigidity and increases\n~beta^-1.0 below a lower rigidity ~0.56 GV. These same parameters also fit the\nhigh energy H and He data from ~10-200 GeV/nuc from the PAMELA and BESS\nexperiments. The new Voyager spectra for all three nuclei are thus consistent\nwith rigidity spectra ~P^-2.24 from the lowest energies to at least 100 GeV.\nDeviations from this spectrum can reasonably be attributed to propagation\neffects. Some deviations between the calculated and newly observed spectra are\nnoted, however, below ~30 MeV/nuc, particularly for C/O nuclei, that could be\nsignificant regarding the propagation and sources of these particles.\n",

        "summary": "  We present results from a Monte Carlo simulation of a parallel collisionless\nshock undergoing particle acceleration. Our simulation, which contains\nparameterized scattering and a particular thermal leakage injection model,\ncalculates the feedback between accelerated particles ahead of the shock, which\ninfluence the shock precursor and \"smooth\" the shock, and thermal particle\ninjection. We show that there is a transition between nonrelativistic shocks,\nwhere the acceleration efficiency can be extremely high and the nonlinear\ncompression ratio can be substantially greater than the Rankine-Hugoniot value,\nand fully relativistic shocks, where diffusive shock acceleration is less\nefficient and the compression ratio remains at the Rankine-Hugoniot value. This\ntransition occurs in the trans-relativistic regime and, for the particular\nparameters we use, occurs around a shock Lorentz factor = 1.5. We also find\nthat nonlinear shock smoothing dramatically reduces the acceleration efficiency\npresumed to occur with large-angle scattering in ultra-relativistic shocks. Our\nability to seamlessly treat the transition from ultra-relativistic to\ntrans-relativistic to nonrelativistic shocks may be important for evolving\nrelativistic systems, such as gamma-ray bursts and type Ibc supernovae. We\nexpect a substantial evolution of shock accelerated spectra during this\ntransition from soft early on to much harder when the blast-wave shock becomes\nnonrelativistic.\n",

Using a Monte Carlo diffusion\nmodel with a source spectrum with a single spectral index of -2.2 at all\nenergies we are able to fit this observed Voyager spectrum and the contemporary\nPAMELA electron spectrum over an energy range from 6 MeV to ~200 GeV. This\nspectrum has a break in it but this break is due to propagation effects, not\nchanges in the primary spectrum. This break is gradual, starting at > 2 GeV\nwhere the spectrum is ~E^-3.2 and continuing down to ~100 MeV or below where\nthe spectrum becomes ~E^-1.5. At the higher energies the loss terms due to\nsynchrotron radiation and inverse Compton effects which are ~E^2.0 steepen the\nexponent of the source spectrum by 1.0. At lower energies, these terms become\nunimportant and the loss is governed by diffusion and escape from the galaxy. A\ndiffusion term which is proportional to beta^-1 below ~0.32 GV (which also fit\nthe H and He spectra measured at Voyager) and has a value = 3x1028 cm^2 x s^-1\nat 1 GV and a boundary at +/-1 Kpc will fit the Voyager or other similar\nspectra at low energies.\n",

We focus on the\neffect of the orientation of the CMEs relative to each other by performing four\ndifferent simulations with the axis of the second CME rotated by 90 degrees\nfrom one simulation to the next. Each magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation is\nperformed in three dimensions (3-D) with the Space Weather Modeling Framework\n(SWMF) in an idealized setting reminiscent of solar minimum conditions. We\nextract synthetic satellite measurements during and after the interaction and\ncompare the different cases. We also analyze the kinematics of the two CMEs,\nincluding the evolution of their widths and aspect ratios. We find that the\nfirst CME contracts radially as a result of the interaction in all cases, but\nthe amount of subsequent radial expansion depends on the relative orientation\nof the two CMEs. Reconnection between the two ejecta and between the ejecta and\nthe interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) determines the type of structure\nresulting from the interaction. When a CME with a high inclination with respect\nto the ecliptic overtakes one with a low inclination, it is possible to create\na compound event with a smooth rotation in the magnetic field vector over more\nthan 180 degrees. Due to reconnection, the second CME only appears as an\nextended \"tail\", and the event may be mistaken for a glancing encounter with an\nisolated CME. This configuration differs significantly from the one usually\nstudied of a multiple-magnetic cloud event, which we found to be associated\nwith the interaction of two CMEs with the same orientation.\n",

In particular, we assess how it influences the speed and\nshape of CMEs and under what conditions the flux rope ejection becomes a CME or\nwhen it is quenched. We ran a set of MHD simulations that adopt an eruptive\ninitial magnetic configuration that has already been shown to be suitable for a\nflux rope ejection. We varied the temperature of the backgroud corona and the\nintensity of the initial magnetic field to tune the gravitational\nstratification and the amount of ejected magnetic flux. We used an automatic\ntechnique to track the expansion and the propagation of the magnetic flux rope\nin the MHD simulations. From the analysis of the parameter space, we evaluate\nthe role of gravitational stratification on the CME speed and expansion. Our\nstudy shows that gravitational stratification plays a significant role in\ndetermining whether the flux rope ejection will turn into a full CME or whether\nthe magnetic flux rope will stop in the corona. The CME speed is affected by\nthe background corona where it travels faster when the corona is colder and\nwhen the initial magnetic field is more intense. The fastest CME we reproduce\nin our parameter space travels at 850 km/s. Moreover, the background\ngravitational stratification plays a role in the side expansion of the CME, and\nwe find that when the background temperature is higher, the resulting shape of\nthe CME is flattened more. Our study shows that although the initiation\nmechanisms of the CME are purely magnetic, the background coronal plasma plays\na key role in the CME propagation, and full MHD models should be applied when\none focusses especially on the production of a CME from a flux rope ejection.\n",

These sustained eruptions are expected to generate a global shell of\ndisturbed material sweeping through the heliosphere.

The transient streams interact with each\nother, which erases memory of the source and results in a large merged\ninteraction region (MIR) with a preceding shock. The MHD model predicts that\nthe shock and MIR would reach 120 AU around 2013 April 22, which agrees well\nwith the period of radio emissions and the time of a transient disturbance in\ngalactic cosmic rays detected by Voyager 1.

To this end, the Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research\n(ARMOR) tool is currently being developed. The tool's modules are described and\ntheir validation is documented. Based on the asteroid ephemeris, the tool\ncalculates the impact location probability distribution on the surface of the\nEarth (in the literature, occasionally referred to as risk corridor). NASA's\nNear Earth Object (NEO) risk list served as the source for asteroid\nephemerides. The Line of Variation (LOV) method was employed to find virtual\nimpactors. While offering a simple and fast way of identifying virtual\nimpactors, the method provides a low impactor identification rate. This is\nbecause the search space is tightly constricted to the LOV and thus excludes\nvirtual impactors located elsewhere in the asteroid position uncertainty\nregion. The method's performance was evaluated and suggestions for improvements\nare provided. Application of the tool showed that the asteroid threat is global\nin nature: impact locations were distributed widely over the Earth's surface.\nThe global asteroid risk was estimated by combining the impact location\nprobability distribution with Earth population data. The identification of high\nrisk regions lead to a discussion about the dynamics of the risk associated\nwith asteroids. The future response to an asteroid threat will depend on the\nrisk that the asteroid poses to the population. The potential applicability of\nARMOR as a decision-support tool for responding to the asteroid threat is\noutlined.\n",

The electron density profile (from 110 km to 400\nkm) retrieved from the X-band egress observation at Shanghai station, shows a\nsingle peak near 147 km with a peak density of about $2 \\times 10^4\n\\rm{cm}^{-3}$ at a solar zenith angle of 94$^{\\circ}$. As a comparison, the VEX\nradio science (VeRa) observations at New Norcia station were also examined,\nincluding S-, X-band and dual-frequency data in the ingress mode. The results\nshow that the electron density profiles retrieved from the S-band data are more\nanalogous to the dual-frequency data in the profile shape, compared with the\nX-band data. Generally, the S-band results slightly underestimate the magnitude\nof the peak density, while the X-band results overestimate that. The\ndiscrepancy in the X-band profile is probably due to the relatively larger\nunmodeled orbital errors. It is also expected that the ionopause height is\nsensitive to the solar wind dynamical pressure in high and intermediate solar\nactivities, usually in the range of 200 km - 1000 km on the dayside and much\nhigher on the nightside. Structural variations (\"bulges\" and fluctuations) can\nbe found in the electron density profiles in intermediate solar activity, which\nmay be caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere.\nConsiderable ionizations can be observed in the Venus' nightside ionosphere,\nwhich are unexpected for the Martian nightside ionosphere in most cases.\n",

Methods:\nThe instrument RAD, onboard Mars Science Laboratory's (MSL) rover Curiosity,\nmeasures a broad spectrum of energetic particles along with the radiation dose\nrate during the 253-day cruise phase as well as on the surface of Mars. With\nthese first ever measurements inside a spacecraft from Earth to Mars, RAD\nobserved the impulsive enhancement of dose rate during solar particle events as\nwell as a gradual evolution of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) induced radiation\ndose rate due to the modulation of the primary GCR flux by the solar magnetic\nfield, which correlates with long-term solar activities and heliospheric\nrotation. Results: We analyzed the dependence of the dose rate measured by RAD\non solar modulation potentials and estimated the dose rate and dose equivalent\nunder different solar modulation conditions. These estimations help us to have\napproximate predictions of the cruise radiation environment, such as the\naccumulated dose equivalent associated with future human missions to Mars.\nConclusions: The predicted dose equivalent rate during solar maximum conditions\ncould be as low as one-fourth of the current RAD cruise measurement.

We proceed from the\nassumption that the ion cyclotron waves in solar wind are experiencing\nmodulation with a characteristic period of 5 minutes under the influence of\nAlfven waves driven by photospheric motions. The theory presented in our paper\npredicts a deep frequency modulation of the ion cyclotron waves. The frequency\nmodulation is expected mainly from variations in orientation of the IMF lines.\nIn turn, the variations in orientation are caused by the Alfven waves,\npropagating from the Sun. To test the theoretical predictions we have analyzed\nrecords of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) geoelectromagnetic waves in order to\nfind the permanent quasi-monochromatic oscillations of natural origin in the\nPc1-2 frequency band (0.1-5 Hz), the carrier frequency of which varies with\ntime in a wide range. As a result we found the so-called \"serpentine emission\"\n(SE), which was observed in Antarctic at the Vostok station near the South\nGeomagnetic Pole. The permanency, range of frequencies, and the deep frequency\nmodulation of SE correspond to the qualitative properties of ion cyclotron\nwaves in the solar wind. Clearly expressed 5-minute modulation of the carrier\nfrequency is particularly important feature of the SE in the context of this\nwork. We believe that we have found non-trivial manifestation of the solar\n5-min oscillations on the Earth.\n",

In addition, the GRACE\nFollow-On mission is scheduled to be flown soon after the end of life of the\nGRACE mission in order to minimize the loss of valuable data on the Earth's\ngravity field changes. In view of the major benefits to hydrology and\noceanography, as well as to other fields, it is desirable to investigate the\nfundamental limits to monitoring the time variations in the Earth's gravity\nfield during GRACE-type missions. A simplified model is presented in this paper\nfor making estimates of the effect of differential spurious accelerations of\nthe satellites during times when four successive revolutions cross the Pacific\nOcean. The analysis approach discussed is to make use of changes in the\nsatellite separation observed during passages across low latitude regions of\nthe Pacific and of other oceans to correct for spurious accelerations of the\nsatellites. The low latitude regions of the Pacific and of other oceans are the\nextended regions where the a priori uncertainties in the time variations of the\ngeopotential heights due to mass distribution changes are known best. In\naddition, advantage can be taken of the repeated crossings of the South Pole\nand the North Pole, since the uncertainties in changes in the geopotential\nheights at the poles during the time required for four orbit revolutions are\nlikely to be small.\n",

Both of the geomagnetic storms show a multi-step development. We\nexamine the plasma and magnetic field characteristics of the driving coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) in connection with the development of the geomagnetic\nstorms. A particular effort is to reconstruct the in situ structure using a\nGrad-Shafranov technique and compare the reconstruction results with solar\nobservations, which gives a larger spatial perspective of the source conditions\nthan one-dimensional in situ measurements. Key results are obtained concerning\nhow the plasma and magnetic field characteristics of CMEs control the\ngeomagnetic storm intensity and variability: (1) a sheath-ejecta-ejecta\nmechanism and a sheath-sheath-ejecta scenario are proposed for the multi-step\ndevelopment of the 2015 March 17 and June 22 geomagnetic storms, respectively;\n(2) two contrasting cases of how the CME flux-rope characteristics generate\nintense geomagnetic storms are found, which indicates that a southward\nflux-rope orientation is not a necessity for a strong geomagnetic storm; and\n(3) the unexpected 2015 March 17 intense geomagnetic storm resulted from the\ninteraction between two successive CMEs plus the compression by a high-speed\nstream from behind, which is essentially the \"perfect storm\" scenario proposed\nby \\citet[][i.e., a combination of circumstances results in an event of unusual\nmagnitude]{liu14a}, so the \"perfect storm\" scenario may not be as rare as the\nphrase implies.\n",

We impose an initial\nambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a\nspectrum of large-scale, linearly-polarized, random-phase Alfv\\'enic\nfluctuations which have energy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic\nfluctuations and vanishing correlation between the two fields. A turbulent\ncascade rapidly develops, magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov-like\npower-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at ion scales. The\nturbulent cascade leads to an overall anisotropic proton heating, protons are\nheated in the perpendicular direction, and, initially, also in the parallel\ndirection. The imposed expansion leads to generation of a large parallel proton\ntemperature anisotropy which is at later stages partly reduced by turbulence.\nThe turbulent heating is not sufficient to overcome the expansion-driven\nperpendicular cooling and the system eventually drives the oblique firehose\ninstability in a form of localized nonlinear wave packets which efficiently\nreduce the parallel temperature anisotropy. This work demonstrates that kinetic\ninstabilities may coexist with strong plasma turbulence even in a constrained\n2-D regime.\n",

Reformation is a process,\ndriven by microphysics, which typically occurs at high Mach number\nsupercritical shocks. While ongoing studies have investigated this process\nextensively both theoretically and via simulations, their observations remain\nfew and far between. In this letter we present a study of very high Mach number\nshocks in a parameter space that has been poorly explored and we identify\nreformation using in situ magnetic field observations from the Cassini\nspacecraft at 10 AU. This has given us an insight into quasi-perpendicular\nshocks across two orders of magnitude in Alfven Mach number (MA) which could\npotentially bridge the gap between modest terrestrial shocks and more exotic\nastrophysical shocks. For the first time, we show evidence for cyclic\nreformation controlled by specular ion reflection occurring at the predicted\ntimescale of ~0.3 {\\tau}c, where {\\tau}c is the ion gyroperiod. In addition, we\nexperimentally reveal the relationship between reformation and MA and focus on\nthe magnetic structure of such shocks to further show that for the same MA, a\nreforming shock exhibits stronger magnetic field amplification than a shock\nthat is not reforming.\n",

During their 38-year trip, they have collected data regarding solar\nwind properties (such as the plasma velocity and magnetic field intensity).\nUnfortunately, a complete time evolution of the measured physical quantities is\nnot available. The time series contains many gaps which increase in frequency\nand duration at larger distances. The aim of this work is to perform a spectral\nand statistical analysis of the solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic field\nusing Voyager 2 data measured in 1979, when the gaps/signal ratio is of order\nof unity. This analysis is achieved using four different data reconstruction\ntechniques: averages on linearly interpolated subsets, correlation of linearly\ninterpolated data, compressed sensing spectral estimation, and maximum\nlikelihood data reconstruction. With five frequency decades, the spectra we\nobtained have the largest frequency range ever computed at 5 astronomical units\nfrom the Sun; spectral exponents have been determined for all the components of\nthe velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Void analysis is also useful in\nrecovering other spectral properties such as integral scales (see for instance\nTable 4) and, if the confidence level of the measurements is sufficiently high,\nthe decay variation in the small scale range due, for instance, to dissipative\neffects.\n",

We find that PCA analysis is very different from the\ntools based on the traditional power spectrum of PPV data cubes. Our major\nfinding is that PCA is also sensitive to the phase information of PPV cubes and\nthis allows PCA to detect the changes of the underlying velocity and density\nspectra at high opacities, where the spectral analysis of the maps provides the\nuniversal -3 spectrum in accordance with the predictions of Lazarian \\&\nPogosyan (2004) theory. This makes PCA potentially a valuable tool for studies\nof turbulence at high opacities provided that the proper gauging of the PCA\nindex is made. The later, however, we found to be not easy, as the PCA results\nchange in an irregular way for data with high sonic Mach numbers. This is in\ncontrast to synthetic Brownian noise data used for velocity and density fields\nthat show monotonic PCA behavior.

Wave particle interactions and magnetic\nreconnection are two possible dissipation mechanisms, but which mechanism\ndominates is still a controversial topic. Here we analyze the dissipation\nregion scaling around a solar wind magnetic reconnection region. We find that\nthe magnetic reconnection region shows a unique multifractal scaling in the\ndissipation range, while the ambient solar wind turbulence reveals a\nmonofractal dissipation process for most of the time.

Although the design of the\ninstrument is optimized to measure proton and helium isotope spectra up to 50\nMeV nucleon$^{-1}$ , the capability exists to determine proton energy spectra\nfrom 250 MeV up to above 1.6 GeV. Therefore we developed a sophisticated\ninversion method to calculate such proton spectra. The method relies on a\nGEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of the instrument and a simplified spacecraft\nmodel that calculates the energy-response function of EPHIN for electrons,\nprotons and heavier ions. For validation purposes, proton spectra based on this\nmethod are compared to various balloon missions and space instrumentation. As a\nresult we present annual galactic cosmic ray spectra from 1995 to 2014.\n",

The heliopause, analogous to the\nmagnetopause forming the outer boundary of the lobes, may then lie beyond this\nso-called \"heliocliff\". Even if this analogy is incorrect, the remarkable\nsimilarities between the energetic particle and magnetic field observations in\nthese very different regions are worth noting.\n",

Such a system may be subject to\nthe ion-kinetic tearing instability, and hence generate magnetic islands and\nhot populations of ions associated with magnetic reconnection. Reconnection\nprocesses in this environment have important implications for local particle\ntransport, and for particle acceleration at reconnection sites and in\nturbulence. We study this complex environment by means of three-dimensional\nhybrid simulations over long time scales, in order to capture the evolution\nfrom linear growth of the tearing instability to a fully developed turbulent\nstate at late times. The final state develops from the highly ordered initial\nstate via both forward and inverse cascades. Component and spectral anisotropy\nin the magnetic fluctuations is present when a guide field is included. The\ninclusion of a population of new-born interstellar pickup protons does not\nstrongly affect these results.

The anti-correlation found for the core and halo\ntemperatures is consistent with the radial evolution of the Kappa model,\nclarifying an apparent contradiction in previous observational analysis and\nproviding valuable clues about the temperature of the Kappa-distributed\npopulations. However, these two components manifest a clear tendency to deviate\nfrom isotropy in the same direction, that seems to confirm the existence of\nmechanisms with similar effects on both components, e.g., the solar wind\nexpansion, or the particle heating by the fluctuations. On the other hand, the\nexistence of plasma states with anti-correlated anisotropies of the core and\nhalo populations suggests a dynamic interplay of these components, mediated,\nmost probably, by the anisotropy-driven instabilities.\n",

The acceleration\nof particles is considered to be due to diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\nAims. We aim at a better understanding of DSA in the case of quasi-parallel\nshocks, in which self-generated turbulence in the shock vicinity plays a key\nrole. Methods. We have developed and applied a new Monte Carlo simulation code\nfor acceleration of protons in parallel coronal shocks. The code performs a\nself-consistent calculation of resonant interactions of particles with Alfv\\'en\nwaves based on the quasi-linear theory. In contrast to the existing Monte Carlo\ncodes of DSA, the new code features the full quasi-linear resonance condition\nof particle pitch-angle scattering. This allows us to take anisotropy of\nparticle pitch-angle scattering into account, while the older codes implement\nan approximate resonance condition leading to isotropic scattering.We performed\nsimulations with the new code and with an old code, applying the same initial\nand boundary conditions, and have compared the results provided by both codes\nwith each other, and with the predictions of the steady-state theory. Results.\nWe have found that anisotropic pitch-angle scattering leads to less efficient\nacceleration of particles than isotropic. However, extrapolations to particle\ninjection rates higher than those we were able to use suggest the capability of\nDSA to produce relativistic particles. The particle and wave distributions in\nthe foreshock as well as their time evolution, provided by our new simulation\ncode, are significantly different from the previous results and from the\nsteady-state theory. Specifically, the mean free path in the simulations with\nthe new code is increasing with energy, in contrast to the theoretical result.\n",

Here we present a new approach for visualising and studying\nfield-aligned irregularities (FAIs), which involves transforming\ninterferometric measurements of TEC gradients onto a magnetic shell tangent\nplane. This removes the perspective distortion associated with the oblique\nviewing angle of the irregularities from the ground, facilitating the\ndecomposition of dynamics along and across magnetic field lines. We apply this\ntransformation to the dataset of Loi et al. [2015a], obtained on 15 October\n2013 by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope and displaying\nprominent FAIs. We study these FAIs in the new reference frame, quantifying\nfield-aligned and field-transverse behaviour, examining time and altitude\ndependencies, and extending the analysis to FAIs on sub-array scales. We show\nthat the inclination of the plane can be derived solely from the data, and\nverify that the best-fit value is consistent with the known magnetic\ninclination. The ability of the model to concentrate the fluctuations along a\nsingle spatial direction may find practical application to future calibration\nstrategies for widefield interferometry, by providing a compact representation\nof FAI-induced distortions.\n",

RHESSI clock offset is evaluated and\nfound to experience changes on the 5 August 2005 and 21 October 2013, based on\nthe analysis of TGF-WWLLN matches. The clock offsets were found for all three\nperiods of observations with standard deviations less than 100 {\\mu}s. This\nresult opens the possibility for the precise comparative analyses of RHESSI\nTGFs with the other types of data (WWLLN, radio measurements, etc.) In case of\nmultiple-peak TGFs, WWLLN detections are observed to be simultaneous with the\nlast TGF peak for all 16 cases of multipeak RHESSI TGFs simultaneous with WWLLN\nsources. VLF magnetic field sferics were recorded for two of these 16 events at\nDuke University. These radio measurements also attribute VLF sferics to the\nsecond peak of the double TGFs, exhibiting no detectable radio emission during\nthe first TGF peak. Possible scenarios explaining these observations are\nproposed. Double (multipeak) TGFs could help to distinguish between the VLF\nradio emission radiated by the recoil currents in the +IC leader channel and\nthe VLF emission from the TGF producing electrons.\n",

It was an\ninitially west-oriented CME and expected to only cause a weak geomagnetic\ndisturbance. Why did this CME finally cause such a large geomagnetic storm? We\ntry to find some clues by investigating its propagation from the Sun to 1 AU.\nFirst, we reconstruct the CME's kinematic properties in the corona from the\nSOHO and SDO imaging data with the aid of the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS)\nmodel. It is suggested that the CME propagated to the west\n$\\sim$$33^\\circ$$\\pm$$10^\\circ$ away from the Sun-Earth line with a speed of\nabout 817 km s$^{-1}$ before leaving the field of view of the SOHO/LASCO C3\ncamera. A magnetic cloud (MC) corresponding to this CME was measured in-situ by\nthe Wind spacecraft two days later. By applying two MC reconstruction methods,\nwe infer the configuration of the MC as well as some kinematic information,\nwhich implies that the CME possibly experienced an eastward deflection on its\nway to 1 AU. However, due to the lack of observations from the STEREO\nspacecraft, the CME's kinematic evolution in interplanetary space is not clear.\nIn order to fill this gap, we utilize numerical MHD simulation, drag-based CME\npropagation model (DBM) and the model for CME deflection in interplanetary\nspace (DIPS) to recover the propagation process, especially the trajectory, of\nthe CME from $30 R_S$ to 1 AU. It is suggested that the trajectory of the CME\nwas deflected toward the Earth by about $12^\\circ$, consistent with the\nimplication from the MC reconstruction at 1 AU. This eastward deflection\nprobably contributed to the CME's unexpected geoeffectiveness by pushing the\ncenter of the initially west-oriented CME closer to the Earth.\n",

Strong restrictions on how much\nclose it can get derive from the maximum temperature that the used materials\ncan stand, in order not to compromise the spacecraft's activity and\nfunctionalities. In other words, the minimum perihelion distance of a given\nmission can be determined based on the materials' temperature restrictions. The\ntemperature of an object in space depends on its optical properties:\nreflectivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, and emissivity. Usually, it is\nconsidered as an approximation that the optical properties of materials are\nconstant. However, emissivity depends on temperature. The consideration of the\ntemperature dependence of emissivity and conductivity of materials used in the\naerospace industry leads to the conclusion that the temperature dependence on\nthe heliocentric distance is different from the case of constant optical\nproperties [1]. Particularly, taking into account that emissivity is directly\nproportional to the temperature, the temperature of an object increases as\n$r{}^{-2/5}$ when the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases. This means that the\nsame temperature will actually be reached at a different distance and,\neventually, the spacecraft will be allowed to approach closer to the Sun\nwithout compromising its activities. We focused on metals used for aerospace\nstructures (Al, Ti), however our analysis can be extended to all kinds of\ncomposite materials, once their optical properties - in particular emissivity -\nare defined.\n",

These\nprocesses are dominated by the scattering of particles off magnetic\nirregularities. The scattering process itself is usually described by\nsmall-angle scattering with the pitch-angle coefficient $D_{\\mu\\mu}$ playing a\nmajor role. Since the diffusion coefficient $D_{\\mu\\mu}$ can be determined\nanalytically only for the approximation of quasi-linear theory, the\ndetermination of this coefficient from numerical simulations has, therefore,\nbecome more important. So far these simulations yield particle tracks for\nsmall-scale scattering, which can then be interpreted using the running\ndiffusion coefficients. This method has a limited range of validity. This paper\npresents two new methods that allow for the calculation of the pitch-angle\ndiffusion coefficient from numerical simulations. These methods no longer\nanalyse particle trajectories, but the change of particle distribution\nfunctions. It is shown that they provide better resolved results and allow for\nthe analysis of strong turbulence. The application of these methods to Monte\nCarlo simulations of particle scattering and hybrid MHD-particle simulations is\npresented. Both analysis methods are able to recover the diffusion coefficients\nused as input for the Monte Carlo simulations and provide better results in MHD\nsimulations especially for stronger turbulence.\n",

In this paper we study the\npropagation through interplanetary space of SEP Fe ions, injected near the Sun\nwith a variety of charge states that are uniformly distributed in energy, by\nmeans of a 3D test particle model. In our simulations, due to gradient and\ncurvature drifts associated with the Parker spiral magnetic field, ions of\ndifferent charge propagate with very different efficiencies to an observer that\nis not magnetically well connected to the source region. As a result we find\nthat, for many observer locations, the 1 AU event-averaged charge state <Q>, as\nobtained from our model, displays an increase with particle energy E, in\nqualitative agreement with spacecraft observations. We conclude that\ndrift-associated propagation is a possible explanation for the observed\ndistribution of <Q> versus E in SEP events, and that the distribution measured\nin interplanetary space cannot be taken to represent that at injection.\n",

In this work, we conduct\na numerical simulation to investigate multi-scale PBSs and in particular their\nformation in compressive MHD turbulence. By the use of a higher order Godunov\ncode Athena,a driven compressible turbulence with an imposed uniform guide\nfield is simulated. The simulation results show that both the magnetic pressure\nand the thermal pressure exhibit a turbulent spectrum with a Kolmogorov-like\npower law, and that in many regions of the simulation domain they are\nanti-correlated. The computed wavelet cross-coherence spectrum of the magnetic\npressure and the thermal pressure, as well as their space series, indicate the\nexistence of multi-scale PBSs, with the small PBSs being embedded in the large\nones. These multi-scale PBSs are likely to be related with the highly\noblique-propagating slow-mode waves, as the traced multi-scale PBS is found to\nbe traveling in a certain direction at a speed consistent with that predicted\ntheoretically for a slow-mode wave propagating in the same direction.\n",

We focus on the physical processes occurring in the outer\nheliosphere, especially at its boundary called the heliopause (HP), and in the\nLISM. The importance of magnetic field, charge exchange between atoms and ions,\nand solar cycle on the heliopause topology and observed heliocentric distances\nto different heliospheric discontinuities are discussed. It is shown that\ntime-dependent boundary conditions are necessary to describe the heliospheric\nasymmetries detected by the Voyager spacecraft. We also discuss the structure\nof the HP, especially due to its instability and magnetic reconnection. It is\ndemonstrated that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the nose of the HP creates\nconsecutive layers of the interstellar and heliospheric plasma which are\nmagnetically connected to different sources. This may be a possible explanation\nof abrupt changes in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by\nVoyager 1 when it was crossing the HP structure for a period of about one month\nin the summer of 2012. This paper also discusses the plausibility of fitting\nsimulation results to a number of observational data sets obtained by in situ\nand remote measurements. The distribution of magnetic field in the vicinity of\nthe HP is discussed in the context of Voyager measurements. We discuss the\ntransport of energetic particles in the inner and outer heliosheath,\nconcentrating on the anisotropic spatial diffusion diffusion tensor and the\npitch-angle dependence of perpendicular diffusion and demonstrate that the\nlatter can explain the observed pitch-angle anisotropies of both the anomalous\nand galactic cosmic rays in the outer heliosheath.\n",

Here we studied a\nstatistical relation between the event-integrated intensity of GLEs (calculated\nas count-rate relative excess, averaged over all available polar neutron\nmonitors, and expressed in percent-hours) and the hardness of the solar\nparticle energy spectra. For each event the integral omnidirectional\nevent-integrated fluences of particles with energy above 30 MeV ($F_{30}$) and\nabove 200 MeV ($F_{200}$) were computed using the reconstructed spectra, and\nthe ratio between the two fluences was considered as a simple index of the\nevent's hardness. We also provided a justification of the spectrum estimate in\nthe form of the Band-function, using direct PAMELA data for GLE 71\n(17-May-2012). We found that, while there is no clear relation between the\nintensity and the hardness for weak events, all strong events with the\nintensity greater 100 \\%*hr are characterized by a very hard spectrum. This\nimplies that a hard spectrum can be securely assumed for all extreme GLE\nevents, e.g., those studied using cosmogenic isotope data in the past.\n",

By\ntriangulating isolated CME signal from the three coronagraphs over a sliding\nwindow of five hours, the most likely region through which CMEs pass at 5 solar\nradii is identified. The centre and size of the region gives the most likely\ndirection of propagation and approximate angular extent. The Automated CME\nTriangulation (ACT) method is tested extensively using a series of synthetic\nCME images created using a wireframe flux rope density model, and on a sample\nof real coronagraph data; including halo CMEs. The accuracy of the angular\ndifference between the detection and true input of the synthetic CMEs is 7.14\ndegrees, and remains acceptable for a broad range of CME positions relative to\nthe observer, the relative separation of the three observers and even through\nthe loss of one coronagraph. For real data, the method gives results that\ncompare well with the distribution of low coronal sources and results from\nanother instrument and technique made further from the Sun. The true three\ndimension (3D)-corrected kinematics and mass/density are discussed. The results\nof the new method will be incorporated into the CORIMP database in the near\nfuture, enabling improved space weather diagnostics and forecasting.\n",

More specifically, applications such as a) an\noptimized automated Ground Level Enhancement Alert (GLE Alert Plus) b) a web\ninterface, providing data from mul- tiple Neutron Monitor stations\n(Multi-Station tool) and c) a simulation model, named DYnamic Atmospheric\nShower Tracking Interactive Model Application (DYASTIMA), which allows the\nstudy of the cosmic ray showers resulted when primary cosmic ray particles\nenters the atmosphere, have been developed. The two first applications are\ncurrently federated products in European Space Agency (ESA) and actually\navailable via the Space Weather Portal operated by ESA. On the other hand, the\ncontribution of the simulation tool DYASTIMA, based on the well known Geant4\ntoolkit, to the calculations of the radiation dose received by air crews and\npassengers within the Earth's atmosphere led us to develop an extended\napplication of DYASTIMA named DYASTIMA-R. This new application calculates the\nenergy that is deposited on the phantom and moreover the equivalent dose.\nFurthermore, a Space Weather Forecasting Center which provides a three day\ngeomagnetic activity report on a daily basis has been set up and is operating\nat the Athens Neutron Monitor Sta- tion.

As an\nexample, the abundance of B between about 7 and 15 MeV per nuc is unexpectedly\nlarge, greater than the prediction of a LBM by 2 or 3 in the measurement and\ncross section error. On the other hand, for several other heavier secondary\nnuclei with a low source abundance such as F and Z equal 17 to 19 and 21 to 23\nnuclei, in the corresponding energy channels between about 10-20 MeV/nuc, zero\nnuclei have been observed. The same LBM calculations would predict about 6 to 7\nevents for the sum of these three groups of nuclei. The B observed intensities\ncould be more closely matched by considering a nested LBM with 0.3-1.0 g/cm2 of\nmatter near the cosmic ray sources, essentially a source component of B. This\nnested LBM calculation, if extended to the production of the above groups of\nsecondaries, would however predict a total 8 to 12 events thus leading to an\neven larger discrepancy with the zero events that are observed. The\nmeasurements of heavier secondaries at low energies therefore make it very\nproblematical that a nested LBM with more than a few 0.1 g/cm2 or more of\nmatter near the sources could be the source of the large B abundance seen by\nVoyager. The large abundance of B at the lowest energies is best understood, so\nfar, as the result of production mostly from a matter traversal of 10 g/cm2 in\nthe galaxy, possibly in combination with uncertainties in the data and cross\nsections at these low energies.\n",

        "summary": "  The remoteness of the Sun and the harsh conditions prevailing in the solar\ncorona have so far limited the observational data used in the study of solar\nphysics to remote-sensing observations taken either from the ground or from\nspace. In contrast, the `solar wind laboratory' is directly measured in situ by\na fleet of spacecraft measuring the properties of the plasma and magnetic\nfields at specific points in space. Since 2007, the solar-terrestrial relations\nobservatory (STEREO) has been providing images of the solar wind that flows\nbetween the solar corona and spacecraft making in-situ measurements. This has\nallowed scientists to directly connect processes imaged near the Sun with the\nsubsequent effects measured in the solar wind. This new capability prompted the\ndevelopment of a series of tools and techniques to track heliospheric\nstructures through space. This article presents one of these tools, a web-based\ninterface called the 'Propagation Tool' that offers an integrated research\nenvironment to study the evolution of coronal and solar wind structures, such\nas Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) and\nSolar Energetic Particles (SEPs). These structures can be propagated from the\nSun outwards to or alternatively inwards from planets and spacecraft situated\nin the inner and outer heliosphere. In this paper, we present the global\narchitecture of the tool, discuss some of the assumptions made to simulate the\nevolution of the structures and show how the tool connects to different\ndatabases.\n",

The seasonal variation in the relation between monthly\n$\\Delta{H}$ and solar wind speed is taken into account by calculating separate\nregressions between $\\Delta{H}$ and SW speed for each month. Thereby, we obtain\na homogeneous series of proxy values for monthly solar wind speed for the last\n100 years.

Practically all these years are the same or adjacent to\nthe years of annual maximum solar wind speeds. This implies that the most\npersistent coronal holes, lasting for several solar rotations and leading to\nthe highest annual SW speeds, are also the sources of the highest monthly SW\nspeeds. Accordingly, during the last 100 years, there were no coronal holes of\nshort duration (of about one solar rotation) that would produce faster monthly\n(or solar rotation) averaged solar wind than the most long-living coronal holes\nin each solar cycle produce.\n",

However, the\nVoyager 1 spacecraft measured very little rotation across the HP. Previously we\nshowed that the $B_{ISM}$ twists as it approaches the HP and acquires a strong\nT component (East-West). Here we establish that reconnection in the eastern\nflank of the heliosphere is responsible for the twist. On the eastern flank the\nsolar magnetic field has twisted into the positive N direction and reconnects\nwith the Southward pointing component of the $B_{ISM}$. Reconnection drives a\nrotational discontinuity (RD) that twists the $B_{ISM}$ into the -T direction\nand propagates upstream in the interstellar medium towards the nose. The\nconsequence is that the N component of $B_{ISM}$ is reduced in a finite width\nband upstream of the HP. Voyager 1 currently measures angles\n($\\delta=sin^{-1}(B_{N}/B)$) close to solar values. We present MHD simulations\nto support this scenario, suppressing reconnection in the nose region while\nallowing it in the flanks, consistent with recent ideas about reconnection\nsuppression from diamagnetic drifts. The jump in plasma $\\beta$ (the plasma to\nmagnetic pressure) across the nose of HP is much greater than in the flanks\nbecause the heliosheath $\\beta$ is greater there than in the flanks.\nLarge-scale reconnection is therefore suppressed in the nose but not at the\nflanks. Simulation data suggest that $B_{ISM}$ will return to its pristine\nvalue $10-15~AU$ past the HP.\n",

For seven of these CMEs we use the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS)\nflux rope model to determine the CME trajectory using both Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and coronagraph\nimages. We then use the Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) model\nfor nonradial CME dynamics driven by magnetic forces, to simulate the\ndeflection and rotation of the seven CMEs. We find good agreement between the\nForeCAT results and the reconstructed CME positions and orientations. The CME\ndeflections range in magnitude between 10 degrees and 30 degrees. All CMEs\ndeflect to the north but we find variations in the direction of the\nlongitudinal deflection. The rotations range between 5\\mydeg and 50\\mydeg with\nboth clockwise and counterclockwise rotations occurring. Three of the CMEs\nbegin with initial positions within 2 degrees of one another. These three CMEs\nall deflect primarily northward, with some minor eastward deflection, and\nrotate counterclockwise. Their final positions and orientations, however,\nrespectively differ by 20 degrees and 30 degrees. This variation in deflection\nand rotation results from differences in the CME expansion and radial\npropagation close to the Sun, as well as the CME mass. Ultimately, only one of\nthese seven CMEs yielded discernible in situ signatures near Earth, despite the\nactive region facing near Earth throughout the eruptions. We suggest that the\ndifferences in the deflection and rotation of the CMEs can explain whether each\nCME impacted or missed the Earth.\n",

We have not identified any periods with only cold electrons present.\nThe electron flux to Rosetta was always dominated by higher energies, driving\nthe spacecraft potential to order -10 V. The warm (5--10 eV) electron\npopulation is interpreted as electrons retaining the energy they obtained when\nreleased in the ionisation process.

A sequence of events started with an M3.5 X-ray class\nflare on 22 August 2015 at 21:19 UTC. The \\textit{\\textit{New-Tupi}} muon\ntelescopes observed a Forbush decrease (FD) triggered by this geomagnetic\nstorm, with onset on 26 August 2015. After the Earth crossed a heliospheric\ncurrent sheet (HCS), an increase in the particle flux was observed on 28 August\n2015 by spacecrafts and ground level detectors. The observed peak was in\ntemporal coincidence with the impact of a high speed stream (HSS). We study\nthis increase, that has been observed with a significance above 1.5\\% by ground\nlevel detectors in different rigidity regimes. We also estimate the lower limit\nof the energy fluence injected on Earth. In addition, we consider the origin of\nthis increase, such as acceleration of particles by shock waves on the front of\nthe HSS and the focusing effect of the HCS crossing. Our results show possible\nevidence of a prolonged energetic (up to GeV energies) particle injection\nwithin the Earth atmosphere system, driven by the HSS. In most cases these\ninjected particles are directed to polar regions. However, the particles from\nthe high energy tail of the spectrum can reach middle latitudes, and that could\nhave consequences for the atmospheric chemistry, for instance, the creation of\nNOx species may be enhanced and can lead to increased ozone depletion.

Here we investigate how the uncertainty in the orientation of a\nscale dependent background magnetic field influences the ability to resolve\nanisotropy. Therefore we introduce a quantitative measure, the angle\nuncertainty, which characterizes the uncertainty of the orientation of the\nbackground magnetic field which turbulent structures are exposed to. The angle\nuncertainty can be used as a condition to estimate the ability to resolve\nanisotropy with certain accuracy. We apply our description to resolve spectral\nanisotropy in fast solar wind data. We show that if the angle uncertainty grows\ntoo large, the power of the turbulent fluctuations is attributed to false local\nmagnetic field angles, which may lead to an incorrect estimation of spectral\nindices. In our results an apparent robustness of the spectral anisotropy to\nfalse local magnetic field angles is observed, which can be explained by a\nstronger increase of power for lower frequencies when the scale of the local\nmagnetic field is increased. The frequency dependent angle uncertainty is a\nmeasure which can be applied to any turbulent system.\n",

Recently, it\nhas been suggested that initially the particles propagate systematically along\nmeandering field lines, and only later reach the time-asymptotic diffusive\ncross-field propagation. In this paper, we analyse cross-field propagation of\n1--100 MeV protons in composite 2D-slab turbulence superposed on a constant\nbackground magnetic field, using full-orbit particle simulations, to study the\nnon-diffusive phase of particle propagation with a wide range of turbulence\nparameters. We show that the early-time non-diffusive propagation of the\nparticles is consistent with particle propagation along turbulently meandering\nfield lines. This results in a wide cross-field extent of the particles already\nat the initial arrival of particles to a given distance along the mean field\ndirection, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle transport models. The\ncross-field extent of the particle distribution remains constant for up to tens\nof hours in turbulence environment consistent with the inner heliosphere during\nsolar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the particles escape from their\ninitial meandering field lines, and the particle propagation across the mean\nfield reaches time-asymptotic diffusion. Our analysis shows that in order to\nunderstand solar energetic particle event origins, particle transport modelling\nmust include non-diffusive particle propagation along meandering field lines.\n",

Using the magnetic field data\nfrom the STEREO mission, this Letter carries out a survey of ECWs over a long\nperiod of 7 years, and calculates the occurrence rates of ECWs with different\npolarization senses. Results show that the occurrence rate is nearly a constant\nfor the ECWs with right-handed polarization, but it varies significantly for\nthe ECWs with LH polarization. Further investigation of plasma conditions\nreveals that the LH ECWs take place preferentially in a plasma characterized by\nhigher temperature, lower density, and larger velocity. Some considerable\ncorrelations between the occurrence rate of LH ECWs and the properties of\nambient plasmas are discussed. The present research may provide evidence for\neffect of alpha particles on generation of ECWs.\n",

        "summary": "  The location of the terrestrial magnetopause (MP) and it's subsolar stand-off\ndistance depends not only on the solar wind dynamic pressure and the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF), both of which play a crucial role in\ndetermining it's shape, but also on the nature of the processes involved in the\ninteraction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. The stand-off\ndistance of the earth's MP and bow shock (BS) also define the extent of\nterrestrial magnetic fields into near-earth space on the sunward side and have\nimportant consequences for space weather. However, asymmetries due to the\ndirection of the IMF are hard to account for, making it nearly impossible to\nfavour any specific model over the other in estimating the extent of the MP or\nBS. Thus, both numerical and empirical models have been used and compared to\nestimate the BS and MP stand-off distances as well as the MP shape, in the\nperiod Jan. 1975-Dec. 2016, covering solar cycles 21-24. The computed MP and BS\nstand-off distances have been found to be increasing steadily over the past two\ndecades, since ~1995, spanning solar cycles 23 and 24. The increasing trend is\nconsistent with earlier reported studies of a long term and steady decline in\nsolar polar magnetic fields and solar wind micro-turbulence levels. The present\nstudy, thus, highlights the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere to the\nlong term global changes in both solar and solar wind activity, through a\ndetailed study of the extent and shape of the terrestrial MP and BS over the\npast four solar cycles, a period spanning the last four decades.\n",

We present for the first time a statistical test for one of the\nproposed mechanisms, stochastic ion heating. We use the amplitude of magnetic\nfield fluctuations near the proton gyroscale as a proxy for the ratio of\ngyroscale velocity fluctuations to perpendicular (with respect to the magnetic\nfield) proton thermal speed, defined as $\\epsilon_p$. Enhanced proton\ntemperatures are observed when $\\epsilon_p$ is larger than a critical value\n($\\sim 0.019 - 0.025$). This enhancement strongly depends on the proton plasma\nbeta ($\\beta_{||p}$); when $\\beta_{||p} \\ll 1$ only the perpendicular proton\ntemperature $T_{\\perp}$ increases, while for $\\beta_{||p} \\sim 1$ increased\nparallel and perpendicular proton temperatures are both observed. For\n$\\epsilon_p$ smaller than the critical value and $\\beta_{||p} \\ll 1$ no\nenhancement of $T_p$ is observed while for $\\beta_{||p} \\sim 1$ minor increases\nin $T_{\\parallel}$ are measured. The observed change of proton temperatures\nacross a critical threshold for velocity fluctuations is in agreement with the\nstochastic ion heating model of Chandran et al. (2010).

The omnidirectional magnetic field spectrum shows a\ndouble power-law behavior over almost two decades in wavenumber, with a\nKolmogorov-like index at large scales, a spectral break around ion scales, and\na steepening at sub-ion scales. Power laws are also observed in the spectra of\nthe ion bulk velocity, density, and electric field, both at magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) and at kinetic scales. Despite the complex structure, the omnidirectional\nspectra of all fields at ion and sub-ion scales are in remarkable quantitative\nagreement with those of a two-dimensional (2D) simulation with similar physical\nparameters. This provides a partial, a-posteriori validation of the 2D\napproximation at kinetic scales. Conversely, at MHD scales, the spectra of the\ndensity and of the velocity (and, consequently, of the electric field) exhibit\ndifferences between the 2D and 3D cases. Although they can be partly ascribed\nto the lower spatial resolution, the main reason is likely the larger\nimportance of compressible effects in a full geometry.

Some places are exceptionally well suitable for\nground-based detection of SEP - high-elevation polar regions with negligible\ngeomagnetic and reduced atmospheric energy/rigidity cutoffs. At present, there\nare two neutron-monitor stations in such locations on the Antarctic plateau:\nSOPO/SOPB (at Amundsen-Scott station, 2835 m elevation), and DOMC/DOMB (at\nConcordia station, 3233 m elevation). Since 2015, when the DOMC/DOMB station\nstarted continuous operation, a relatively weak SEP event that was not detected\nby sea-level neutron-monitor stations was registered by both SOPO/SOPB and\nDOMC/DOMB, and it was accordingly classified as a GLE. This would lead to a\ndistortion of the homogeneity of the historic GLE list and the corresponding\nstatistics. To address this issue, we propose to modify the GLE definition so\nthat it maintains the homogeneity: A GLE event is registered when there are\nnear-time coincident and statistically significant enhancements of the count\nrates of at least two differently located neutron monitors, including at least\none neutron monitor near sea level and a corresponding enhancement in the\nproton flux measured by a space-borne instrument(s). Relatively weak SEP events\nregistered only by high-altitude polar neutron monitors, but with no response\nfrom cosmic-ray stations at sea level, can be classified as sub-GLEs.\n",

        "summary": "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of geomagnetic\ndisturbances, but the effects of their interaction with Earth's magnetic field\ndepend on their magnetic configuration and orientation. Fitting and\nreconstruction techniques have been developed to determine the important\ngeometrical and physical CME properties. In many instances, there is\ndisagreement between such different methods but also between fitting from in\nsitu measurements and reconstruction based on remote imaging. Here, we compare\nthree methods based on different assumptions for measurements of thirteen CMEs\nby the Wind spacecraft from 1997 to 2015. These CMEs are selected from the\ninterplanetary coronal mass ejections catalog on\nhttps://wind.nasa.gov/ICMEindex.php due to their simplicity in terms of 1)\nsmall expansion speed throughout the CME and 2) little asymmetry in the\nmagnetic field profile. This makes these thirteen events ideal candidates to\ncompare codes that do not include expansion nor distortion. We find that, for\nthese simple events, the codes are in relatively good agreement in terms of the\nCME axis orientation for six out of the 13 events. Using the Grad-Shafranov\ntechnique, we can determine the shape of the cross-section, which is assumed to\nbe circular for the other two models, a force-free fitting and a\ncircular-cylindrical non-force-free fitting. Five of the events are found to\nhave a clear circular cross-section, even when this is not a pre-condition of\nthe reconstruction. We make an initial attempt at evaluating the adequacy of\nthe different assumptions for these simple CMEs. The conclusion of this work\nstrongly suggests that attempts at reconciling in situ and remote-sensing views\nof CMEs must take in consideration the compatibility of the different models\nwith specific CME structures to better reproduce flux ropes.\n",

Aims: We study a non-resonant reactive\ninstability of Alfv\\'en waves (AWs) propagating quasi-parallel to the\nbackground magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$ in such systems. Methods: The\ninstability is investigated analytically in the framework of kinetic theory\napplied to the hydrogen plasmas penetrated by hot proton beams. Results: The\ninstability arises at parallel wavenumbers $k_{z}$ that are sufficiently large\nto demagnetize the beam ions, $k_{z}V_{Tb}/\\omega_{Bi}\\gtrsim $ $1$ (here\n$V_{Tb}$ is the beam thermal speed along $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$ and $\\omega _{Bi}$ is\nthe ion-cyclotron frequency). The Alfv\\'en mode is then made unstable by the\nimbalance of perturbed currents carried by the magnetized background electrons\nand partially demagnetized beam ions. The destabilizing effects of the beam\ntemperature and the temperature dependence of the instability threshold and\ngrowth rate are demonstrated for the first time. The beam temperature, density,\nand bulk speed are all destabilizing and can be combined in a single\ndestabilizing factor $\\alpha_{b}$ triggering the instability at {$\\alpha _{b}>$\n$\\alpha _{b}^{\\mathrm{thr}}$}, where the threshold varies in a narrow range\n$2.43\\leq $ $\\alpha _{b}^{\\mathrm{thr}}\\leq $ $4.87$. New analytical\nexpressions for the instability growth rate and its boundary in the parameter\nspace are obtained and can be directly compared with observations. Two\napplications to terrestrial foreshocks and foreshocks around supernova remnants\nare shortly discussed. In particular, our results suggest that the ions\nreflected by the shocks around supernova remnants can drive stronger\ninstability than the cosmic rays.\n",

Key results are obtained concerning how a weak\nCME can generate a relatively intense geomagnetic storm: (1) there were coronal\nholes at low latitudes, which could produce high speed streams (HSSs) to\ninteract with the CME in interplanetary space; (2) the CME was bracketed\nbetween a slow wind ahead and a HSS behind, which enhanced the southward\nmagnetic field inside the CME and gave rise to the unexpected geomagnetic\nstorm.\n",

It\nproduced four X class flares, more than 20 CMEs and an intense geomagnetic\nstorm, for which the peak value of the Dst index reached up to -142nT at 2017\nSeptember 8 02:00 UT. In this work, we check the interplanetary and solar\nsource of this intense geomagnetic storm. We find that this geomagnetic storm\nwas mainly caused by a shock-ICME complex structure, which was formed by a\nshock driven by the 2017 September 6 CME propagating into a previous ICME which\nwas the interplanetary counterpart of the 2017 September 4 CME. To better\nunderstand the role of this structure, we conduct the quantitative analysis\nabout the enhancement of ICME's geoeffectiveness induced by the shock\ncompression. The analysis shows that the shock compression enhanced the\nintensity of this geomagnetic storm by a factor of two. Without shock\ncompression, there would be only a moderate geomagnetic storm with a peak Dst\nvalue of -79 nT. In addition, the analysis of the proton flux signature inside\nthe shock-ICME complex structure shows that this structure also enhanced the\nsolar energetic particles (SEPs) intensity by a factor of ~ 5. These findings\nillustrate that the shock-ICME complex structure is a very important factor in\nsolar physics study and space weather forecast.\n",

This enhanced anisotropy was normal to the HCS and\nconsistent with a diamagnetic drift arising from the spatial gradient of cosmic\nray density, which indicates that cosmic rays were drifting along the HCS from\nthe north of Earth. We also find a significant anisotropy along the HCS,\nlasting a few hours after the HCS crossing, indicating that cosmic rays\npenetrated into the inner heliosphere along the HCS. Based on the latest\ngeomagnetic field model, we quantitatively evaluate the reduction of the\ngeomagnetic cut-off rigidity and the variation of the asymptotic viewing\ndirection of cosmic rays due to a major geomagnetic storm which occurred during\nthe CRB and conclude that the CRB is not caused by the geomagnetic storm, but\nby a rapid change in the cosmic ray anisotropy and density outside the\nmagnetosphere.\n",

The normal benchmark has been the great\ngeomagnetic storm of September 1859, the so-called \"Carrington Event\". However,\nthere are numerous records of another great geomagnetic storm in February 1872.\nThis storm, about 12 years after the Carrington Event, resulted in comparable\nmagnetic disturbances and auroral displays over large areas of the Earth. We\nhave revisited this great geomagnetic storm in terms of the auroral and sunspot\nrecords in the historical documents from East Asia. In particular, we have\nsurveyed the auroral records from East Asia and estimated the equatorward\nboundary of the auroral oval to be near 24.3 deg invariant latitude (ILAT), on\nthe basis that the aurora was seen near the zenith at Shanghai (20 deg magnetic\nlatitude, MLAT). These results confirm that this geomagnetic storm of February\n1872 was as extreme as the Carrington Event, at least in terms of the\nequatorward motion of the auroral oval. Indeed, our results support the\ninterpretation of the simultaneous auroral observations made at Bombay (10 deg\nMLAT).

Development of numerical approaches that\nwould simulate CME generation and propagation through the interplanetary space\nis an important step towards our capability to predict CME arrival times at\nEarth and their geo-effectiveness. In this paper, we utilize a data-constrained\nGibson--Low (GL) flux rope model to generate CMEs. We derive the geometry of\nthe initial GL flux rope using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) method.\nThis method uses multiple viewpoints from STEREO A & B Cor1/Cor2, and\nSOHO/LASCO C2/C3 coronagraphs to determine the size and orientation of a CME\nflux rope as it starts to erupt from the Sun. A flux rope generated in this way\nis inserted into a quasi-steady global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) background\nsolar wind flow driven by SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetogram data, and erupts\nimmediately. Numerical results obtained with the Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic\nSimulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS) code are compared with STEREO and SOHO/LASCO\ncoronagraph observations in particular in terms of the CME speed, acceleration,\nand magnetic field structure.\n",

        "summary": "  The shape of the solar wind bubble within the interstellar medium, the\nso-called heliosphere, has been explored over six decades. As the Sun moves\nthrough the surrounding partially-ionized medium, neutral hydrogen atoms\npenetrate the heliosphere, and through charge-exchange with the supersonic\nsolar wind, create a population of hot pick-up ions (PUIs). The Termination\nShock (TS) crossing by Voyager 2 (V2) data demonstrated that the heliosheath\n(HS) (the region of shocked solar wind) pressure is dominated by suprathermal\nparticles. Here we use a novel magnetohydrodynamic model that treats the\nfreshly ionized PUIs as a separate fluid from the thermal component of the\nsolar wind. Unlike previous models, the new model reproduces the properties of\nthe PUIs and solar wind ions based on the New Horizon and V2 spacecraft\nobservations. The PUIs charge exchange with the cold neutral H atoms of the ISM\nin the HS and are quickly depleted. The depletion of PUIs cools the heliosphere\ndownstream of the TS, \"deflating\" it and leading to a narrower HS and a smaller\nand rounder shape, in agreement with energetic neutral atom observations by the\nCassini spacecraft. The new model, with interstellar magnetic field orientation\nconstrained by the IBEX ribbon, reproduces the magnetic field data outside the\nHP at Voyager 1(V1). We present the predictions for the magnetic field outside\nthe HP at V2.\n",

However, due to background contamination of the\ndata with high-energy electrons (>400 keV) and inner- zone protons (230-630\nkeV) in the radiation belts and ring current, the data have been rarely used\nfor inner-magnetospheric science. The current paper presents two algorithms for\nbackground correction. The first algorithm is based on the empirical\ncontamination percentages by both protons and electrons. The second algorithm\nuses simultaneous proton observations. The efficiencies of these algorithms are\ndemonstrated by comparison of the corrected Cluster/RAPID/IES data with Van\nAllen Probes/Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) measurements for\n2012-2015. Both techniques improved the IES electron data in the radiation\nbelts and ring current.Yearly averaged flux intensities of the two missions\nshow the ratio of measurements close to 1.

The use of very high power,\nlarge aperture DE systems to propel spacecraft is being pursued as the only\nknown, feasible method to achieve relativistic flight in our NASA Starlight and\nBreakthrough Starshot programs. In addition, other beamed power mission\nscenarios, such as orbital debris removal and our NASA program using DE for\npowering high performance ion engine missions, pose similar concerns. It is\ncritical to quantify the probability and rates of interception of the DE beam\nwith the approximately 2000 active Earth orbiting spacecraft. We have modeled\nthe interception of the beam with satellites by using their orbital parameters\nand computing the likelihood of interception for many of the scenarios of the\nproposed systems we are working on. We are able to simulate both the absolute\ninterception as well as the distance and angle from the beam to the spacecraft,\nand have modeled a number of scenarios to obtain general probabilities. We have\nestablished that the probability of beam interception of any active satellite,\nincluding its orbital position uncertainty, during any of the proposed mission\nscenarios is low ($\\approx10^{-4}$). The outcome of this work gives us the\nability to predict when to energize the beam without intercept, as well as the\ncapability to turn off the DE as needed for extended mission scenarios.

Both, in-space resource provision\nsuch as water and return of platinum to Earth are considered. Starting from\nfirst principles of techno-economic analysis, gradually additional economic and\ntechnological factors are added to the analysis model. Applied to mining\nmissions involving spacecraft reuse, learning curve effect, and multiple\nspacecraft, their economic viability is assessed. A sensitivity analysis with\nrespect to throughput rate, spacecraft mass, and resource price is performed.\nFurthermore, a sample asteroid volatile mining architecture based on small\nCubeSat-class spacecraft is presented.

Using models related to UV and IR auroral\nemissions, we estimate the characteristic time scales for the emissions, and\nevaluate whether the observed differences between UV and IR emissions can be\nunderstood by the differences in the emission time scales. Based on the model\nresults, the UV aurora at Jupiter and Saturn is directly related to excitation\nby auroral electrons that impact molecular H2, occurring over a time scale of\n0.01 sec. The IR auroral emission involves several time scales: while the\nauroral ionization process and IR transitions occur over < 0.01 sec, the time\nscale for ion chemistry is much longer at 0.01-10000 sec. Associated\natmospheric phenomena such as temperature variations and circulation are\neffective over time scales of > 10000 sec. That is, for events that have a time\nscale of ~100 sec, the ion chemistry, present in the IR but absent in the UV\nemission process, could play a key role in producing a different features at\nthe two wavelengths. Applying these results to the observed Jovian polar UV\nintensification events and the Io footprint aurora indicates that whether the\nIR intensity varies in correlation with the UV or not depends on the number\nflux of electrons and their characteristic energy.\n",

We start from a kinetic transport equation\nin the bulk frame of the heliosheath plasma flow taking into account\nshock-induced electron injection, convective changes, cooling processes, and\nwhistler wave-induced energy diffusion. From this equation we proceed to an\nassociated pressure moment of the electron distribution function arriving at a\ncorresponding pressure transport equation which describes the evolution of the\nelectron pressure in the bulk frame of the plasma along the plasma flow lines.\nWe assume that the local distribution function, in view of the prevailing\nnon-LTE conditions, is represented by a local kappa function with local kappa\nparameters that vary with the streamline coordinate $s$ downstream of the solar\nwind termination shock. We obtain the solution for the electron pressure as a\nfunction of the streamline coordinate $s$ from the pressure transport equation\nand demonstrate that, connected with this pressure, one obtains an expression\nfor the entropy of the electron fluid which can also be derived as a streamline\nfunction. We show that the heliosheath electron fluid can essentially be\ncharacterized as an isobaric and isentropic flow.

We find the asymmetry to be less pronounced at Earth than at Mercury,\nindicating a relaxation taking place as ICMEs propagate.

We focus on the 12-day closest\napproach centered on the 1st perihelion. AWSoM (van der Holst et al., 2014)\nallows us to interpret the PSP data in the context of coronal heating via\nAlfv\\'en wave turbulence. The coronal heating and acceleration is addressed via\noutward-propagating low-frequency Alfv\\'en waves that are partially reflected\nby Alfv\\'en speed gradients. The nonlinear interaction of these\ncounter-propagating waves results in a turbulent energy cascade. To apportion\nthe wave dissipation to the electron and anisotropic proton temperatures, we\nemploy the results of the theories of linear wave damping and nonlinear\nstochastic heating as described by Chandran et al. (2011). We find that during\nthe first encounter, PSP was in close proximity to the heliospheric current\nsheet (HCS) and in the slow wind. PSP crossed the HCS two times, namely at\n2018/11/03 UT 01:02 and 2018/11/08 UT 19:09 with perihelion occuring on the\nsouth of side of the HCS. We predict the plasma state along the PSP trajectory,\nwhich shows a dominant proton parallel temperature causing the plasma to be\nfirehose unstable.\n",

        "summary": "  NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker) spacecraft reached its first perihelion of\n35.7 solar radii on November 5th, 2018. To aid in mission planning, and in\nanticipation of the unprecedented measurements to be returned, in late October,\nwe developed a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solution for the\nsolar corona and inner heliosphere, driven by the then available observations\nof the Sun's photospheric magnetic field. Our model incorporates a\nwave-turbulence-driven (WTD) model to heat the corona. Here, we present our\npredictions for the structure of the solar corona and the likely {\\it in situ}\nmeasurements that Parker will be returning over the next few months. We infer\nthat, in the days prior to 1st Encounter, Parker was immersed in wind emanating\nfrom a positive-polarity equatorial coronal hole. During the encounter,\nhowever, field lines from the spacecraft mapped to another, negative-polarity\nequatorial coronal hole. Following the encounter, Parker was magnetically\nconnected to the large, positive-polarity northern polar coronal hole. When the\nParker data become available, these model results can be used to assist in\ntheir calibration and interpretation, and, additionally, provide a global\ncontext for interpreting the localized {\\it in situ} measurements. In\nparticular, we can identify what types of solar wind Parker encountered, what\nthe underlying magnetic structure was, and how complexities in the orbital\ntrajectory can be interpreted within a global, inertial frame. Ultimately, the\nmeasurements returned by Parker can be used to constrain current theories for\nheating the solar corona and accelerating the solar wind.\n",

The solar wind is an ideal plasma\nfor such an investigation, and it now appears to be technologically feasible to\ncarry out such an investigation, following the pioneering Cluster and MMS\nmissions. Quantities that need to be measured using multipoint measurements\ninclude the two-point, two-time second correlation function of velocity,\nmagnetic field and density, and higher order statistical objects such as third\nand fourth order structure functions. Some details of these requirements are\ngiven here, with a eye towards achieving closure on fundamental questions\nregarding the cascade rate, spectral anisotropy, characteristic coherent\nstructures, intermittency, and dissipation mechanisms that describe plasma\nturbuelence, as well as its variability with plasma parameters in the solar\nwind. The motivation for this discussion is the current planning for a proposed\nHelioswarm mission that would be designed to make these measurements,leading to\nbreakthrough understanding of the physics of space and astrophysical\nturbulence.\n",

The coupled electromechanical virtual work equation for\nthe piezoelectric stack actuator in each active strut is derived by applying\nD'Alembert's principle to calculate the consistent mass matrix, the stiffness\nmatrix and the load vector using finite element approximation. Modal analysis\nis performed to characterize the inherent properties of the smart adapter and\nextraction of a mathematical model of the system.

The kinetic instabilities in the\nSW multi-ion plasma can lead to preferential heating of alpha particles and the\ndissipation of magnetic fluctuation energy, affecting the kinetic and global\nproperties of the SW. Using for the first time a three-dimensional hybrid\nmodel, where ions are modeled as particle using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC)\nmethod and electrons are treated as fluid, we study the onset, nonlinear\nevolution and dissipation of ion kinetic instabilities. The\nAlfven/ion-cyclotron, and the ion drift instabilities are modeled in the region\nclose to the Sun (~10R_s). Solar wind expansion is incorporated in the model.\nThe model produces self-consistent non-Maxwellian velocity distribution\nfunctions (VDFs) of unstable ion populations, the associated temperature\nanisotropies, and wave spectra for several typical SW instability cases in the\nnonlinear growth and saturation stage of the instabilities.

Here, calibration\nof several stable sealevel NMs (Inuvik, Apatity, Oulu, Newark, Moscow,\nHermanus, Athens) was performed using these spectra. Four modern NM yield\nfunctions were verified: Mi13 (Mishev et al., 2013), Ma16 (Mangeard et al.,\n2016), CM12 (Caballero-Lopez & Moraal, 2012) and CD00 (Clem & Dorman, 2000), on\nthe basis of the cosmic-ray spectra measured by AMS-02. The Mi13 yield function\nwas found to realistically represent the NM response to galactic cosmic rays.\nCM12 yield function leads to a small skew in the solar cycle dependence of the\nscaling factor. In contrast, Ma16 and CD00 yield functions tend to overestimate\nthe NM sensitivity to low-rigidity (<10 GV) cosmic rays. This effect may be\nimportant for an analysis of ground level enhancements, leading to a potential\nunderestimate of fluxes of solar energetic particles as based on NM data. The\nMi13 yield function is recommended for quantitative analyses of NM data,\nespecially for ground-level enhancements. The validity the force-field\napproximation was studied, and it was found that it fits well the directly\nmeasured proton spectra, within a few % for periods of low to moderate activity\nand up to ~10% for active periods. The results of this work strengthen and\nvalidate the method of the cosmic-ray variability analysis based on the NM data\nand yield-function formalism, and improves its accuracy.\n",

We analysed in-situ measurements\nprovided by the two Helios spacecrafts to study the behaviour of the last, the\nstrahl electron population, in the inner Solar system between 0.3 and 1 au. The\nstrahl is characterised with a pitch-angle width (PAW) depending on electron\nenergy and evolving with radial distance. We find different behaviour of the\nstrahl electrons for solar wind separated into types by the core electron beta\nparallel value ($\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$). For the low-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar\nwind the strahl component is more pronounced, and the variation of PAW is\nelectron energy dependent. At low energies a slight focusing over distance is\nobserved, and the strahl PAW measured at 0.34 au agrees with the width\npredicted by a collisionless focusing model. The broadening observed for\nhigher-energy strahl electrons during expansion can be described by an\nexponential relation, which points toward an energy dependent scattering\nmechanism. In the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar wind the strahl appears\nbroader in consistence with the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ plasma being more\nunstable with respect to kinetic instabilities. Finally we extrapolate our\nobservations to the distance of 0.16 au, predicting the strahl PAWs in the\nlow-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar wind to be $\\sim$ 29$^o$ for all energies, and\nin the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar wind a bit broader, ranging between\n37$^o$ and 65$^o$.\n",

We investigate here the structure and\nevolution of the three components of the solar large-scale magnetic field in\n2010 - 2017, covering the ascending to mid-declining phase of solar cycle 24,\nusing SOLIS/VSM vector synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field. We\ncompare the observed VSM vector magnetic field to the potential vector field\nderived using the VSM LOS magnetic field observations as an input. The new\nvector field data allow us to derive the meridional inclination and the azimuth\nangle of the magnetic field and to investigate their solar cycle evolution and\nlatitudinal profile of these quantities. SOLIS/VSM vector data show that the\nphotospheric magnetic field is in general fairly non-radial. In the meridional\nplane the field is inclined toward the equator, reflecting the dipolar\nstructure of the solar magnetic field. Rotationally averaged meridional\ninclination does not have significant solar cycle variation. While the vector\nradial component $B_r$ and the potential radial component $B_r^{PFSS}$ are\nfairly similar, the meridional and zonal components do not agree very well. We\nfind that SOLIS/VSM vector observations are noisy at high latitudes and suffer\nfrom the vantage point effect more than LOS observations.

Between late 2012 and\nmid-2017, three large-scale events occurred, lasting from ~100 to ~630 days.\nOmnidirectional and directional high-energy data from Voyager 1's Cosmic Ray\nSubsystem are used to report cosmic ray intensity variations.

Bi-directional (greater than ~70 MeV) proton-dominated\nmeasurements taken from various spacecraft orientations provide insight about\nthe depletion region's spatial properties. We characterize the anisotropy as a\n\"notch\" in an otherwise uniform pitch-angle distribution of varying depth and\nwidth centered about 90 degrees in pitch angle space. The notch averages 22-deg\nwide and 15% deep - signifying a depletion region that is broad and shallow.\nThere are indications that the anisotropy is formed by a combination of\nmagnetic trapping and cooling downstream of solar-induced transient\ndisturbances in a region that is also likely influenced by the highly\ncompressed fields near the heliopause.\n",

The highest-energy\nemission has generally been attributed to pion production from the interaction\nof >300 MeV protons with the ambient matter. The extended duration suggests\nthat particle acceleration occurs over large volumes extending high in the\ncorona, either from stochastic acceleration within large coronal loops or from\nback precipitation from coronal mass ejection driven shocks. It is possible to\ntest these models by making direct comparison between the properties of the\naccelerated ion population producing the gamma-ray emission derived from the\nFermi/LAT observations, and the characteristics of solar energetic particles\n(SEPs) measured by the Payload for Matter-Antimatter Exploration and Light\nNuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) spacecraft in the energy range corresponding to\nthe pion-related emission detected with Fermi. For fourteen of these events we\ncompare the two populations -- SEPs in space and the interacting particles at\nthe Sun -- and discuss the implications in terms of potential sources. Our\nanalysis shows that the two proton numbers are poorly correlated, with their\nratio spanning more than five orders of magnitude, suggesting that the back\nprecipitation of shock-acceleration particles is unlikely the source of the\nLDGRF emission.\n",

In particular, at $1$ AU, the magnetic field spectrum,\nobserved within fast corotating streams, also shows a clear steepening for\nfrequencies higher than the typical proton scales, of the order of $\\sim\n3\\times10^{-1}$ Hz, and a flattening towards $1/f$ at frequencies lower than\n$\\sim 10^{-3}$ Hz. However, the current literature reports observations of the\nlow-frequency break only for fast streams. Slow streams, as observed to date,\nhave not shown a clear break, and this has commonly been attributed to slow\nwind intervals not being long enough. Actually, because of the longer transit\ntime from the Sun, slow wind turbulence would be older and the frequency break\nwould be shifted to lower frequencies with respect to fast wind. Based on this\nhypothesis, we performed a careful search for long-lasting slow wind intervals\nthroughout $12$ years of Wind satellite measurements. Our search, based on\nstringent requirements not only on wind speed but also on the level of magnetic\ncompressibility and Alfv\\'enicity of the turbulent fluctuations, yielded $48$\nslow wind streams lasting longer than $7$ days. This result allowed us to\nextend our study to frequencies sufficiently low and, for the first time in the\nliterature, we are able to show that the $1/f$ magnetic spectral scaling is\nalso present in the slow solar wind, provided the interval is long enough.\nHowever, this is not the case for the slow wind velocity spectrum, which keeps\nthe typical Kolmogorov scaling throughout the analysed frequency range. After\nruling out the possible role of compressibility and Alfv\\'enicity for the 1/f\nscaling, a possible explanation in terms of magnetic amplitude saturation, as\nrecently proposed in the literature, is suggested.\n",

Currently, a nuclear\ndevice is the only means of deflecting large Potentially Hazardous Asteroids\n(PHAs) away from an Earth-impacting trajectory. The Enhanced Kinetic Impactor\n(EKI) concept is proposed to deflect large PHAs via maneuvering space rocks.\nFirst, an unmanned spacecraft is launched to rendezvous with an intermediate\nNear-Earth Asteroid (NEA). Then, more than one hundred tons of rocks are\ncollected from the NEA as the EKI. The NEA can also be captured as the EKI if\nthe NEA is very small. Finally, the EKI is maneuvered to impact the PHA at a\nhigh speed, resulting in a significant deflection of the PHA. For example, to\ndeflect Apophis, as much as 200 t of rocks could be collected from a NEA as the\nEKI based on existing engineering capabilities. The EKI can produce a velocity\nincrement (delta-v) of 39.81 mm/s in Apophis, thereby increasing the minimum\ngeocentric distance during the close encounter in 2029 by 1,866.93 km. This\nmission can be completed in 3.96 years with a propellant cost of 2.98 t.\nCompared with a classic kinetic impactor, the deflection distance can be\nincreased one order of magnitude. The EKI concept breaks through the limitation\nof the ground-based launch capability, which can significantly increase the\nmass of the impactor.

        "summary": "  Jupiter has the most energetic and complex radiation belts in our solar\nsystem. Their hazardous environment is the reason why so many spacecraft avoid\nrather than investigate them, and explains how they have kept many of their\nsecrets so well hidden, despite having been studied for decades. In this White\nPaper we argue why these secrets are worth unveiling. Jupiter's radiation belts\nand the vast magnetosphere that encloses them constitute an unprecedented\nphysical laboratory, suitable for both interdisciplinary and novel scientific\ninvestigations: from studying fundamental high energy plasma physics processes\nwhich operate throughout the universe, such as adiabatic charged particle\nacceleration and nonlinear wave-particle interactions; to exploiting the\nastrobiological consequences of energetic particle radiation. The in-situ\nexploration of the uninviting environment of Jupiter's radiation belts present\nus with many challenges in mission design, science planning, instrumentation\nand technology development. We address these challenges by reviewing the\ndifferent options that exist for direct and indirect observation of this unique\nsystem. We stress the need for new instruments, the value of synergistic Earth\nand Jupiter-based remote sensing and in-situ investigations, and the vital\nimportance of multi-spacecraft, in-situ measurements. While simultaneous,\nmulti-point in-situ observations have long become the standard for exploring\nelectromagnetic interactions in the inner solar system, they have never taken\nplace at Jupiter or any strongly magnetized planet besides Earth. We conclude\nthat a dedicated multi-spacecraft mission to Jupiter's radiation belts is an\nessential and obvious way forward and deserves to be given a high priority in\nESA's Voyage 2050 programme.\n",

It has been found that the two approaches compare\npretty well, especially for the spectral properties of the magnetic field and\nthe ion diffusion statistics. Small differences among the models have been\nfound regarding the electric field behaviour at sub-ion scales and the\nacceleration statistics, due evidently to the more consistent treatment of the\nplasma in the full PIC approach.\n",

The first session\naddressed the topic of working with space weather service providers now and in\nthe future, the user perspective. The second session provided the service\nperspective, addressing experiences in forecasting development and operations.\nPresentations in both sessions provided an overview of international efforts on\nthese topics, and panel discussion topics arising in the first session were\nused as a basis for panel discussion in the second session. Discussion topics\nincluded experiences during the September 2017 space weather events, cross\ndomain impacts, timeliness of notifications, and provision of effective user\neducation. Users highlighted that a 'severe' space weather event did not\nnecessarily lead to severe impacts for each individual user across the\ndifferent sectors. Service providers were generally confident that timely and\nreliable information could be provided during severe and extreme events,\nalthough stressed that more research and funding were required in this\nrelatively new field of operational space weather forecasting, to ensure\ncontinuation of capabilities and further development of services, in particular\nimproved forecasting targeting user needs.

In this paper, we present a two-fluid model for fast solar wind\nwith anisotropic Kappa-Maxwellian electrons and Bi-Maxwellian protons. In the\nsimulation, the energy exchange between the plasma particles and low-frequency\nAlfv\\'en waves is considered. A set of eleven coupled equations is derived by\napplying the zeroth- to fourth-order moments of the Vlasov equation and the\nmodified electromagnetic Maxwell equations. A characteristic of the Kappa\ndistribution (indicated by $\\kappa$ index) is explicit in the equation for the\nparallel component of the electron heat flux (parallel to the ambient magnetic\nfield line) and differs from the equation derived for the proton heat flux due\nto the different nature of the distributions. Within the large $\\kappa$ index,\nthe equations for the two-fluid model tend to the equations obtained by the\nMaxwellian distribution. Using an iterated Crank-Nicolson method, the coupled\nequations are numerically solved for the fast solar wind conditions. We show\nthat at (0.3 - 1) AU from the Sun, the electron density, components of\ntemperature, and components of heat flux follow the power-law behavior. We also\nshowed that near the Earth, the flow speed (electron or proton) increases with\ndecreasing $\\kappa$. We concluded that applying the small $\\kappa$ index (the\nnon-Maxwellian distribution), the extraordinary nature of the solar atmosphere,\nwith its temperature of several million kelvin temperature for electrons, has\nbeen captured.\n",

This represents an alternative to the normal LPF\nmode of operation in which this balancing force is applied continuously, with\nthe advantage that the acceleration noise during free fall is measured in the\nabsence of the actuation force, thus eliminating associated noise and force\ncalibration errors. The differential acceleration noise measurement presented\nhere with the free-fall mode agrees with noise measured with the continuous\nactuation scheme, representing an important and independent confirmation of the\nLPF result. An additional measurement with larger actuation forces also shows\nthat the technique can be used to eliminate actuation noise when this is a\ndominant factor.\n",

The effects of the transmitted wave were\nseen by Voyager 1 just 93 days after its own heliopause crossing. The passage\nof the transient was accompanied by long-lasting decreases in galactic cosmic\nray intensities that occurred from ~2012.55 to ~2013.35 and ~2012.91 to\n~2013.70 at Voyager 2 and Voyager 1, respectively. Omnidirectional (>20 MeV)\nproton-dominated measurements from each spacecraft's Cosmic Ray Subsystem\nreveal a remarkable similarity between these causally-related events, with a\ncorrelation coefficient of 91.2% and a time-lag of 130 days. Knowing the\nlocations of the two spacecraft, we use the observed time-delay to calculate\nthe GMIR's average speed through the heliosheath (inside the heliopause) as a\nfunction of temperature in the very local interstellar medium. This, combined\nwith particle, field, and plasma observations enables us to infer previously\nunmeasured properties of the heliosheath, including a range of sound speeds and\ntotal effective pressures. For a nominal temperature of ~20,000 K just outside\nthe heliopause, we find a sound speed of 314 (+/-) 32 km/s and total effective\npressure of 267 (+/-) 55 fPa inside the heliopause. We compare these results\nwith the Interstellar Boundary Explorer's data-driven models of heliosheath\npressures derived from energetic neutral atom fluxes (the globally distributed\nflux) and present them as additional evidence that the heliosheath's dynamics\nare driven by suprathermal energetic processes.\n",

CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery\nAnd Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density data are used to compute orbital\ndrag. Storm-to-quiet density comparisons are performed with background\ndensities obtained by the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 (JB2008) empirical model. Our\nstorms are grouped in different categories regarding their intensities as\nindicated by minimum values of the SYM-H index. We then perform superposed\nepoch analyses with storm main phase onset as zero epoch time. In general, we\nfind that orbital drag effects are larger for CHAMP (lower altitudes) in\ncomparison to GRACE (higher altitudes). Results show that storm-time drag\neffects manifest first at high latitudes, but for extreme storms particularly\nobserved by GRACE stronger orbital drag effects occur during early main phase\nat low/equatorial latitudes, probably due to heating propagation from high\nlatitudes. We find that storm-time orbital decay along the satellites' path\ngenerally increases with storm intensity, being stronger and faster for the\nmost extreme events. For these events, orbital drag effects decrease faster\nprobably due to elevated cooling effects caused by nitric oxide, which\nintroduce modeled density uncertainties during storm recovery phase. Errors\nassociated with total orbit decay introduced by JB2008 are generally the\nlargest for the strongest storms, and increase during storm times, particular\nduring recovery phases. We discuss the implication of these uncertainties for\nthe prediction of collision between space objects at LEO during magnetic\nstorms.\n",

The end users may not be able to optimize\nsatellite orbits and constellations, however, they can optimize locations of\nground stations which aggregate terrestrial traffic and inter-connect with\nover-passing satellites. Such optimization requires a model of satellite\nvisibility to decide when the satellite becomes visible to the ground station\nin a given geographical location. Our model assumes ideal Kepler orbits\nparameterized by six orbital elements to describe the satellite movements. The\nsteps of Kepler orbit modeling are presented in detail to enable other studies\nrequiring geometric representation of satellite trajectories in the 3D space or\ntheir 2D footprint on the Earth surface. The long-term mean time satellite\nvisibility (MTSV) metric is defined to measure satellite visibility at a given\nground station. Numerical results reveal that efficiency of optimizing the\nground station locations is dependent on the satellite orbit and other\nsatellite visibility constraints. The ground station location optimization is\nespecially important when MTSV is improved by orthogonal time sharing schemes\nusing multiple satellites on the same or different orbits.

These\noscillations are readily apparent despite the high degree of axi-symmetry in\nthe internally produced magnetic field of the planet, and have different\nrotation periods in the northern and southern hemispheres. In this paper we\nstudy the spatial structure of (near-) planetary period magnetic field\noscillations in Saturn's equatorial magnetosphere. Extending previous analyses\nof these phenomena, we include all suitable data from the entire Cassini\nmission during its orbital tour of the planet, so as to be able to quantify\nboth the amplitude and phase of these field oscillations throughout Saturn's\nequatorial plane, to distances of 30 planetary radii. We study the structure of\nthese field oscillations in view of both independently rotating northern and\nsouthern systems, finding spatial variations in both magnetic fields and\ninferred currents flowing north-south that are common to both systems. With the\ngreatly expanded coverage of the equatorial plane achieved during the latter\nyears of the mission, we are able to present a complete survey of dawn-dusk and\nday-night asymmetries in the structure of the oscillating fields and currents.\nWe show that the general structure of the rotating currents is simpler than\npreviously reported, and that the relatively enhanced nightside equatorial\nfields and currents are due in part to related periodic vertical motion of\nSaturn's magnetotail current sheet.\n",

This\nupdated model, called PreMevE 2.0, is demonstrated to make much improved\nforecasts, particularly at outer Lshells, by including upstream solar wind\nspeeds to the model's input parameter list. Furthermore, based on several kinds\nof linear and artificial machine learning algorithms, a list of models were\nconstructed, trained, validated and tested with 42-month MeV electron\nobservations from Van Allen Probes. Out-of-sample test results from these\nmodels show that, with optimized model hyperparameters and input parameter\ncombinations, the top performer from each category of models has the similar\ncapability of making reliable 1-day (2-day) forecasts with Lshell-averaged\nperformance efficiency values ~ 0.87 (~0.82). Interestingly, the linear\nregression model is often the most successful one when compared to other\nmodels, which indicates the relationship between 1 MeV electron dynamics and\nprecipitating electrons is dominated by linear components. It is also shown\nthat PreMevE 2.0 can reasonably predict the onsets of MeV electron events in\n2-day forecasts. This improved PreMevE model is driven by observations from\nlongstanding space infrastructure (a NOAA satellite in low-Earth-orbit, the\nsolar wind monitor at the L1 point, and one LANL satellite in geosynchronous\norbit) to make high-fidelity forecasts for MeV electrons, and thus can be an\ninvaluable space weather forecasting tool for the future.\n",

        "summary": "  Interstellar neutral atoms provide a remote diagnostic of plasma in the outer\nheliosheath and the very local interstellar medium via charge exchange\ncollisions that convert ions into atoms and vice versa. So far, most studies of\ninterstellar atoms assumed that daughter hydrogen atoms directly inherit the\nkinetic properties of parent protons. This assumption neglects angular\nscattering of the interacting particles. However, for low relative velocities,\nas expected for charge exchanges in the outer heliosheath, this scattering is\nsignificant. In this study, we present how the parameters of daughter\npopulations depend on the relative velocity and temperatures of parent\npopulations. For this purpose, we numerically compute collision terms with and\nwithout this scattering. We find that the secondary population of interstellar\nhydrogen atoms, for the parent populations with the relative bulk velocity of\n20 km s$^{-1}$ and equal temperatures of 7500 K, has ~2 km s$^{-1}$ higher bulk\nvelocity if the scattering is taken into account. Additionally, temperatures\nare higher by ~2400 K and ~1200 K in parallel and perpendicular direction to\nthe relative motion of parent populations, respectively. Moreover, a\nsignificant departure of secondary atoms from the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution is expected for high relative velocities of parent populations.\nThis process affects the distribution and density of interstellar atoms in the\nheliosphere and production of pickup ions. Thus, we show that angular\nscattering in charge exchange collisions is important to include in analyses of\ninterstellar neutral atoms and pickup ions observed at 1 au and in the outer\nheliosphere.\n",

Recent studies of ground level enhancements (GLEs), regular\nlarge solar energetic particle (SEP) events and filament eruption (FE)\nassociated large SEP events have shown that SEP events are organized by\nspectral index of proton fluence spectra and by the average starting\nfrequencies of the associated type II radio bursts. Both these results indicate\na hierarchical relationship between CME kinematics and SEP event properties. In\nthis study, we expand the investigations to fluence spectra and the\nlongitudinal extent of metric type II associated SEP events including\nlow-intensity SEP events. We utilize SEP measurements of particle instruments\non the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft together with radio bursts\nobservations by ground-based radio observatories during solar cycle 24. Our\nresults show that low-intensity SEP events follow the hierarchy of spectral\nindex or the hierarchy of the starting frequency of type II radio bursts. We\nalso find indications of a trend between the onset frequency of metric type II\nbursts and the estimated longitudinal extent of the SEP events although the\nscatter of data points is quite large.

Fast CMEs that drive\nshocks cause large FDs that often show a two-step decrease where the first step\nis attributed to the shock/sheath region, while the second step is attributed\nto the closed magnetic structure. Since the difference in size of shock and\nsheath region is significant, and since there are observed effects that can be\nrelated to shocks and not necessarily to the sheath region we expect that the\nphysical mechanisms governing the interaction with GCRs in these two regions\nare different. We therefore aim to analyse interaction of GCRs with\nheliospheric shocks only. We approximate the shock by a structure where the\nmagnetic field linearly changes with position within this structure. We assume\nprotons of different energy, different pitch angle and different incoming\ndirection. We also vary the shock parameters such as the magnetic field\nstrength and orientation, as well as the shock thickness. The results\ndemonstrate that protons with higher energies are less likely to be reflected.\nAlso, thicker shocks and shocks with stronger field reflect protons more\nefficiently.\n",

We further demonstrate\nthe applicability of this model to simulations of CME-CME collisions. Finally,\nwe use this model to simulate the 12 July 2012 CME and compare the plasma\nproperties at 1 AU with observations. The predicted CME properties agree\nreasonably with observational data.\n",

They were called\nswitchbacks as some of them show up the full reversal of the radial component\nof the magnetic field and then return to regular conditions. Analyzing the\nmagnetic field and plasma perturbations associated with switchbacks we identify\nthree types of structures with slightly different characteristics: 1. Alfvenic\nstructures, where the variations of the magnetic field components take place\nwhile the magnitude of the field remains constant; 2. Compressional, the field\nmagnitude varies together with changes of the components; 3. Structures\nmanifesting full reversal of the magnetic field (extremal class of Alfvenic\nstructures). Processing of structures boundaries and plasma bulk velocity\nperturbations lead to the conclusion that they represent localized magnetic\nfield tubes with enhanced parallel plasma velocity and ion beta moving together\nwith respect to surrounding plasma. The magnetic field deflections before and\nafter the switchbacks reveal the existence of total axial current. The electric\ncurrents are concentrated on the relatively narrow boundary layers on the\nsurface of the tubes and determine the magnetic field perturbations inside the\ntube. These currents are closed on the structure surface, and typically have\ncomparable azimuthal and the axial components. The surface of the structure may\nalso accommodate an electromagnetic wave, that assists to particles in carrying\ncurrents. We suggest that the two types of structures we analyzed here may\nrepresent the local manifestations of the tube deformations corresponding to a\nsaturated stage of the Firehose instability development.\n",

Using the 2D improved Particle Acceleration and Transport in the\nHeliosphere (iPATH) model, we model the large solar energetic particle (SEP)\nevent of 10 September 2017 observed at Earth, Mars and STEREO-A. Based on\nobservational evidence,we assume that the CME-driven shock experienced a large\nlateral expansion shortly after the eruption, which is modelled by a double\nGaussian velocity profile in this simulation. We use the in-situ shock arrival\ntimes and the observed CME speeds at multiple spacecraft near Earth and Mars as\nconstraints to adjust the input model parameters. The modelled time intensity\nprofiles and fluence for energetic protons are then compared with observations.\nReasonable agreements with observations at Mars and STEREO-A are found. The\nsimulated results at Earth differ from observations of GOES-15. Instead, the\nsimulated results at a heliocentric longitude 20 degree west to Earth fit\nreasonably well with the GOES observation. This can be explained if the\npre-event solar wind magnetic field at Earth is not described by a nominal\nParker field. Our results suggest that a large lateral expansion of the\nCME-driven shock and a distorted interplanetary magnetic field due to previous\nevents can be important in understanding this GLE event.\n",

From its first encounter\nobservations, about 55.3\\% of the slow solar wind inside 0.25 au is highly\nAlfv\\'enic ($|\\sigma_C| > 0.7$) at current solar minimum, which is much higher\nthan the fraction of quiet-Sun-associated highly Alfv\\'enic slow wind observed\nat solar maximum at 1 au. Intervals of slow solar wind with different\nAlfv\\'enicities seem to show similar plasma characteristics and temperature\nanisotropy distributions. Some low Alfv\\'enicity slow wind intervals even show\nhigh temperature anisotropies, because the slow wind may experience\nperpendicular heating as fast wind does when close to the Sun. This signature\nis confirmed by Wind spacecraft measurements as we track PSP observations to 1\nau. Further, with nearly 15 years of Wind measurements, we find that the\ndistributions of plasma characteristics, temperature anisotropy and helium\nabundance ratio ($N_\\alpha/N_p$) are similar in slow winds with different\nAlfv\\'enicities, but the distributions are different from those in the fast\nsolar wind. Highly Alfv\\'enic slow solar wind contains both helium-rich\n($N_\\alpha/N_p\\sim0.045$) and helium-poor ($N_\\alpha/N_p\\sim0.015$)\npopulations, implying it may originate from multiple source regions. These\nresults suggest that highly Alfv\\'enic slow solar wind shares similar\ntemperature anisotropy and helium abundance properties with regular slow solar\nwinds, and they thus should have multiple origins.\n",

With new limits\non the Jovian source function (i.e. the particle intensity just outside the\nJovian magnetosphere), and a new set of in-situ observations at 1 AU for both\ncases of good and poor magnetic connection between the source and observer, we\nrevisit some of these earlier simulations.

Using such a set-up, we further aim to study the\nresidence (propagation) times of these particles for different levels of\nmagnetic connection between Jupiter and an observer at Earth (1 AU). Using an\nadvanced Jovian electron propagation model based on the stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) approach, we calculate the Jovian electron intensity for\ndifferent model parameters. A comparison with observations leads to an optimal\nnumerical set-up, which is then used to calculate the so-called residence\n(propagation) times of these particles. Comparing to in-situ observations, we\nare able to derive transport parameters that are appropriate to study the\npropagation of 6 MeV Jovian electrons in the inner heliosphere. Moreover, using\nthese values, we show that the method of calculating the residence time applied\nin former literature is not suited to being interpreted as the propagation time\nof physical particles. This is due to an incorrect weighting of the probability\ndistribution. We propose and apply a new method, where the results from each\npseudo-particle are weighted by its resulting phase-space density (i.e. the\nnumber of physical particles that it represents). Thereby we obtain more\nreliable estimates for the propagation time.\n",

With a multitude of flare forecasting methods now\navailable online it is still unclear which of these methods performs best, and\nnone are substantially better than climatological forecasts. Space weather\nresearchers are increasingly looking towards methods used by the terrestrial\nweather community to improve current forecasting techniques. Ensemble\nforecasting has been used in numerical weather prediction for many years as a\nway to combine different predictions in order to obtain a more accurate result.\nHere we construct ensemble forecasts for major solar flares by linearly\ncombining the full-disk probabilistic forecasts from a group of operational\nforecasting methods (ASAP, ASSA, MAG4, MOSWOC, NOAA, and MCSTAT). Forecasts\nfrom each method are weighted by a factor that accounts for the method's\nability to predict previous events, and several performance metrics (both\nprobabilistic and categorical) are considered. It is found that most ensembles\nachieve a better skill metric (between 5\\% and 15\\%) than any of the members\nalone. Moreover, over 90\\% of ensembles perform better (as measured by forecast\nattributes) than a simple equal-weights average. Finally, ensemble\nuncertainties are highly dependent on the internal metric being optimized and\nthey are estimated to be less than 20\\% for probabilities greater than 0.2.\nThis simple multi-model, linear ensemble technique can provide operational\nspace weather centres with the basis for constructing a versatile ensemble\nforecasting system -- an improved starting point to their forecasts that can be\ntailored to different end-user needs.\n",

Despite its importance in predictive investigations of the\nmagnetosphere - ionosphere coupling, the estimation of ionospheric conductance\nin the auroral region is precarious in most global first-principles based\nmodels. This impreciseness in estimating the auroral conductance impedes both\nour understanding and predictive capabilities of the magnetosphere-ionosphere\nsystem during extreme space weather events. In this article, we address this\nconcern, with the development of an advanced Conductance Model for Extreme\nEvents (CMEE) that estimates the auroral conductance from field aligned current\nvalues. CMEE has been developed using nonlinear regression over a year's worth\nof one-minute resolution output from assimilative maps, specifically including\ntimes of extreme driving of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The\nmodel also includes provisions to enhance the conductance in the aurora using\nadditional adjustments to refine the auroral oval. CMEE has been incorporated\nwithin the Ridley Ionosphere Model (RIM) of the Space Weather Modeling\nFramework (SWMF) for usage in space weather simulations. This paper compares\nperformance of CMEE against the existing conductance model in RIM, through a\nvalidation process for six space weather events. The performance analysis\nindicates overall improvement in the ionospheric feedback to ground-based space\nweather forecasts. Specifically, the model is able to improve the prediction of\nionospheric currents which impact the simulated dB/dt and {\\Delta}B, resulting\nin substantial improvements in dB/dt predictive skill.\n",

The source solar eruption at 09:29 - 09:38 GMT on 28\nFebruary was located at RGO AR 13814 and its significant intensity is confirmed\nby large magnetic crochets of 35 nT measured at Abinger. This solar eruption\nmost likely released a fast interplanetary coronal mass ejection with estimated\nspeed 2260 km/s. After its impact at 03:57 - 03:59 GMT on 1 March, an extreme\nmagnetic storm was recorded worldwide. Comparative analyses on the contemporary\nmagnetograms show the storm peak intensity of minimum Dst* < -464 nT at 16 GMT,\ncomparable to the most and the second most extreme magnetic storms within the\nstandard Dst index since 1957. This storm triggered significant low-latitude\naurorae in the East Asian sector and their equatorward boundary has been\nreconstructed as 38.5{\\deg} in invariant latitude. This result agrees with\nBritish magnetograms which indicate auroral oval moving above Abinger at\n53.0{\\deg} in magnetic latitude. The storm amplitude was even more enhanced in\nequatorial stations and consequently casts caveats on their usage for\nmeasurements of the storm intensity in Dst estimates.\n",

Previous observations provide diverse results and the\nstructure function analyses are also reported to be an approach to investigate\nthe scaling anisotropy based on a local magnetic field. However, the\ndetermination of the sampling angle with respect to the local background\nmagnetic field requires that the observed time series for the average are time\nstationary. Whether or not this required time stationarity is compatible with\nthe measurements has not been investigated. Here we utilize the second-order\nstructure function method to study the scaling anisotropy with a\ntime-stationary background field.We analyze 88 fast solar wind intervals each\nwith time durations larger than 2 days measured by WIND spacecraft in the\nperiod 2005-2018. We calculate the local magnetic field as the average of the\ntime series B whose time stationarity is fulfilled by our criterion phi smaller\nthan 10 deg (phi is the angle between the two averaged magnetic fields after\ncutting B into two halves). We find for the first time the isotropic scaling\nfeature of the magnetic-trace structure functions with scaling indices -0.63 pm\n0.08 and -0.70 pm 0.04, respectively, with the local magnetic field parallel\nand perpendicular to the solar wind velocity directions. The scaling for the\nvelocity-trace structure functions is also isotropic and the indices are -0.47\npm 0.10 and -0.51 pm 0.09. We also find that with increasing phi threshold to\n90 deg, the scaling index of the magnetic-trace structure function in the\nparallel direction decreases to -0.81, while the rms of the instantaneous angle\nbetween magnetic field and solar wind velocity increases up to 45deg at the\ntimescale 150 s, indicating a mix of perpendicular measurements into parallel\nones at large scales.\n",

The CME was later observed\nin situ on April 20th by the Wind and BepiColombo spacecraft whilst BepiColombo\nwas located very close to Earth. This CME presents a good opportunity for a\ntriple radial alignment study, as the spacecraft were separated by less than\n5$^\\circ$ in longitude. The source of the CME, which was launched on April\n15th, was an almost entirely isolated streamer blowout. STEREO-A observed the\nevent remotely from -75.1$^\\circ$ longitude, which is an exceptionally well\nsuited viewpoint for heliospheric imaging of an Earth directed CME. The\nconfiguration of the four spacecraft has provided an exceptionally clean link\nbetween remote imaging and in situ observations of the CME. We have used the in\nsitu observations of the CME at Solar Orbiter, Wind, and BepiColombo, and the\nremote observations of the CME at STEREO-A in combination with flux rope models\nto determine the global shape of the CME and its evolution as it propagated\nthrough the inner heliosphere. A clear flattening of the CME cross-section has\nbeen observed by STEREO-A, and further confirmed by comparing profiles of the\nflux rope models to the in situ data, where the distorted flux rope\ncross-section qualitatively agrees most with in situ observations of the\nmagnetic field at Solar Orbiter. Comparing in situ observations of the magnetic\nfield between spacecraft, we find that the dependence of the maximum (mean)\nmagnetic field strength decreases with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.24 \\pm\n0.50}$ ($r^{-1.12 \\pm 0.14}$), in disagreement with previous studies. Further\nassessment of the axial and poloidal magnetic field strength dependencies\nsuggests that the expansion of the CME is likely neither self-similar nor\ncylindrically symmetric.\n",

Theoretical evidence of internal\nshocks is significant, as these are required to explain high energy tail of the\nspectra of radio sources. Under thermal and radiative driving, jets with\nelectron-positron composition are obtained to be achieving relativistic speeds\nup to Lorentz factors $\\gamma \\sim 10$ while for electron-proton composition it\nis $\\gamma \\sim 2$ for luminous discs. We also showed that extragalactic jets\naround AGNs are faster than those around microquasars.

Further, we obtained transonic solutions with relativistic terminal\nspeeds, for bound state of the jet at the base (that is, generalized Bernoulli\nparameter $E < 1$), where gravity is dominant over thermal driving. In Thomson\nscattering regime no transonic solutions could be obtained.

These extreme values were estimated for\none-in-40 and one-in-80 years events, which represent two and four times the\nrange of the original data set. The estimated values were verified by\ncomparison with measured values of extreme events recorded in previous years.\nFinally, our research also suggests the presence of an upper boundary in the\nmagnitudes under study.\n",

Generally, an ICME\ncauses high amplitude FDs and extreme GSs. However, the interlinks between\nextreme GS and strong FDs are poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate five ICME\ninduced extreme storms and their effects on respective FD profiles. We observed\nthe sudden storm commencement of the GS coincides with the FD onset.\nInterestingly, we also noted a gradual increase in neutron counts during the\nmain and recovery phases of GS. The maximum enhancement in neutron counts\ncoincides with the minimum value of the Sym-H index. The enhancement is visible\nprimarily in all the neutron monitors but significantly pronounced in\nhigh-energy neutrons compared to low-energy neutrons. The weakening of Earth's\nmagnetic shield due to ICME-Magnetosphere interaction allows more cosmic rays\nto reach the ground. Thus, we conclude that the geomagnetic storm conditions\nhighly influence the FD profile along with the external causing agent.\nTherefore, it is essential to include the effect of geomagnetic field variation\nin the models that are used to reproduce the FD profile.\n",

The current main goals are to identify\nsources of UHECRs and their composition. For this, increased statistics is\nrequired. A space-based detector for UHECR research has the advantage of a very\nlarge exposure and a uniform coverage of the celestial sphere. The aim of the\nJEM-EUSO program is to bring the study of UHECRs to space. The principle of\nobservation is based on the detection of UV light emitted by isotropic\nfluorescence of atmospheric nitrogen excited by the Extensive Air Showers (EAS)\nin the Earth's atmosphere and forward-beamed Cherenkov radiation reflected from\nthe Earth's surface or dense cloud tops. In addition to the prime objective of\nUHECR studies, JEMEUSO will do several secondary studies due to the\ninstruments' unique capacity of detecting very weak UV-signals with extreme\ntime-resolution around 1 microsecond: meteors, Transient Luminous Events (TLE),\nbioluminescence, maps of human generated UV-light, searches for Strange Quark\nMatter (SQM) and high-energy neutrinos, and more. The JEM-EUSO program includes\nseveral missions from ground (EUSO-TA), from stratospheric balloons\n(EUSO-Balloon, EUSO-SPB1, EUSO-SPB2), and from space (TUS, Mini-EUSO) employing\nfluorescence detectors to demonstrate the UHECR observation from space and\nprepare the large size missions K-EUSO and POEMMA. A review of the current\nstatus of the program, the key results obtained so far by the different\nprojects, and the perspectives for the near future are presented.\n",

The FTE showers correspond to the\nintervals of intense magnetopause reconnection of Mercury's magnetosphere,\nwhich form a solar wind entry layer equatorward of the magnetospheric cusps. In\nthis entry layer, solar wind ions are accelerated and move downward (i.e.\nplanetward) toward the cusps, which sputter upward-moving planetary ions within\n1 minute. The precipitation rate is enhanced by an order of magnitude during\nFTE showers and the neutral density of the exosphere can vary by >10% due to\nthis FTE-driven sputtering. These in situ observations of enhanced planetary\nions in the entry layer likely correspond to an escape channel of Mercury's\nplanetary ions, and the large-scale variations of the exosphere observed on\nminute-timescales by Earth observatories.

The\nsimulation results illustrate both the capabilities and limitations of the\nutilised models. We show that the models capture some essential structural\nfeatures of the ESP event; however, for some aspects the simulations and\nobservations diverge. We describe and, to some extent, assess the sources of\nerrors in the modelling chain of EUHFORIA and PARADISE and discuss how they may\nbe mitigated in the future. The PARADISE model evolves energetic particle\ndistributions in a background solar wind generated by the ideal MHD module of\nEUHFORIA. The CME generating the ESP event is simulated by using the spheromak\nmodel of EUHFORIA, which approximates the CME's flux rope as a linear\nforce-free spheroidal magnetic field. In addition, a tool was developed to\ntrace CME-driven shock waves in the EUHFORIA simulation domain. This tool is\nused in PARADISE to (i) inject 50 keV protons continuously at the CME-driven\nshock and (ii) include a foreshock and a sheath region, in which the energetic\nparticle parallel mean free path, $\\lambda_\\parallel$, decreases towards the\nshock wave. The value of $\\lambda_\\parallel$ at the shock wave is estimated\nfrom in situ observations of the ESP event. For energies below 1 MeV, the\nsimulation results agree well with both the upstream and downstream components\nof the ESP event observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). This\nsuggests that these low-energy protons are mainly the result of interplanetary\nparticle acceleration. In the downstream region, the sharp drop in the\nenergetic particle intensities is reproduced at the entry into the following\nmagnetic cloud, illustrating the importance of a magnetised CME model.\n",

The most recent version of\nMSIS is the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) MSIS 2.0 empirical atmospheric\nmodel. NRLMSIS 2.0 provides species density, mass density, and temperature\nestimates as function of location and space weather conditions. MSIS models\nhave long been a popular choice of atmosphere model in the research and\noperations community alike, but - like many models - does not provide\nuncertainty estimates. In this work, we develop an exospheric temperature model\nbased in machine learning (ML) that can be used with NRLMSIS 2.0 to calibrate\nit relative to high-fidelity satellite density estimates. Instead of providing\npoint estimates, our model (called MSIS-UQ) outputs a distribution which is\nassessed using a metric called the calibration error score. We show that\nMSIS-UQ debiases NRLMSIS 2.0 resulting in reduced differences between model and\nsatellite density of 25% and is 11% closer to satellite density than the Space\nForce's High Accuracy Satellite Drag Model. We also show the model's\nuncertainty estimation capabilities by generating altitude profiles for species\ndensity, mass density, and temperature.

Extending this same diffusion dependence to high energies, still in a\nLBM, along with a truncation of short path lengths in the galaxy will predict a\nB/C ratio of 4.5% at ~800 GeV/nuc which is very close to the AMS-2 measurement\nat that energy. This would indicate that the amount of material traversed near\nthe source in a Nested LBM, for example, is less than about 0.5 g/cm2 at these\nenergies since this process, with additional matter near the sources, would\nincrease the B/C ratio. At low energies, however, the B/C ratio of 14% +3% at\n~10 MeV/nuc measured by Voyager is more difficult to explain. The same\nparameters used in a LBM that fit the high energy B/C measurements predicts a\nB/C ratio of only ~4% at 10 MeV/nuc where the path length is about 1.5 g/cm2.\nIf the cosmic rays have traversed ~10 g/cm2 of material in the galaxy at low\nenergies the prediction for B/C is still only 8%, which is between 2.0-3.0\nsigma below the measurement and its errors.\n",

The boundary between\nthese regions extends outward as the heliospheric current sheet (HCS).\nMeasurements of plasma composition imply that the solar wind near the HCS, the\nso-called slow solar wind, originates in closed regions, presumably by the\nprocesses of field-line opening or interchange reconnection. Mysteriously,\nhowever, slow wind is also often seen far from the HCS.

The technique developed, commonly called 'curlometer' permits a\ngood estimation of the current density when the magnetic field time series vary\nlinearly in space. This approximation is generally valid for small spacecraft\nseparation. The recent space missions Cluster and Magnetospheric Multiscale\n(MMS) have provided high resolution measurements with inter-spacecraft\nseparation up to 100 km and 10 km, respectively.

This\nmethod is an improvement of the one described in (Gronchi et al 2015), which\nuses a pure Keplerian dynamical model. Since the effect of the Earth oblateness\nis strong at low altitudes, its inclusion in the model can sensibly improve the\ninitial orbit, giving a better starting guess for differential corrections and\nincreasing the chances to obtain their convergence. The input set consists of\ntwo tracks of radar observations, each one composed of at least 4 observations\ntaken during the same pass of the satellite. A single observation gives the\ntopocentric position of the satellite, where the range is very accurate, while\nthe line of sight direction is poorly determined. From these data we can\ncompute by a polynomial fit the values of the range and range rate at the mean\nepochs of the two tracks. In order to obtain a preliminary orbit we wish to\ncompute the angular velocities, that is the rate of change of the line of\nsight. In the same spirit of (Gronchi et al 2015), we also wish to correct the\nvalues of the angular measurements, so that they fit the selected dynamical\nmodel if the same holds for the radial distance and velocity.

        "summary": "  The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from\nEarth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (~ 1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation\nspeed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of\nmagnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts cause the so-called\nForbush decrease, which can be de- tected as a reduction of galactic cosmic\nrays measured on-ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from\nin-situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and B as well as GCR\nmeasurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard Mars\nScience Laboratory (MSL) on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been\nselected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or B) and Mars locations\nwere nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane\n(so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs'\ntransit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the\ncorresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the\nevolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit\nand find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the\nambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial\nvariance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic\nand diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are\ncompared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely\nthe Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.\n",

However, the\nacceleration of near-relativistic electrons by shocks in the interplanetary\nmedium is often questioned. On 9 August 2011 a Corotating Interaction Region\n(CIR) passed STEREO B (STB) that resulted in a flux increase in the electron\nand ion channels of the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT). Because\nelectron measurements in the few keV to several 100 keV range rely on the\nso-called magnet foil technique, which is utilized by SEPT, ions can contribute\nto the electron channels. Aims. We aim to investigate whether the flux increase\nin the electron channels of SEPT during the CIR event on 9 August 2011 is\ncaused by ion contamination only. Methods. We compute the SEPT response\nfunctions for protons and helium utilizing an updated GEANT4 model of SEPT. The\nCIR energetic particle ion spectra for protons and helium are assumed to follow\na Band function in energy per nucleon with a constant helium to proton ratio.\nResults. Our analysis leads to a helium to proton ratio of 16.9% and a proton\nflux following a Band function with the parameters $I_0 = 1.24 \\cdot 10^4$ /\n(cm2 s sr MeV/nuc.), $E_c = 79$ keV/nuc. and spectral indices of $\\gamma_1 =\n-0.94$ and $\\gamma_2 = -3.80$ which are in good agreement with measurements by\nthe Suprathermal Ion Telescope (SIT) aboard STB.

The optical signatures and the densities of perturbed excited atomic and\nmolecular neutral and ionic species in the mesosphere of Venus are also\ncalcutated using a basic kinetic scheme. The calculations were performed for\ndifferent IC lightning discharge properties [Krasnopolsky (1980), Cosmic.\nRes.]. We found that the calculated electric fields in the mesosphere of Venus\nare above breakdown values and that, consequently, visible transient glows\n(similar to terrestrial Halos produced by lightning) right above the parent IC\nlightning are predicted. The transient optical emissions result from radiative\nde-excitation of excited electronic states of N$_2$ (in the ultraviolet,\nvisible and near infrared ranges) and of O($^{1}$S) and of O($^{1}$D) in,\nrespectively, the green (557 nm) and red (630 nm) wavelengths.

We report hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection statistics for\nall three locations. For all predicted CME arrivals, the hit rate is 0.5, and\nthe false alarm rate is 0.1. For the 273 events where the CME was predicted to\narrive at Earth, STEREO-A, or STEREO-B, and was actually observed (hit event),\nthe mean absolute arrival-time prediction error was 10.4 +/- 0.9 hours, with a\ntendency to early prediction error of -4.0 hours.

Furthermore, recent observations and historic data from Galileo\nhint at the occurrence of water vapour eruptions originating from the interior\nthat create 200 km high plumes. Due to the lack of adequate measurements large\nuncertainties exist in the properties of Europa's atmosphere (e.g. loss rate\nand structure) and plumes (e.g. structure, source location, duration), of the\nlatter one the existence is not even confirmed. Unexploited opportunities to\nconstrain properties of the atmosphere or plumes remain in the in-situ data\ncollected by the Galileo mission, the only mission that has surveyed Europa\nfrom close by. In this thesis, I investigate how to constrain the properties\n(density, scale height) of Europa's tenuous atmosphere and plumes, using data\nfrom the Galileo in-situ particle detector instruments (PLS, EPD). I simulate\nthe depletion of energetic protons and oxygen ions measured during the E12\nflyby. A Monte Carlo particle tracing method is used to simulate the particle\ntrajectories and determine where they are depleted: at the surface or in the\natmosphere. The simulations show that the depletions of energetic ions observed\nin the range 80 to 540 keV can be explained by charge exchange with neutral\natmospheric particles, but not by impact on the surface alone. This suggests\nthat an atmosphere must have been present during the E12 flyby. The simulations\nbest represent the sublimated component of the atmosphere and favour higher\nsurface densities than the literature, but are not sensitive to the scale\nheight. Furthermore, an additional depletion is visible very briefly in the\nenergetic protons with energies from 540 to 1040 keV. This feature could be\nconsistent with localized losses from a Europa plume, although such a solution\nis not unique.\n",

We present an analysis of eight energetic proton events\nobserved across the energy range of both instruments during PSP's first two\norbits in order to examine their combined energy spectra. Background\ncorrections are applied to help resolve spectral breaks between the two\ninstruments and are shown to be effective. In doing so we demonstrate that,\neven in the early stages of calibration, IS$\\odot$IS is capable of producing\nreliable spectral observations across broad energy ranges. In addition to\nmaking groundbreaking measurements very near the Sun, IS$\\odot$IS also\ncharacterizes energetic particle populations over a range of heliocentric\ndistances inside 1 au. During the first two orbits, IS$\\odot$IS observed\nenergetic particle events from a single corotating interaction region (CIR) at\nthree different distances from the Sun. The events are separated by two\nCarrington rotations and just 0.11 au in distance, however the relationship\nshown between proton intensities and proximity of the spacecraft to the source\nregion shows evidence of the importance of transport effects on observations of\nenergetic particles from CIRs. Future IS$\\odot$IS observations of similar\nevents over larger distances will help disentangle the effects of CIR-related\nacceleration and transport. We apply similar spectral analyses to the remaining\nfive events, including four that are likely related to stream interaction\nregions (SIRs) and one solar energetic particle (SEP) event.\n",

Our results show that the\nICME, as a large scale magnetic flux rope, possesses high magnetic helicity,\nvery low cross helicity, and highly negative residual energy, thus pointing to\na magnetic fluctuation dominated structure. Using the same technique, we also\nsearch for small-scale coherent magnetic flux rope structures during the period\nfrom 2018/10/22--2018/11/21, which are intrinsic to quasi-2D MHD turbulence in\nthe solar wind. Multiple structures with duration between 8 and 300 minutes are\nidentified from PSP in-situ spacecraft measurements. The location and scales of\nthese structures are characterized by wavelet spectrograms of the normalized\nreduced magnetic helicity, normalized cross helicity and normalized residual\nenergy. Transport theory suggests that these small-scale magnetic flux ropes\nmay contribute to the acceleration of charged particles through magnetic\nreconnection processes, and the dissipation of these structures may be\nimportant for understanding the coronal heating processes.\n",

        "summary": "  Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations during its first encounter at 35.7\n$R_\\odot$ have shown the presence of magnetic field lines which are strongly\nperturbed to the point that they produce local inversions of the radial\nmagnetic field, known as switchbacks. Their counterparts in the solar wind\nvelocity field are local enhancements in the radial speed, or jets, displaying\n(in all components) the velocity-magnetic field correlation typical of large\namplitude Alfv\\'en waves propagating away from the Sun. Switchbacks and radial\njets have previously been observed over a wide range of heliocentric distances\nby Helios, WIND and Ulysses, although they were prevalent in significantly\nfaster streams than seen at PSP. Here we study via numerical MHD simulations\nthe evolution of such large amplitude Alfv\\'enic fluctuations by including, in\nagreement with observations, both a radial magnetic field inversion and an\ninitially constant total magnetic pressure. Despite the extremely large\nexcursion of magnetic and velocity fields, switchbacks are seen to persist for\nup to hundreds of Alfv\\'en crossing times before eventually decaying due to the\nparametric decay instability. Our results suggest that such switchback/jet\nconfigurations might indeed originate in the lower corona and survive out to\nPSP distances, provided the background solar wind is sufficiently calm, in the\nsense of not being pervaded by strong density fluctuations or other gradients,\nsuch as stream or magnetic field shears, that might destabilize or destroy them\nover shorter timescales.\n",

Waiting times\nlonger than this characteristic time are better described by an exponential,\nsuggesting a random memory-less Poisson process at play.

A lunar near side array would be uniquely positioned to image\nthis emission and provide a near real time measure of how the Earth's radiation\nbelts are responding to the current solar input. The Salammbo code is a\nphysical model of the dynamics of the three-dimensional phase-space electron\ndensities in the radiation belts, allowing the prediction of 1 keV to 100 MeV\nelectron distributions trapped in the belts. This information is put into a\nsynchrotron emission simulator which provides the brightness distribution of\nthe emission up to 1 MHz from a given observation point. Using Digital\nElevation Models from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lunar Orbiter Laser\nAltimeter (LOLA) data, we select a set of locations near the Lunar sub-Earth\npoint with minimum elevation variation over various sized patches where we\nsimulate radio receivers to create a synthetic aperture. We consider all\nrealistic noise sources in the low frequency regime. We then use a custom CASA\ncode to image and process the data from our defined array, using SPICE to align\nthe lunar coordinates with the Earth.

Most of this wave\npower is concentrated in electric field fluctuations near 0.7 f_ce and f_ce,\nwith strong harmonics of both frequencies extending above f_ce.

The\nbroad features of the distributions are similar to previous observations made\nby HELIOS in slow solar wind, namely well correlated and fairly Alfv\\'enic,\nexcept for a population with negative cross helicity which is seen at shorter\nwavelet scales. We show that this population is due to the presence of magnetic\nswitchbacks, brief periods where the magnetic field polarity reverses. Such\nswitchbacks have been observed before, both in HELIOS data and in Ulysses data\nin the polar solar wind. Their abundance and short timescales as seen by PSP in\nits first encounter is a new observation, and their precise origin is still\nunknown. By analysing these MHD invariants as a function of wavelet scale we\nshow that MHD waves do indeed follow the local mean magnetic field through\nswitchbacks, with net Elsasser flux propagating inward during the field\nreversal, and that they therefore must be local kinks in the magnetic field and\nnot due to small regions of opposite polarity on the surface of the Sun. Such\nobservations are important to keep in mind as computing cross helicity without\ntaking into account the effect of switchbacks may result in spurious\nunderestimation of $\\sigma_c$ as PSP gets closer to the Sun in later orbits.\n",

During this\ntime, the Energetic particle Instrument-Hi (EPI-Hi, one of the two energetic\nparticle instruments comprising the Integrated Science Investigation of the\nSun, ISOIS) measured seven proton intensity increases associated with stream\ninteraction regions (SIRs), two of which appear to be occurring in the same\nregion corotating with the Sun. The events are relatively weak, with observed\nproton spectra extending to only a few MeV and lasting for a few days. The\nproton spectra are best characterized by power laws with indices ranging from\n-4.3 to -6.5, generally softer than events associated with SIRs observed at 1\nau and beyond. Helium spectra were also obtained with similar indices, allowing\nHe/H abundance ratios to be calculated for each event. We find values of\n0.016-0.031, which are consistent with ratios obtained previously for\ncorotating interaction region events with fast solar wind < 600 km s-1. Using\nthe observed solar wind data combined with solar wind simulations, we study the\nsolar wind structures associated with these events and identify additional\nspacecraft near 1 au appropriately positioned to observe the same structures\nafter some corotation. Examination of the energetic particle observations from\nthese spacecraft yields two events that may correspond to the energetic\nparticle increases seen by EPI-Hi earlier.\n",

The TDS electric\nfields were bipolar, as expected for electron holes.

The solar wind does not receive a net acceleration from switchbacks that\nit encountered upstream of the observation point. The typical switchback\nrotation angle increased with radial distance. Significant Poynting fluxes\nexisted inside, but not outside, switchbacks and they are related to the\nincreased EXB/B2 flow caused by the magnetic field rotating to become more\nperpendicular to the flow direction. (Outside the switchbacks, the magnetic\nfield and solar wind flow were generally radial.) The solar wind flow inside\nswitchbacks was faster than that outside due to the frozen-in ions moving with\nthe magnetic structure at the Alfven speed. This energy gain results from the\ndivergence of the Poynting flux from outside to inside the switchback, which\nproduces a loss of electromagnetic energy on switchback entry and recovery of\nthat energy on exit, with the lost energy appearing in the plasma flow.\nSwitchbacks contain 0.3-10 Hz waves that may result from currents and the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability that occurs at the switchback boundaries. These\nwaves may combine with lower frequency MHD waves to heat the plasma. The radial\ndecreases of the Poynting flux and solar wind speed inside switchbacks are due\nto a geometrical effect.\n",

It has also been suggested that inverted HMF may be produced by\nnear-Sun interchange reconnection; a key process in mechanisms proposed for\nslow solar wind release. These cases suggest that the source of inverted HMF is\nnear the Sun, and it follows that these inversions would gradually decay and\nstraighten as they propagate out through the heliosphere. Alternatively, HMF\ninversions could form during solar wind transit, through phenomena such\nvelocity shears, draping over ejecta, or waves and turbulence.

Using Helios measurements spanning 0.3-1 AU, we examine the\noccurrence rate of inverted HMF, as well as other magnetic field morphologies,\nas a function of radial distance A, and find that it continually increases.\nThis trend may be explained by inverted HMF observed between 0.3-1 AU being\nprimarily driven by one or more of the above in-transit processes, rather than\ncreated at the Sun.

Statistical studies that focus on these and other MP phenomena and\ncharacteristics inherently require MP identification in their event search\ncriteria, a task that can be automated using machine learning.

As its first\napplication, the LSTM has been implemented into the operational data stream of\nthe Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. MMS focuses on the electron\ndiffusion region of reconnection, where electron dynamics break magnetic field\nlines and plasma is energized. MMS employs automated burst triggers onboard the\nspacecraft and a Scientist-in-the-Loop (SITL) on the ground to select intervals\nlikely to contain diffusion regions. Only low-resolution data is available to\nthe SITL, which is insufficient to resolve electron dynamics. A strategy for\nthe SITL, then, is to select all MP crossings. Of all 219 SITL selections\nclassified as MP crossings during the first five months of model operations,\nthe model predicted 166 (76%) of them, and of all 360 model predictions, 257\n(71%) were selected by the SITL.

Current state-of-the-art forecast models\nprovide deterministic $\\text{K}_\\text{p}$ predictions using a variety of\nmethods -- including empirically-derived functions, physics-based models, and\nneural networks -- but do not provide uncertainty estimates associated with the\nforecast.

Specifically, we have used a\ntwo-layered architecture to separately predict storm ($\\text{K}_\\text{p}\\geq\n5^-$) and non-storm cases. As solar wind-driven models are limited in their\nability to predict the onset of transient-driven activity we also introduce a\nmodel variant using solar X-ray flux to assess whether simple models including\nproxies for solar activity can improve the predictions of geomagnetic storm\nactivity with lead times longer than the L1-to-Earth propagation time. By\ncomparing the performance of these models we show that including\noperationally-available information about solar irradiance enhances the ability\nof predictive models to capture the onset of geomagnetic storms and that this\ncan be achieved while also enabling probabilistic forecasts.\n",

        "summary": "  Small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SFRs) are a type of structures in the solar\nwind that possess helical magnetic field lines. In a recent report (Chen & Hu\n2020), we presented the radial variations of the properties of SFR from 0.29 to\n8 au using in situ measurements from the Helios, ACE/Wind, Ulysses, and Voyager\nspacecraft. With the launch of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we extend our\nprevious investigation further into the inner heliosphere. We apply a\nGrad-Shafranov-based algorithm to identify SFRs during the first two PSP\nencounters. We find that the number of SFRs detected near the Sun is much less\nthan that at larger radial distances, where magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence may act as the local source to produce these structures. The\nprevalence of Alfvenic structures significantly suppresses the detection of\nSFRs at closer distances. We compare the SFR event list with other event\nidentification methods, yielding a dozen well-matched events. The cross-section\nmaps of two selected events confirm the cylindrical magnetic flux rope\nconfiguration. The power-law relation between the SFR magnetic field and\nheliocentric distances seems to hold down to 0.16 au.\n",

        "summary": "  Very low Earth orbits (VLEO), typically classified as orbits below\napproximately 450 km in altitude, have the potential to provide significant\nbenefits to spacecraft over those that operate in higher altitude orbits. This\npaper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of these benefits to\nspacecraft operations in VLEO, with parametric investigation of those which\napply specifically to Earth observation missions. The most significant benefit\nfor optical imaging systems is that a reduction in orbital altitude improves\nspatial resolution for a similar payload specification. Alternatively mass and\nvolume savings can be made whilst maintaining a given performance. Similarly,\nfor radar and lidar systems, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved.\nAdditional benefits include improved geospatial position accuracy, improvements\nin communications link-budgets, and greater launch vehicle insertion\ncapability. The collision risk with orbital debris and radiation environment\ncan be shown to be improved in lower altitude orbits, whilst compliance with\nIADC guidelines for spacecraft post-mission lifetime and deorbit is also\nassisted. Finally, VLEO offers opportunities to exploit novel\natmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems and aerodynamic attitude and\norbit control methods.\n  However, key challenges associated with our understanding of the lower\nthermosphere, aerodynamic drag, the requirement to provide a meaningful orbital\nlifetime whilst minimising spacecraft mass and complexity, and atomic oxygen\nerosion still require further research. Given the scope for significant\ncommercial, societal, and environmental impact which can be realised with\nhigher performing Earth observation platforms, renewed research efforts to\naddress the challenges associated with VLEO operations are required.\n",

        "summary": "  Solar activities have significant impact on the member of the solar systems\nincluding earth. As earth is a planet with its own magnetic field, solar\nemissions with magnetic fields do interact with the earth's own magnetic field\nto create geo-magnetic disturbances. Substorms are geo-magnetic disturbances of\nshorter duration (few hours or less) which are mainly concentrated in the\nauroral region and originates due to the ionospheric current injection at high\nlatitudes. Supersubstorm are intense substorms as identified by peak activities\nin geo-magnetic indices. In this thesis, we have investigated the energy\ndynamics during the supersubstorm and analyzed the relation of the energy\ncomponents with different geo-magnetic indices and interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) components. In particular, the solar wind energy levels and the\nenergy coupled into the magnetosphere as captured by the Akasofu parameter are\nstudied. A qualitative analysis of the computed energy and its relationship\nwith different geo-magnetic indices is presented. Correlation and\ncross-correlation analysis have been used to get insights into the nature of\nthe relationship between the energy components and indices. This for example\nuncovered the negative relationship between the solar wind energy and the\nAkasofu parameter. A summary analysis of the supersubstorm event in comparison\nwith the quiet phases are made. This has led to insights for example showing\nthe higher energy levels during supersubstorm and different energy ratios\n(Akasofu parameter divided by the solar wind energy) existing for different\nsupersubstorm.\n",

Extreme magnetic storms (minimum Dst $\\leq$ --250 nT) are\nextremely rare: only 7 events occurred during the era of spacecraft with\nhigh-level accelerometers such as CHAMP (CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload) and\nGRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate experiment), and none with minimum Dst\n$\\leq$ --500 nT, here termed magnetic superstorms. Therefore, current knowledge\nof thermospheric mass density response to superstorms is very limited. Thus, in\norder to advance this knowledge, four known magnetic superstorms in history,\ni.e., events occurring before CHAMP's and GRACE's commission times, with\ncomplete datasets, are used to empirically estimate density enhancements and\nsubsequent orbital drag. The November 2003 magnetic storm (minimum Dst = --422\nnT), the most extreme event observed by both satellites, is used as the\nbenchmark event. Results show that, as expected, orbital degradation is more\nsevere for the most intense storms. Additionally, results clearly point out\nthat the time duration of the storm is strongly associated with storm-time\norbital drag effects, being as important as or even more important than storm\nintensity itself. The most extreme storm-time decays during CHAMP/GRACE-like\nsample satellite orbits estimated for the March 1989 magnetic superstorm show\nthat long-lasting superstorms can have highly detrimental consequences for the\norbital dynamics of satellites in LEO.\n",

        "summary": "  Solar activity, ranging from the background solar wind to energetic coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs), is the main driver of the conditions in the\ninterplanetary space and in the terrestrial space environment, known as space\nweather. A better understanding of the Sun-Earth connection carries enormous\npotential to mitigate negative space weather effects with economic and social\nbenefits. Effective space weather forecasting relies on data and models. In\nthis paper, we discuss some of the most used space weather models, and propose\nsuitable locations for data gathering with space weather purposes. We report on\nthe application of \\textit{Representer analysis (RA)} and \\textit{Domain of\nInfluence (DOI) analysis} to three models simulating different stages of the\nSun-Earth connection: the OpenGGCM and Tsyganenko models, focusing on solar\nwind - magnetosphere interaction, and the PLUTO model, used to simulate CME\npropagation in interplanetary space. Our analysis is promising for space\nweather purposes for several reasons. First, we obtain quantitative information\nabout the most useful locations of observation points, such as solar wind\nmonitors. For example, we find that the absolute values of the DOI are\nextremely low in the magnetospheric plasma sheet. Since knowledge of that\nparticular sub-system is crucial for space weather, enhanced monitoring of the\nregion would be most beneficial. Second, we are able to better characterize the\nmodels. Although the current analysis focuses on spatial rather than temporal\ncorrelations, we find that time-independent models are less useful for Data\nAssimilation activities than time-dependent models. Third, we take the first\nsteps towards the ambitious goal of identifying the most relevant heliospheric\nparameters for modelling CME propagation in the heliosphere, their arrival\ntime, and their geoeffectiveness at Earth.\n",

        "summary": "  The main purpose of this work is to perform an analysis of realistic new\ntrajectories for a robotic mission to Saturn's largest moon, Titan, in order to\ndemonstrate the great advantages related to the Direct Fusion Drive (DFD). The\nDFD is a D -$^3$He fuelled, aneutronic, thermonuclear fusion propulsion system.\nThis fusion propulsion concept is based on a magnetically confined field\nreversed configuration plasma, where the deuterium propellant is heated by\nfusion products, and then expanded into a magnetic nozzle, providing both\nthrust and electrical energy to the spacecraft [1]. The trajectories\ncalculations and analysis for the Titan mission are obtained based on the\ncharacteristics provided by the PPPL [1]. Two different profile missions are\nconsidered: the first one is a thrust-coast-thrust profile with constant thrust\nand specific impulse; the second scenario is a continuous and constant thrust\nprofile mission. Each mission study is divided into four different phases,\nstarting from the initial low Earth orbit departure, the interplanetary\ntrajectory, Saturn orbit insertion and the Titan orbit insertion. For all\nmission phases, maneuver time and propellant consumption are calculated. The\nresults of calculations and mission analysis offer a complete overview of the\nadvantages in term of payload mass and travel time. It is important to\nemphasize that the deceleration capability is one of the DFD game changer: in\nfact, the DFD performance allows to rapidly reach high velocities and\ndecelerate in even shorter time period. This capability results in a total trip\nduration of 2.6 years for the thrust-coast-thrust profile and less than 2 years\nconsidering the continuous thrust profile. The high payload enabling\ncapability, combined with the huge electrical power available from the fusion\nreactor, leads to a tremendous advantage compared to present technology.\n",

We have developed a numerical time-depended code to calculate\nglobally distributed flux (GDF) of hydrogen ENAs employing both 1) 3D\nkinetic-MHD model of the global heliosphere and 2) reconstruction of atom\ntrajectories from 1 au, where they are observed by IBEX, to the point of their\norigin in the inner heliosheath (IHS). The key factor in the simulation is a\ndetailed kinetic consideration of the pickup ions (PUIs), the supra-thermal\ncomponent of protons in the heliosphere, which is \"parental\" to the ENAs and\noriginates in the region of the supersonic solar wind being picked by the\nheliospheric magnetic field. As a result of our study, we have concluded that\n(1) the developed model is able to reproduce the geometry of the multi-lobe\nstructure seen in the IBEX-Hi GDF maps, (2) the GDF is extremely sensitive to\nthe form of the velocity distribution function of PUIs in the IHS, and the\naccounting for the existence of an additional energetic population of PUIs is\nessential to explain the data, (3) despite a relatively good agreement, there\nare some quantitative differences between the model calculations and IBEX-Hi\ndata.

Using the high-resolution data in the inner\nheliosphere from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission, we find that the sub-ion\nscales (i.e., at the frequency f ~ [2, 9] Hz) follow a power-law spectrum f^a\nwith a spectral index a varying between -3 and -5.7. Our results also show that\nthere is a trend toward and anti-correlation between the spectral slopes and\nthe power amplitudes at the MHD scales, in agreement with previous studies: the\nhigher the power amplitude the steeper the spectrum at sub-ion scales. A\nsimilar trend toward an anti-correlation between steep spectra and increasing\nnormalized cross helicity is found, in agreement with previous theoretical\npredictions about the imbalanced solar wind.

An interplanetary shock wave was driven in front of the ICME. We\nfocus on the transmission of the magnetic fluctuations across the shock and\nanalyze the characteristic wave modes of solar wind turbulence near the shock\nobserved by both spacecraft. The ICME event is characterized by a magnetic\nhelicity based technique. The shock normal is determined by magnetic\ncoplanarity method for Solar Orbiter and using a mixed coplanarity approach for\nWind. The power spectra of magnetic field fluctuations are generated by\napplying both a fast Fourier transform and Morlet wavelet analysis. To\nunderstand the nature of waves observed near the shock, we use the normalized\nmagnetic helicity as a diagnostic parameter. The wavelet reconstructed magnetic\nfield fluctuation hodograms are used to further study the polarization\nproperties of waves. We find that the ICME-driven shock observed by Solar\nOrbiter and Wind is a fast forward oblique shock with a more perpendicular\nshock angle at 1 AU. After the shock crossing, the magnetic field fluctuation\npower increases. Most of the magnetic field fluctuation power resides in the\ntransverse fluctuations. In the vicinity of the shock, both spacecraft observe\nright-hand polarized waves in the spacecraft frame. The upstream wave\nsignatures fall in a relatively broad and low-frequency band, which might be\nattributed to low-frequency MHD waves excited by the streaming particles. For\nthe downstream magnetic wave activity, we find oblique kinetic Alfven waves\nwith frequencies near the proton cyclotron frequency in the spacecraft frame.\nThe frequency of the downstream waves increases by a factor of 7-10 due to the\nshock compression and the Doppler effect.\n",

The\n\"thermodynamic\" model, which represents the \"middle ground\", in terms of model\ncomplexity, appears to reproduce the observations most closely for all four\nencounters. Our results also contradict an earlier study that had hinted that\nthe open flux problem may disappear nearer the Sun. Instead, our results\nsuggest that this \"missing\" solar flux is still missing even at 26.9 Rs, and\nthus it cannot be explained by interplanetary processes. Finally, the model\nresults were also used to provide a global context for interpreting the\nlocalized in situ measurements.\n",

The mechanisms accelerating these particles, as\nwell as the locations where the acceleration occurs, remain debated. Here, we\nreport the findings of a simulation of a SIR event observed by Parker Solar\nProbe at ~0.56 au and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead at\n~0.95 au in 2019 September when both spacecraft were approximately radially\naligned with the Sun. The simulation reproduces the solar wind configuration\nand the energetic particle enhancements observed by both spacecraft. Our\nresults show that the energetic particles are produced at the compression waves\nassociated with the SIR and that the suprathermal tail of the solar wind is a\ngood candidate to provide the seed population for particle acceleration. The\nsimulation confirms that the acceleration process does not require shock waves\nand can already commence within Earth's orbit, with an energy dependence on the\nprecise location where particles are accelerated. The three-dimensional\nconfiguration of the solar wind streams strongly modulates the energetic\nparticle distributions, illustrating the necessity of advanced models to\nunderstand these particle events.\n",

We take advantage of this unique spacecraft constellation,\nalong with low solar activity across two solar rotations between May and July\n2020, to investigate how the solar wind structure, including the Heliospheric\nCurrent Sheet (HCS), varies with latitude. We visualise the sector structure of\nthe inner heliosphere by ballistically mapping the polarity and solar wind\nspeed from several spacecraft onto the Sun's source surface. We then assess the\nHCS morphology and orientation with the in situ data and compare with a\npredicted HCS shape. We resolve ripples in the HCS on scales of a few degrees\nin longitude and latitude, finding that the local orientation of sector\nboundaries were broadly consistent with the shape of the HCS but were steepened\nwith respect to a modelled HCS at the Sun. We investigate how several CIRs\nvaried with latitude, finding evidence for the compression region affecting\nslow solar wind outside the latitude extent of the faster stream. We also\nidentified several transient structures associated with HCS crossings, and\nspeculate that one such transient may have disrupted the local HCS orientation\nup to five days after its passage. We have shown that the solar wind structure\nvaries significantly with latitude, with this constellation providing context\nfor solar wind measurements that would not be possible with a single\nspacecraft. These measurements provide an accurate representation of the solar\nwind within $\\pm 10^{\\circ}$ latitude, which could be used as a more rigorous\nconstraint on solar wind models and space weather predictions.

We first evaluate the\npredictability of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) during VEX's\nmagnetospheric transits, and then map the induced field in a cylindrical\ncoordinate system under different IMF conditions. Our high-resolution mapping\nenables resolving structures on various scales, ranging from the thin ionopause\nand the associated electric currents to the classical global-scale draped IMF.\nOur mapping also resolves two recently-reported structures, a low ionospheric\nmagnetization over the terminator and a global \"looping\" structure in the near\nmagnetotail, both of which are not depicted in the classical draping\nconfiguration. In contrast to the reported IMF-independent cylindrical magnetic\nfield of both structures, our results illustrate their IMF dependence. In both\nstructures, the cylindrical magnetic component is stronger in the hemisphere\nwith an upward solar wind electric field ($E^{SW}$) than in the opposite\nhemisphere. Under downward $E^{SW}$, the \"looping\" structure even breaks, which\nis attributable to an additional draped magnetic field structure wrapping\ntoward $-E^{SW}$. In addition, our results suggest that these two structures\nare spatially not overlapping with each other. The low ionospheric structure\noccurs in a very narrow region, at about 87--95$^\\circ$ solar zenith angle and\n190--210~km altitude, implying that future simulation to reproduce the\nstructure entails at least a spatial resolution of about 10 km.

To achieve the best possible measurements, cross-calibration of the\nplasma instruments is needed. We construct with two different physical models\nto cross-calibrate the electron density as measured by the Mutual Impedance\nProbe (MIP) to the ion current and spacecraft potential as measured by the\nRosetta Langmuir Probe (LAP), the latter validated with the Ion Composition\nAnalyser (ICA). We retrieve a continuous plasma density dataset for the entire\ncometary mission with a much improved dynamical range compared to any plasma\ninstrument alone and, at times, improve the temporal resolution from\n0.24-0.74~Hz to 57.8~Hz. The new density dataset is consistent with the\nexisting MIP density dataset and covers long time periods where densities were\ntoo low to be measured by MIP. The physical model also yields, at 3~hour time\nresolution, ion flow speeds as well as a proxy for the solar EUV flux from the\nphotoemission from the Langmuir Probes. We report on two independent\nmission-wide estimates of the ion flow speed which are consistent with the bulk\nH$_2$O$^+$ ion velocities as measured by ICA. We find the ion flow to\nconsistently be much faster than the neutral gas over the entire mission,\nlending further evidence that the ions are collisionally decoupled from the\nneutrals in the coma. RPC measurements of ion speeds are therefore not\nconsistent with the assumptions made in previously published plasma density\nmodels of the comet ionosphere at the start and end of the mission. Also, the\nmeasured EUV flux is perfectly consistent with independently derived values\npreviously published from Johansson et al. (2017) and lends support for the\nconclusions drawn therein.\n",

        "summary": "  Solar wind electrons play an important role in the energy balance of the\nsolar wind acceleration by carrying energy into interplanetary space in the\nform of electron heat flux. The heat flux is stored in the complex electron\nvelocity distribution functions (VDFs) shaped by expansion, Coulomb collisions,\nand field-particle interactions. We investigate how the suprathermal electron\ndeficit in the anti-strahl direction, which was recently discovered in the\nnear-Sun solar wind, drives a kinetic instability and creates whistler waves\nwith wave vectors that are quasi-parallel to the direction of the background\nmagnetic field. We combine high-cadence measurements of electron pitch-angle\ndistribution functions and electromagnetic waves provided by Solar Orbiter\nduring its first orbit. Our case study is based on a burst-mode data interval\nfrom the Electrostatic Analyser System (SWA-EAS) at a distance of 112 $R_S$\n(0.52 au) from the Sun, during which several whistler wave packets were\ndetected by Solar Orbiter's Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument. The\nsunward deficit creates kinetic conditions under which the quasi-parallel\nwhistler wave is driven unstable. We directly test our predictions for the\nexistence of these waves through solar wind observations. We find whistler\nwaves that are quasi-parallel and almost circularly polarised, propagating away\nfrom the Sun, coinciding with a pronounced sunward deficit in the electron VDF.\nThe cyclotron-resonance condition is fulfilled for electrons moving in the\ndirection opposite to the direction of wave propagation, with energies\ncorresponding to those associated with the sunward deficit.\n",

Interesting enough, in\nsome cases the region where the severe reduction of these fluctuations takes\nplace is remarkably short in time, of the order of minutes, and located at the\nflow velocity knee separating the fast wind plateau from the rarefaction\nregion. The aim of this work is to investigate which are the physical\nmechanisms that might be at the origin of this phenomenon. We firstly looked\nfor the presence of any tangential discontinuity which might inhibit the\npropagation of Alfv\\'enic fluctuations from fast wind region to rarefaction\nregion. The absence of a clear evidence for the presence of this discontinuity\nbetween these two regions led us to proceed with ion composition analysis for\nthe corresponding solar wind, looking for any abrupt variation in minor ions\nparameters (as tracers of the source region) which might be linked to the\nphenomenon observed in the wind fluctuations. In the lack of a positive\nfeedback from this analysis, we finally propose a mechanism based on\ninterchange reconnection experienced by the field lines at the base of the\ncorona, within the region separating the open field lines of the coronal hole,\nsource of the fast wind, from the surrounding regions mainly characterized by\nclosed field lines.\n",

Here, we\nstudy the difference between proton and alpha bulk velocities near PSP\nperihelia of Encounters 3-7 when the core solar wind is in the field of view of\nthe Solar Probe Analyzer for Ions (SPAN-I) instrument. As previously reported\nat larger heliospheric distances, the alpha-proton differential speed observed\nby PSP is greater for fast wind than the slow solar wind. We compare PSP\nobservations with various spacecraft measurements and present the radial and\ntemporal evolution of the alpha-proton differential speed. The differential\nflow decreases as the solar wind propagates from the Sun, consistent with\nprevious observations. While Helios showed a small radial dependence of\ndifferential flow for the slow solar wind, PSP clearly showed this dependency\nfor the young slow solar wind down to 0.09 au. Our analysis shows that the\nalpha-proton differential speed's magnitude is mainly below the local Alfv\\'en\nspeed. Moreover, alpha particles usually move faster than protons close to the\nSun.

We\ncorrectly reproduce all the magnetic field components of the CME at Earth, with\nan arrival time error of approximately 1 hour. We further estimate the average\nsubjective uncertainties in the GCS fittings, by comparing the GCS parameters\nof 56 CMEs reported in multiple studies and catalogs. We determined that the\nGCS estimates of the CME latitude, longitude, tilt, and speed have average\nuncertainties of 5.74 degrees, 11.23 degrees, 24.71 degrees, and 11.4%\nrespectively. Using these, we have created 77 ensemble members for the\n12-July-2012 CME. We found that 55% of our ensemble members correctly reproduce\nthe sign of the magnetic field components at Earth. We also determined that the\nuncertainties in GCS fitting can widen the CME arrival time prediction window\nto about 12 hours for the 12-July-2012 CME. On investigating the forecast\naccuracy introduced by the uncertainties in individual GCS parameters, we\nconclude that the half-angle and aspect ratio have little impact on the\npredicted magnetic field of the 12-July-2012 CME, whereas the uncertainties in\nlongitude and tilt can introduce a relatively large spread in the magnetic\nfield predicted at Earth.\n",

        "summary": "  Io's movement relative to the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere creates\nAlfv\\'en waves propagating along the magnetic field lines which are partially\nreflected along their path. These waves are the root cause for auroral\nemission, which is subdivided into the Io Footprint (IFP), its tail and leading\nspot. New observations of the Juno spacecraft by Mura et al. (2018) have shown\npuzzling substructure of the footprint and its tail. In these observations, the\nsymmetry between the poleward and equatorward part of the footprint tail is\nbroken and the tail spots are alternatingly displaced. We show that the\nlocation of these bright spots in the tail are consistent with Alfv\\'en waves\nreflected at the boundary of the Io torus and Jupiter's ionosphere. Then, we\ninvestigate three different mechanisms to explain this phenomenon: (1) The Hall\neffect in Io's ionosphere, (2) travel time differences of Alfv\\'en waves\nbetween Io's Jupiter facing and its opposing side and (3) asymmetries in Io's\natmosphere. For that, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations within an\nidealized geometry of the system. We use the Poynting flux near the Jovian\nionosphere as a proxy for the morphology of the generated footprint and its\ntail. We find that the Hall effect is the most important mechanism under\nconsideration to break the symmetry causing the \"Alternating Alfv\\'en spot\nstreet\". The travel time differences contributes to enhance this effect. We\nfind no evidence that the inhomogeneities in Io's atmosphere contribute\nsignificantly to the location or shape of the tail spots.\n",

A\nbenefit to ML over parametric models is that there are no predefined basis\nfunctions limiting the phenomena that can be modeled. In this work, we develop\nML models on three datasets: the Space Environment Technologies (SET) High\nAccuracy Satellite Drag Model (HASDM) density database, a spatiotemporally\nmatched dataset of outputs from the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 Empirical Thermospheric\nDensity Model (JB2008), and an accelerometer-derived density dataset from\nCHAllenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP).

We find that both NRLMSIS 2.0 and JB2008-ML do not account\nfor post-storm cooling and consequently perform poorly in periods following\nstrong geomagnetic storms (e.g. the 2003 Halloween storms). Conversely,\nHASDM-ML and CHAMP-ML do show evidence of post-storm cooling indicating that\nthis phenomenon is present in the original datasets.

This work describes an inner boundary condition for ambient\nsolar wind models based on tomography maps of the coronal plasma density gained\nfrom coronagraph observations, providing a novel alternative to magnetic\nextrapolations. The tomographical density maps provide a direct constraint of\nthe coronal structure at heliocentric distances of 4 to 8Rs, thus avoiding the\nneed to model the complex non-radial lower corona. An empirical inverse\nrelationship converts densities to solar wind velocities which are used as an\ninner boundary condition by the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation (HUXt) model\nto give ambient solar wind velocity at Earth. The dynamic time warping (DTW)\nalgorithm is used to quantify the agreement between tomography/HUXt output and\nin situ data. An exhaustive search method is then used to adjust the lower\nboundary velocity range in order to optimize the model. Early results show up\nto a 32% decrease in mean absolute error between the modelled and observed\nsolar wind velocities compared to that of the coupled MAS/HUXt model. The use\nof density maps gained from tomography as an inner boundary constraint is thus\na valid alternative to coronal magnetic models, and offers a significant\nadvancement in the field given the availability of routine space-based\ncoronagraph observations.\n",

Using a rare set of near-simultaneous data from these\ntwo orbiters, we find that there is either an increasing (e.g., for $CO_2$ and\n$Ar$) or a decreasing (e.g., for $O$) trend of the density profiles by a factor\nof 2 between June 1 to June 15, 2018, in the height region of $\\sim$150-300 km.\nA time series analysis of the concurrent in-situ solar EUV spectral flux and\nthe $H^+$ ion velocities of the incident solar wind measured near MAVEN\nperiapsis showed the former going through a decrease of only $\\sim$10\\%\ncompared to the latter's decrease by a factor of 4 within the same\nnon-solar-flare period of observation. The estimates of standard errors and the\nuse of linear regression analysis for the correlation coefficients between\ndensities and solar radiation components have been carried out. Invoking simple\nphotochemical equilibrium conditions with the dissociation of $CO_2$ (producing\n$CO$ and $O$) through solar EUV radiation and the solar wind $H^+$ ion impact\nprocess, the day-to-day variations of these constituents are estimated. The\nhigh and significant anti-correlation between the density variations of $CO_2$\nand $O$ due to the dissociation of $CO_2$ by the solar wind particle radiation\nis clearly demonstrated. The cause for the increasing densities of $Ar$ like\nthat of $CO_2$ during this period is more complex and would likely be governed\nby the temperature variations due to absorption of solar EUV/charged particle\nradiation and other interacting dynamical effects.\n",

The temporal evolution of shock parameters and particle\nfluxes during this event are examined. We find that adopting a realistic solar\nwind background can significantly impact the expansion of the shock and\nconsequently the shock parameters. Time intensity profiles with an energetic\nstorm particle event at PSP are well reproduced from the simulation. In\naddition, the simulated and observed time intensity profiles of protons show a\nsimilar two-phase enhancement at STA. These results illustrate that modelling a\nshock using a realistic solar wind is crucial in determining the\ncharacteristics of SEP events. The decay phase of the modelled time intensity\nprofiles at Earth agrees well with observations, indicating the importance of\nperpendicular diffusion in widespread SEP events.

The rotation of\ntheir magnetic field is typically interpreted as the crossing of a twisted\nmagnetic flux tube, or flux rope, which was launched from the solar corona. The\ndetailed magnetic measurements across MCs permit us to infer the flux rope\ncharacteristics. Still, the precise spatial distribution of the magnetic twist\nis challenging, and thus is debated. In order to improve the robustness of the\nresults, we performed a superposed epoch analysis (SEA) of a set of well\nobserved MCs at 1 au. While previous work was done using the MC central time,\nwe here used the result of a fitted flux rope model to select the time of the\nclosest approach to the flux rope axis. This implies a precise separation of\nthe in- and outbound regions to coherently phase the observed signals. We also\nsearched for and minimised the possible biases such as magnetic asymmetry and a\nfinite impact parameter. We applied the SEA to derive the median profiles both\nfor the flux rope remaining when crossed by the spacecraft and to recover the\none present before erosion. In particular, the median azimuthal B component is\nnearly a linear function of the radius. More generally, the results confirm our\nprevious results realised without such a deep analysis. The twist profile is\nnearly uniform in the flux rope core, with a steep increase at the border of\nthe flux rope and with similar profiles in the in- and outbound regions.

        "summary": "  Operating satellites in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) benefits the already\nexpanding New Space industry in applications including Earth Observation and\nbeyond. However, long-term operations at such low altitudes require propulsion\nsystems to compensate for the large aerodynamic drag forces. When using\nconventional propulsion systems, the amount of storable propellant limits the\nmaximum mission lifetime. The latter can be avoided by employing\nAtmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP) system, which collects the\nresidual atmospheric particles and uses them as propellant for an electric\nthruster. Thus, the requirement of on-board propellant storage can ideally be\nnullified. At the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) of the University of\nStuttgart, an intake, and a RF Helicon-based Plasma Thruster (IPT) for ABEP\nsystem are developed within the Horizons 2020 funded DISCOVERER project. In\norder to assess possible future use cases, this paper proposes and analyzes\nseveral novel ABEP based mission scenarios. Beginning with technology\ndemonstration mission in VLEO, more complex mission scenarios are derived and\ndiscussed in detail. These include, amongst others, orbit maintenance around\nMars as well as refuelling and space tug missions. The results show that the\nABEP system is not only able to compensate drag for orbit maintenance but also\ncapable of performing orbital maneuvers and collect propellant for applications\nsuch as Space Tug and Refuelling. Thus, showing a multitude of different future\nmission applications.\n",

        "summary": "  Switchbacks are rapid magnetic field reversals that last from seconds to\nhours. Current Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations pose many open questions\nin regard to the nature of switchbacks. For example, are they stable as they\npropagate through the inner heliosphere, and how are they formed? In this work,\nwe aim to investigate the structure and origin of switchbacks. In order to\nstudy the stability of switchbacks, we suppose the small-scale current sheets\ntherein are generated by magnetic braiding, and they should work to stabilize\nthe switchbacks. With more than one thousand switchbacks identified with PSP\nobservations in seven encounters, we find many more current sheets inside than\noutside switchbacks, indicating that these microstructures should work to\nstabilize the S-shaped structures of switchbacks. Additionally, we study the\nhelium variations to trace the switchbacks to their origins. We find both\nhelium-rich and helium-poor populations in switchbacks, implying that the\nswitchbacks could originate from both closed and open magnetic field regions in\nthe Sun. Moreover, we observe that the alpha-proton differential speeds also\nshow complex variations as compared to the local Alfv\\'en speed. The joint\ndistributions of both parameters show that low helium abundance together with\nlow differential speed is the dominant state in switchbacks. The presence of\nsmall-scale current sheets in switchbacks along with the helium features are in\nline with the hypothesis that switchbacks could originate from the Sun via\ninterchange reconnection process. However, other formation mechanisms are not\nexcluded.\n",

We present a method to describe the solar wind\nparameters by quantifying the effects of plasma on our radio signal. In doing\nso, we identify all the uncompensated effects on the radio signal and see which\ncoronal processes drive them. From a technical standpoint, quantifying the\neffect of the plasma on the radio signal helps phase referencing for precision\nspacecraft tracking. The phase fluctuation of the signal was determined for\nMars' orbit for solar elongation angles from 0 - 180 deg. The calculated phase\nresiduals allow determination of the phase power spectrum. The total electron\ncontent (TEC) of the solar plasma along the line of sight is calculated by\nremoving effects from mechanical and ionospheric noises. The spectral index was\ndetermined as $-2.43 \\pm 0.11$ which is in agreement with Kolomogorov's\nturbulence. The theoretical models are consistent with observations at lower\nsolar elongations however at higher solar elongation ($>$160 deg) we see the\nobserved values to be higher. This can be caused when the uplink and downlink\nsignals are positively correlated as a result of passing through identical\nplasma sheets.\n",

Compressible magnetohydrodynamic simulations provide useful\ninsights into the nature of density fluctuations. We discuss a few important\neffects related to 3D simulations of turbulence and in-situ observations. The\nobserved quantities such as the power spectrum and variance depend on the angle\nbetween the sampling trajectory and the mean magnetic field due to anisotropy\nof the turbulence. The anisotropy effect is stronger at smaller scales and\nlower plasma beta. Additionally, in-situ measurements tend to exhibit a broad\nrange of variations, even though they could be drawn from the same population\nwith the defined averages, so a careful averaging may be needed to reveal the\nscaling relations between density variations and other turbulence quantities\nsuch as turbulent Mach number from observations.\n",

Currently, only a\nhandful of techniques have been proposed and they remain limited in scope and\naccuracy. Recently, a robust machine learning (ML) technique was developed for\npredicting the minimum value of Bz within ICMEs based on a set of 42\n'features', that is, variables calculated from measured quantities upstream of\nthe ICME and within its sheath region. In this study, we investigate these\nso-called explanatory variables in more detail, focusing on those that were (1)\nstatistically significant; and (2) most important. We find that number density\nand magnetic field strength accounted for a large proportion of the\nvariability. These features capture the degree to which the ICME compresses the\nambient solar wind ahead. Intuitively, this makes sense: Energy made available\nto CMEs as they erupt is partitioned into magnetic and kinetic energy. Thus,\nmore powerful CMEs are launched with larger flux-rope fields (larger Bz), at\ngreater speeds, resulting in more sheath compression (increased number density\nand total field strength).\n",

        "summary": "  Particles measured in large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events are\nbelieved to be predominantly accelerated at shocks driven by coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). Ion charge state and composition analyses suggest that the\norigin of the seed particle population for the mechanisms of particle\nacceleration at CME-driven shocks is not the bulk solar wind thermal material,\nbut rather a suprathermal population present in the solar wind. This\nsuprathermal population could result from remnant material accelerated in prior\nsolar flares and/or preceding CME-driven shocks. In this work, we examine the\ndistribution of this suprathermal particle population in the inner heliosphere\nby combining a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the solar wind and a\nMonte-Carlo simulation of particle acceleration and transport. Assuming that\nthe seed particles are uniformly distributed near the Sun by solar flares of\nvarious magnitudes, we study the longitudinal distribution of the seed\npopulation at multiple heliocentric distances. We consider a non-uniform\nbackground solar wind, consisting of fast and slow streams that lead to\ncompression and rarefaction regions within the solar wind. Our simulations show\nthat the seed population at a particular location (e.g., 1 au) is strongly\nmodulated by the underlying solar wind configuration. Corotating interaction\nregions (CIRs) and merged interactions regions (MIRs) can strongly alter the\nenergy spectra of the seed particle populations. In addition, cross-field\ndiffusion plays an important role in mitigating strong variations of the seed\npopulation in both space and energy.\n",

These three\nconditions result in a direct coupling between the plasma emitted from the Sun\n(namely the solar wind) and Mercury's surface. The planet's magnetic field\nleads to a non-trivial pattern of plasma precipitation onto the surface, that\nis expected to contribute to the alteration of the regolith over geological\ntime scales. The goal of this work is to study the solar wind plasma\nprecipitation onto the surface of Mercury from a geographical perspective, as\nopposed to the local-time-of-day approach of previous precipitation modeling\nstudies. We employ solar wind precipitation maps for protons and electrons from\ntwo fully-kinetic numerical simulations of Mercury's plasma environment. These\nmaps are then integrated over two full Mercury orbits (176 Earth days). We\nfound that the plasma precipitation pattern at the surface is most strongly\naffected by the upstream solar wind conditions, particularly by the\ninterplanetary magnetic field direction, and less by Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit\nresonance. We also found that Mercury's magnetic field is able to shield the\nsurface from roughly 90% of the incoming solar wind flux. At the surface,\nprotons have a broad energy distribution from below 500 eV to more than 1.5\nkeV; while electrons are mostly found in the range 0.1-4 keV. These results\nwill help to better constrain space weathering and exosphere source processes\nat Mercury, as well as to interpret observations by the ongoing ESA/JAXA\nBepiColombo mission.\n",

A peculiarity of this event is that the presence of a high speed stream\n(HSS) affected the low-energy ion component ($\\lesssim 5$ MeV) of the gradual\nSEP event at both Bepi and ACE, despite the HSS having only a modest solar wind\nspeed increase. Using the EUHFORIA (European Heliospheric FORecasting\nInformation Asset) magnetohydrodynamic model, we replicate the solar wind\nduring the event and the coronal mass ejection (CME) that generated it. We then\ncombine these results with the energetic particle transport model PARADISE\n(PArticle Radiation Asset Directed at Interplanetary Space Exploration). We\nfind that the structure of the CME-driven shock was affected by the non-uniform\nsolar wind, especially near the HSS, resulting in a shock wavefront with strong\nvariations in its properties such as its compression ratio and obliquity. By\nscaling the emission of energetic particles from the shock to the solar wind\ncompression at the shock, an excellent match between the PARADISE simulation\nand in-situ measurements of $\\lesssim 5$ MeV ions is obtained. Our modelling\nshows that the intricate intensity variations observed at both ACE and Bepi\nwere influenced by the non-uniform emission of energetic particles from the\ndeformed shock wave and demonstrates the influence of even modest background\nsolar wind structures on the development of SEP events.\n",

One of the most commonly used space weather proxies, $F_{10.7\ncm}$, correlates well with solar extreme ultra-violet (EUV) energy deposition\ninto the thermosphere. Currently, the USAF contracts Space Environment\nTechnologies (SET), which uses a linear algorithm to forecast $F_{10.7 cm}$. In\nthis work, we introduce methods using neural network ensembles with multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) and long-short term memory (LSTMs) to improve on the SET\npredictions. We make predictions only from historical $F_{10.7 cm}$ values, but\nalso investigate data manipulation to improve forecasting. We investigate data\nmanipulation methods (backwards averaging and lookback) as well as multi step\nand dynamic forecasting. This work shows an improvement over the baseline when\nusing ensemble methods. The best models found in this work are ensemble\napproaches using multi step or a combination of multi step and dynamic\npredictions. Nearly all approaches offer an improvement, with the best models\nimproving between 45 and 55\\% on relative MSE. Other relative error metrics\nwere shown to improve greatly when ensembles methods were used. We were also\nable to leverage the ensemble approach to provide a distribution of predicted\nvalues; allowing an investigation into forecast uncertainty. Our work found\nmodels that produced less biased predictions at elevated and high solar\nactivity levels. Uncertainty was also investigated through the use of a\ncalibration error score metric (CES), our best ensemble reached similar CES as\nother work.\n",

The ISWAT\ncluster \"H3: Radiation Environment in the Heliosphere\"\n(https://www.iswat-cospar.org/h3) has been working to provide a scientific\nplatform to understand, characterize and predict the energetic particle\nradiation in the heliosphere with the practical goal of mitigating radiation\nrisks associated with areospace activities, satellite industry and human space\nexplorations. In particular, present approaches help us understand the physical\nphenomena at large, optimizing the output of multi-viewpoint observations and\npushing current models to their limits.\n  In this paper, we review the scientific aspects of the radiation environment\nin the heliosphere covering four different radiation types: Solar Energetic\nParticles (SEPs), Ground Level Enhancement (GLE, a type of SEP events with\nenergies high enough to trigger the enhancement of ground-level detectors),\nGalactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and Anomalous Cosmic Rays (ACRs). We focus on\nrelated advances in the research community in the past 10-20 years and what we\nstill lack in terms of understanding and predictive capabilities.

They are generally believed to\npossess a magnetic field configuration of a magnetic flux rope and formed\nthrough magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause, sometimes\naccompanied with enhanced plasma convection in the ionosphere. We examine two\nFTE events under the condition of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nwith a dawn-dusk component at the magnetopause by applying the Grad-Shafranov\n(GS) reconstruction method to the in-situ measurements by the Magnetospheric\nMultiscale (MMS) spacecraft to derive the magnetic flux contents associated\nwith the FTE flux ropes. In particular, given a cylindrical magnetic flux rope\nconfiguration derived from the GS reconstruction, the magnetic flux content can\nbe characterized by both the toroidal (axial) and poloidal fluxes. We then\nestimate the amount of magnetic flux (i.e., the reconnection flux) encompassed\nby the area ``opened\" in the ionosphere, based on the ground-based Super Dual\nAuroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observations. We find that for event 1, the\nFTE flux rope is oriented in the approximate dawn-dusk direction, and the\namount of its poloidal magnetic flux agrees with the corresponding reconnection\nflux. For event 2, the agreement among the estimates of the magnetic fluxes is\nuncertain. We provide a detailed description about our interpretation for the\ntopological features of the FTE flux ropes, based on a formation scenario of\nsequential magnetic field reconnection between adjacent field lines, consistent\nwith our results.\n",

In some ICMEs, the magnetic ejecta exhibits a magnetic flux rope (FR)\nstructure; the strong magnetic field strength and closed field line geometry of\nsuch ICME FRs has been proposed to act as a shield to GCR transport. In this\nstudy, we identify four ICMEs near Earth that drove Fds with similar mean\nmagnetic field strengths (20 - 25 nT); two ICMEs with more typical mean speeds\n(~400 km/s), and two fast (~750 km/s) ICMEs.

We investigate the different mechanisms that contribute to the\nresulting ICME-related Fds and their recovery, and determine which properties,\nif any, play a more important role than others in driving Fds.

We then\nuse data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter to compare induced magnetic fields at\nVenus with those at Mars. At Venus, the vertical structure of the magnetic\nfield tends to exist in one of two states (magnetized or unmagnetized) but we\nfind the induced fields at Mars are more complicated, and we are unable to use\nthis simple classification scheme. We also find the low-altitude induced field\nstrength in the ionospheres of both Venus and Mars vary with as cosine of the\nangle between solar wind velocity and the magnetic pileup boundary. The\nlow-altitude field strength at Venus tends to be higher than Mars. However,\nVenus field strengths are lower than theoretical predictions assuming pressure\nbalance and negligible thermal pressure. For Mars, low-altitude field strengths\nare higher than expected given these assumptions. Induced field strengths\nexhibit a trend with solar wind dynamic pressure that is consistent with\npressure balance expectations at both planets, however there is significant\nuncertainty in the Venus fit due to lack of upstream solar wind data.

Taking inspiration from BERT-like self-supervised\nlanguage models in the field of natural language processing, we introduce\nORBERT, and demonstrate the ability of such a model to leverage large\nquantities of readily available orbit data to learn meaningful representations\nthat can be used to aid in downstream tasks. As a proof of concept of this\napproach we consider the task of all vs. all conjunction screening, phrased\nhere as a machine learning time series classification task. We show that\nleveraging unlabelled orbit data leads to improved performance, and that the\nproposed approach can be particularly beneficial for tasks where the\navailability of labelled data is limited.\n",

Here, for the\nfirst time, we develop an analytic model of an axisymmetric switchback with\nuniform magnetic field strength. In this model, three parameters control the\ngeometry of the switchback: height (length along the background magnetic\nfield), width (thickness along radial direction perpendicular to the background\nfield), and the radial distance from the center of switchback to the central\naxis, which is a proxy of the size of the switchback along the third dimension.\nWe carry out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate\nthe dynamic evolution of the switchback. Comparing simulations conducted with\ncompressible and incompressible codes, we verify that compressibility, i.e.\nparametric decay instability, is necessary for destabilizing the switchback.\nOur simulations also reveal that the geometry of the switchback significantly\naffects how fast the switchback destabilizes. The most stable switchbacks are\n2D-like (planar) structures with large aspect ratios (length to width),\nconsistent with the observations. We show that when plasma beta ($\\beta$) is\nsmaller than one, the switchback is more stable as $\\beta$ increases. However,\nwhen $\\beta$ is greater than one, the switchback becomes very unstable as the\npattern of the growing compressive fluctuations changes. Our results may\nexplain some of the observational features of switchbacks, including the large\naspect ratios and nearly constant occurrence rates in the inner heliosphere.\n",

Onboard PSP is the\nIS\\(\\odot\\)IS instrument suite measuring ions over energies from ~ 20\nkeV/nucleon to 200 MeV/nucleon and electrons from ~ 20 keV to 6 MeV. Previous\nstudies sought to group CME characteristics based on their plasma conditions\nand arrived at general descriptions with large statistical errors, leaving open\nquestions on how to properly group CMEs based solely on their plasma\nconditions. To help resolve these open questions, plasma properties of CMEs\nhave been examined in relation to SEPs. Here we reexamine one plasma property,\nthe solar wind proton temperature, and compare it to the proton SEP intensity\nin a region immediately downstream of a CME-driven shock for seven CMEs\nobserved at radial distances within 1 au. We find a statistically strong\ncorrelation between proton SEP intensity and bulk proton temperature,\nindicating a clear relationship between SEPs and the conditions in the solar\nwind. Furthermore, we propose that an indirect coupling of SEP intensity to the\nlevel of turbulence and the amount of energy dissipation that results is mainly\nresponsible for the observed correlation between SEP intensity and proton\ntemperature. These results are key to understanding the interaction of SEPs\nwith the bulk solar wind in CME-driven shocks and will improve our ability to\nmodel the interplay of shock evolution and particle acceleration.\n",

First, by\nanalyzing the radial distribution of ICME classification based on magnetic\nhodograms, we find that coherent configurations are more likely to be observed\nclose to the Sun. In contrast, more complex configurations are observed farther\nout. We also notice that the post-ICME magnetic field is more impacted\nfollowing an ICME passage at larger heliocentric distances. Second, with a\nmulti-linear robust regression, we derive a slower magnetic ejecta (ME)\nexpansion rate within 1~au compared to previous statistical estimates. Then,\ninvestigating the magnetic field fluctuations within ICME sheaths, we see that\nthese fluctuations are strongly coupled to the relative magnetic field strength\ngradient from the upstream solar wind to the ME. Third, we identify ME\nexpansion as an important factor in forming sheaths. Finally, we determine the\ndistortion parameter (DiP) which is a measure of magnetic field asymmetry in an\nME. We discover lower overall asymmetries within MEs. We reveal that even for\nexpanding MEs, the time duration over which an ME is sampled does not correlate\nwith DiP values, indicating that the aging effect is not the sole contributor\nto the observed ME asymmetries.\n",

        "summary": "  EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) is a\nphysics-based data-driven solar wind and CME propagation model designed for\nspace weather forecasting and event analysis investigations. Although EUHFORIA\ncan predict the solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties at Earth, it is\nnot equipped to quantify the geoeffectiveness of the solar transients in terms\nof the geomagnetic indices like the disturbance storm time (Dst) index and the\neauroral indices that quantify the impact of the magnetized plasma encounters\non Earth's magnetosphere. Therefore, we couple EUHFORIA with the Open Geospace\nGeneral Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), a magnetohydrodynamic model of the\nresponse of Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere, to transient\nsolar wind characteristics. In this coupling, OpenGGCM is driven by the solar\nwind and interplanetary magnetic field obtained from EUHFORIA simulations to\nproduce the magnetospheric and ionospheric response to the CMEs. This coupling\nis validated with two observed geoeffective CME events driven with the\nspheromak flux-rope CME model. We compare these simulation results with the\nindices obtained from OpenGGCM simulations driven by the measured solar wind\ndata from spacecraft. We further employ the dynamic time warping (DTW)\ntechnique to assess the model performance in predicting Dst. The main highlight\nof this study is to use EUHFORIA simulated time series to predict the Dst and\nauroral indices 1 to 2 days in advance, as compared to using the observed solar\nwind data at L1, which only provides predictions 1 to 2 hours before the actual\nimpact.\n",

We do so through three proxies - variation in total\nelectron content between 80 and 300 km altitude, peak density, and peak\naltitude - of the aforementioned 62 ROSE electron density profiles, relative to\na characterisation of the ionosphere through solar minimum leading to solar\nmaximum, specific to local time sector and season, presented in Segale et al.,\n(COMPANION). We observe an increased Total Electron Content (TEC) between 80\nand 300 km altitude up to 2.5 x 10(15) m(-2) in April 2021 and up to 5 x 10(15)\nm(-2) in June-July 2022 compared to the baseline photochemically produced\nionosphere. This increase in TEC corresponds mainly to increases in the solar\nenergetic particles flux (detected by MAVEN SEP) and electron fluxes (detected\nby MAVEN SWEA). In addition to solar events, in June-July 2022, an A storm and\na B storm were occurring and merging on the surface of Mars. We observe a raise\nin peak altitude in general lower than expected during dust storms, possibly\ndue to high values of solar wind dynamic pressure (derived from MAVEN SWIA).\nFrom 31 ROSE profiles collected in this time period that showed both the M2 and\nM1 layer, we observe that, on average, M1 and M2 peak altitudes raise the same\namount, suggesting that the thermosphere might loft as a unit during dust\nstorms. During this time period, several proton aurora events of variable\nbrightness were detected with MAVEN IUVS underlining the complex and\nmultifaceted impact of dust activity and extreme solar activity on the Martian\nionosphere.\n",

We present an analysis of the\nglobal flux rope structure of the 2022 September 5 CME event that impacted PSP\nat a heliocentric distance of only 0.07 au and SolO at 0.69 au. We compare in\nsitu measurements at PSP and SolO to determine global and local expansion\nmeasures, finding a good agreement between magnetic field relationships with\nheliocentric distance, but significant differences with respect to flux rope\nsize. We use PSP/WISPR images as input to the ELEvoHI model, providing a direct\nlink between remote and in situ observations; we find a large discrepancy\nbetween the resulting modeled arrival times, suggesting that the underlying\nmodel assumptions may not be suitable when using data obtained close to the\nSun, where the drag regime is markedly different in comparison to larger\nheliocentric distances. Finally, we fit the SolO/MAG and PSP/FIELDS data\nindependently with the 3DCORE model and find that many parameters are\nconsistent between spacecraft, however, challenges are apparent when\nreconstructing a global 3D structure that aligns with arrival times at PSP and\nSolar Orbiter, likely due to the large radial and longitudinal separations\nbetween spacecraft.

We\ninvestigate the propagation and interaction properties of the two CMEs\ncorrelated with the MC using coordinated multi-point remote sensing and in situ\nobservations from Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, SOHO, and Wind. The first CME was\ntriggered by a filament eruption with a high inclination angle. Roughly 9 hr\nlater, the second CME originating from the same active region erupted with a\nsmaller tilt angle and faster speed compared to the first one. The second CME\novertook the preceding CME and formed a merged front at approximately 75\n\\rsun{}, which developed into a complex ejecta at 1 AU. The descending speed\nand low proton temperature inside the complex ejecta suggest that the two CMEs\nhave fully merged before reaching 1 AU, leading them to begin expanding rather\nthan compressing against each other. The complex ejecta appears to have the\nmagnetic field and plasma signatures of an MC, although there is a\ndiscontinuity in the magnetic field implying previous interactions. The cross\nsection of the complex ejecta, reconstructed from in situ data using a\nGrad-Shafranov technique, exhibits a right--handed flux rope structure.

In these missions, the residual acceleration noise of the test mass(TM)\ncaused by the forces from inertial sensor components and environment is\nsupposed to be kept below a certain level. As a number of forces contributing\nto residual acceleration are related to actuation system, developing a precise\nactuation system to exclude any erroneous force and obtain an ultra sensitive\nvalue for TM acceleration noise is necessary and essential. However, it is\ndifficult to test the actuation system on ground.

The experimental results show that the parameters in an actuation\nsystem will introduce additional torque noise and the maximum noise can reach\nas much as 10^{-13}Nm /Hz^{1/2} at 1 mHz. The stable tracking error for the\nclosed-loop system is about 10^{-7}, indicating that the combination system\nachieves good tracking performance and robustness for TM rotation control in\ndifferent conditions of inertial sensors.\n",

Limited\nempirical evidence exists for SDDA within the solar wind turbulence's inertial\nrange. We analyzed data from the WIND mission to assess the effects of\ncompressibility, intermittency, and imbalance on SDDA. SDDA consistently\nappears at energy-containing scales, with a trend toward misalignment at\ninertial scales. Compressible fluctuations show no increased alignment;\nhowever, their impact on SDDA's overall behavior is minimal. The alignment\nangles inversely correlate with field gradient intensity, likely due to\n\"anomalous\" or \"counterpropagating\" wave packet interactions. This suggests\nthat SDDA originates from mutual shearing of Els\\\"asser fields during\nimbalanced ($\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm} \\gg \\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{\\mp}$)\ninteractions. Rigorous thresholding on field gradient intensity reveals SDDA\nsignatures across much of the inertial range. The scaling of Els\\\"asser\nincrements' alignment angle, $\\Theta^{z}$, steepens with increasing global\nAlfv\\'enic imbalance, while the angle between magnetic and velocity field\nincrements, $\\Theta^{ub}$, becomes shallower. $\\Theta^{ub}$ only correlates\nwith global Els\\\"asser imbalance, steepening as the imbalance increases.\nFurthermore, increasing alignment in $\\Theta^{ub}$ persists deep into the\ninertial range of balanced intervals but collapses at large scales for\nimbalanced ones. Simplified theoretical analysis and modeling of\nhigh-frequency, low-amplitude noise in the velocity field indicate significant\nimpacts on alignment angle measurements even at very low frequencies, with\neffects growing as global imbalance increases.\n",

In\nthis study, we demonstrate the application of the modified Miller-Turner (mMT)\nmodel implemented in EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset\n(EUHFORIA), to forecast the geo-effectiveness of observed coronal mass ejection\n(CME) events in the heliosphere. The goal is to develop a model that not only\nhas a global geometry to improve overall forecasting but is also fast enough\nfor operational space weather forecasting. We test the original full torus\nimplementation and introduce a new three-fourth Torus version called the\nHorseshoe CME model. This new model has a more realistic CME geometry, and it\novercomes the inaccuracies of the full torus geometry. We constrain the torus\ngeometrical and magnetic field parameters using observed signatures of the CMEs\nbefore, during, and after the eruption. The assessment of the model's\ncapability to predict the most important Bz component is performed using the\nadvanced Dynamic Time Warping technique. The Horseshoe model prediction of CME\narrival time and geo-effectiveness for both validation events compare well to\nthe observations and are weighed with the results obtained with the spheromak\nand FRi3D models that were already available in EUHFORIA. The runtime of the\nHorseshoe model simulations is close to that of the spheromak model, which is\nsuitable for operational space weather forecasting. Yet, the capability of the\nmagnetic field prediction at 1~AU of the Horseshoe model is close to that of\nthe FRi3D model.

We use a relatively simple\nthree-dimensional simulation of a CME initiated with a highly-twisted flux\nrope.

An analysis of MAVEN data, combined with\nobservation-based simulations, reveals that the bulk of O+ ions would be in\nresonance with ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves when the latter were present.\nThis interaction then results in significant particle energization, thus\nenhancing ion escaping.

A primary\nhealth risk associated with these missions is radiation exposure, primarily\nfrom galatic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs). While GCRs\npresent a more consistent, albeit modulated threat, SPEs are harder to predict\nand can deliver acute doses over short periods. Currently NASA utilizes\nanalytical tools for monitoring the space radiation environment in order to\nmake decisions of immediate action to shelter astronauts. However this reactive\napproach could be significantly enhanced by predictive models that can forecast\nradiation exposure in advance, ideally hours ahead of major events, while\nproviding estimates of prediction uncertainty to improve decision-making. In\nthis work we present a machine learning approach for forecasting radiation\nexposure in BLEO using multimodal time-series data including direct solar\nimagery from Solar Dynamics Observatory, X-ray flux measurements from GOES\nmissions, and radiation dose measurements from the BioSentinel satellite that\nwas launched as part of Artemis~1 mission.

Preliminary results show that the performance of this lower SWaP OEO\nsystem is comparable or in some respects better than the electrical system\nalready used in the MWS, MWS and MWI missions of ESA. Specifically, a sidemode\nsuppression of about 46 dB, a phase noise of -102 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, and\nfrequency stability of 30 kHz in a ten-minute interval is achieved for the\n45.86 GHz signal. The OEO is a promising candidate to replace or supplement the\nelectronic systems of phase locked dielectric resonator oscillator and\nfrequency multipliers used currently in Earth observation.\n",

By conservatively using as initial position the lower\nbounds on the present-day distance dX of X dynamically inferred from the\ngravitational perturbations induced by it on the orbital motions of the planets\nof the solar system, both the analyses show that, in order to reach the Earth's\norbit in the next 2 yr, X should move at a highly unrealistic speed v, whatever\nits mass MX is. For example, by assuming for it a solar (MX =M_Sun) or brown\ndwarf mass (MX = 80mJup), now at not less than dX = 11-6 kau (1 kau=1000\nastronomical units), v would be of the order of 6-10% and 3-5% of the speed of\nlight c, respectively. By assuming larger present-day distances for X, on the\nbasis of the lacking of direct observational evidences of electromagnetic\norigin for it, its speed would be even higher. Instead, the fastest solitary\nmassive objects known so far, like hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and supernova\nremnants (SRs), travel at v = 0.002-0.005c, having acquired so huge velocities\nin some of the most violent astrophysical phenomena like interactions with\nsupermassive galactic black holes and supernova explosions. It turns out that\nthe orbit of the Earth would not be macroscopically altered by a close (0.2 au)\npassage of such an ultrafast body X in the next 2 yr. On the contrary, our\nplanet would be hurled into the space if a Sun-sized body X would encounter it\nby moving at v/c = 10^-4.

This correlation step is the most computationally\nintensive, and becomes more and more difficult as the number of objects to be\ndiscovered increases. In this paper we tested two different algorithms (and the\nrelated prototype software) recently developed to solve the correlation problem\nfor objects in geostationary orbit (GEO), including the accurate orbit\ndetermination by full least squares solutions with all six orbital elements.\nBecause of the presence in the GEO region of a significant subpopulation of\nhigh area to mass objects, strongly affected by non-gravitational\nperturbations, it was actually necessary to solve also for dynamical parameters\ndescribing these effects, that is to fit between 6 and 8 free parameters for\neach orbit. The validation was based upon a set of real data, acquired from the\nESA Space Debris Telescope (ESASDT) at the Teide observatory (Canary Islands).\nWe proved that it is possible to assemble a set of sparse observations into a\nset of objects with orbits, starting from a sparse time distribution of\nobservations, which would be compatible with a survey capable of covering the\nregion of interest in the sky just once per night. This could result in a\nsignificant reduction of the requirements for a future telescope network, with\nrespect to what would have been required with the previously known algorithm\nfor correlation and orbit determination.\n",

Standard Hurst analysis yields $H \\approx 0.9$, which\nsuggests strong LRP. However, solar activity time series are non-stationary due\nto the almost periodic 11 year smooth component, and the analysis does not give\nthe correct $H$ for the stochastic component. Better estimates are obtained by\ndetrended fluctuations analysis (DFA), but estimates are biased and errors are\nlarge due to the short time records. These time series can be modeled as a\nstochastic process of the form $x(t)=y(t)+\\sigma \\sqrt{y(t)}\\, w_H(t)$, where\n$y(t)$ is the smooth component, and $w_H(t) $ is a stationary fractional noise\nwith Hurst exponent $H$. From ensembles of numerical solutions to the\nstochastic model, and application of Bayes' theorem, we can obtain bias and\nerror bars on $H$ and also a test of the hypothesis that a process is\nuncorrelated ($H=1/2$). The conclusions from the present data sets are that\nSSN, TSI and TSI reconstruction almost certainly are long-range persistent, but\nwith most probable value $H\\approx 0.7$. The SFI process, however, is either\nvery weakly persistent ($H<0.6$) or completely uncorrelated.

This mission is an ESA/JAXA joint project with very challenging\nobjectives regarding geodesy, geophysics and fundamental physics. In the\nneighborhood of Mercury, the s/c will experience strong solar radiation\npressure torques; the s/c attitude is controlled by inertial wheels that after\nsome time reach their maximum rotation state. Then they have to be slowed down\nby means of thruster pulses, inducing a residual acceleration on the s/c, with\na desaturation (or off-loading) maneuver. In this paper, we will show how such\nmaneuvers affect the orbit of the s/c and the radio science measurements and,\nalso, how to include them in the orbit determination and parameter estimation\nprocedure. The non linear least squares fit we consider is applied on a set of\nobservational arcs separated by intervals of time where the probe is not\nvisible. With the current baseline of two ground stations, two maneuvers are\nperformed per day, one during the observing session, the other in the dark. To\nreach the scientific goals of the mission, they have to be treated as \"solve\nfor quantities\". We have developed a specific methodology based on the\ndeterministic propagation of the orbit, which is able to deal with these\nvariables, by connecting subsequent observational arcs in a smooth way. The\nnumerical simulations we will show demonstrate that this constrained multi-arc\nstrategy is able to determine the maneuvers, including the ones in the dark,\ntogether with the other parameters of interest at a high level of accuracy.

Their small diameters and modest density enhancements make them\ndifficult to observe, and there is limited evidence for any of the several\nformation mechanisms proposed to date. We present a case study of an event on\n26 August 2014 where a travelling ionospheric disturbance (TID) shortly\nprecedes the formation of a complex collection of field-aligned ducts, using\ndata obtained by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope. Their\nspatiotemporal proximity leads us to suggest a causal interpretation.\nGeomagnetic conditions were quiet at the time, and no obvious triggers were\nnoted. Growth of the structures proceeds rapidly, within 0.5 hr of the passage\nof the TID, attaining their peak prominence 1-2 hr later and persisting for\nseveral more hours until observations ended at local dawn. Analyses of the next\ntwo days show field-aligned structures to be preferentially detectable under\nquiet rather than active geomagnetic conditions. We used a raster scanning\nstrategy facilitated by the speed of electronic beamforming to expand the\nquasi-instantaneous field of view of the MWA by a factor of three. These\nobservations represent the broadest angular coverage of the ionosphere by a\nradio telescope to date.\n",

Predicting the strength and duration of Bz inside a CME with sufficient\naccuracy is currently impossible, which forms the so-called Bz problem. Here,\nwe provide a proof-of-concept of a new method for predicting the CME arrival\ntime, speed, Bz and the resulting Dst index at Earth based only on magnetic\nfield data, measured in situ in the inner heliosphere (< 1AU). On 2012 June\n12-16, three approximately Earthward-directed and interacting CMEs were\nobserved the by the STEREO imagers, and by Venus Express (VEX) in situ at 0.72\nAU, 6 degree away from the Sun Earth line. The CME kinematics are calculated\nusing the drag-based and WSA-Enlil models, constrained by the arrival time at\nVEX, resulting in the CME arrival time and speed at Earth. The CME magnetic\nfield strength is scaled with a power law from VEX to Wind. Our investigation\nshows promising results for the Dst forecast (predicted: -96 and -114 nT (from\n2 Dst models), observed: -71 nT), for the arrival speed (predicted: 531 +- 23\nkm s-1, observed: 488 +- 30 km s-1) and timing (6 +- 1 hours after actual\narrival time). The prediction lead time is 21 hours. The method may be applied\nto vector magnetic field data from a spacecraft at an artificial Lagrange point\nbetween the Sun and Earth, or to data taken by any spacecraft temporarily\ncrossing the Sun--Earth line.\n",

        "summary": "  A ground-based neutron monitor is a standard tool to measure cosmic ray\nvariability near Earth, and it is crucially important to know its yield\nfunction for primary cosmic rays. Although there are several earlier\ntheoretically calculated yield functions, none of them agrees with experimental\ndata of latitude surveys of sea-level neutron monitors, thus suggesting for an\ninconsistency. A newly computed yield function of the standard sea-level 6NM64\nneutron monitor is presented here separately for primary cosmic ray protons and\n$\\alpha-$particles, the latter representing also heavier species of cosmic\nrays. The computations have been done using the GEANT-4 Planetocosmics\nMonte-Carlo tool and a realistic curved atmospheric model. For the first time,\nan effect of the geometrical correction of the neutron monitor effective area,\nrelated to the finite lateral expansion of the cosmic ray induced atmospheric\ncascade, is considered, that was neglected in the previous studies. This\ncorrection slightly enhances the relative impact of higher-energy cosmic rays\n(energy above 5--10 GeV/nucleon) in neutron monitor count rate. The new\ncomputation finally resolves the long-standing problem of disagreement between\nthe theoretically calculated spatial variability of cosmic rays over the globe\nand experimental latitude surveys. The newly calculated yield function,\ncorrected for this geometrical factor, appears fully consistent with the\nexperimental latitude surveys of neutron monitors performed during three\nconsecutive solar minima in 1976--77, 1986--87 and 1996--97. Thus, we provide a\nnew yield function of the standard sea-level neutron monitor 6NM64 that is\nvalidated against experimental data.\n",

Here we estimate\nseasonal solar wind speeds at 1 AU for the last 100 years using high-latitude\ngeomagnetic measurements and show that they give information on the long-term\nevolution of important structures of the solar large-scale magnetic field, such\nas persistent coronal holes. We find that the centennial evolution of solar\nwind speed at 1 AU is different for equinoxes and solstices, reflecting\ndifferences in the evolution of polar coronal hole extensions and isolated\nlow-latitude coronal holes. Equinoctial solar wind speeds had their centennial\nmaximum in 1952, during the declining phase of solar cycle 18, verifying that\npolar coronal holes had exceptionally persistent extensions just before the\npeak of the Grand Modern Maximum of solar activity. On the other hand, solstice\nspeeds had their centennial maximum during the declining phase of solar cycle\n23 due to large low-latitude coronal holes. A similar configuration of seasonal\nspeeds as in cycle 23 was not found earlier, not even during the less active\ncycles of early 20th century. Therefore the exceptional occurrence of\npersistent, isolated low-latitude coronal holes in cycle 23 is not related to\nthe absolute level of sunspot activity but, most likely, to the demise of the\nGrand Modern Maximum.\n",

        "summary": "  A vast wealth of literature exists on the topic of rocket trajectory\noptimisation, particularly in the area of interplanetary trajectories due to\nits relevance today. Studies on optimising interstellar and intergalactic\ntrajectories are usually performed in flat spacetime using an analytical\napproach, with very little focus on optimising interstellar trajectories in a\ngeneral relativistic framework. This paper examines the use of low-acceleration\nrockets to reach galactic destinations in the least possible time, with a\ngenetic algorithm being employed for the optimisation process. The fuel\nrequired for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion\nsystems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the\nMilky Way. The results showed that to limit the amount of fuel carried on\nboard, an antimatter propulsion system would likely be the minimum\ntechnological requirement to reach star systems tens of thousands of light\nyears away. However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several\nhundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time\ndilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel. So for\nnow, it appears that humanity's ultimate goal of a galactic empire may only be\npossible at significantly higher accelerations, though the propulsion\ntechnology requirement for a journey that uses realistic amounts of fuel\nremains to be determined.\n",

        "summary": "  Optimization of low-thrust trajectories that involve a larger number of orbit\nrevolutions is considered a challenging problem. This paper describes a\nhigh-precision symplectic method and optimization techniques to solve the\nminimum-energy low-thrust multi-revolution orbit transfer problem. First, the\noptimal orbit transfer problem is posed as a constrained nonlinear optimal\ncontrol problem. Then, the constrained nonlinear optimal control problem is\nconverted into an equivalent linear quadratic form near a reference solution.\nThe reference solution is updated iteratively by solving a sequence of\nlinear-quadratic optimal control sub-problems, until convergence. Each\nsub-problem is solved via a symplectic method in discrete form. To facilitate\nthe convergence of the algorithm, the spacecraft dynamics are expressed via\nmodified equinoctial elements. Interpolating the non-singular equinoctial\norbital elements and the spacecraft mass between the initial point and end\npoint is proven beneficial to accelerate the convergence process. Numerical\nexamples reveal that the proposed method displays high accuracy and efficiency.\n",

This\nwill result in many obsolete, damaged and abandoned satellites that will remain\non-orbit beyond 25 years. These abandoned satellites and space debris maybe\neconomically valuable orbital real-estate and resources that can be reused,\nrepaired or upgraded for future use. Space traffic management is critical to\nrepair damaged satellites, divert satellites into warehouse orbits and\neffectively de-orbit satellites and space debris that are beyond repair and\nsalvage. Current methods for on-orbit capture, servicing and repair require a\nlarge service satellite. However, by accessing abandoned satellites and space\ndebris, there is an inherent heightened risk of damage to a servicing\nspacecraft. Sending multiple small-robots with each robot specialized in a\nspecific task is a credible alternative, as the system is simple and\ncost-effective and where loss of one or more robots does not end the mission.\nIn this work, we outline an end to end multirobot system to capture damaged and\nabandoned spacecraft for salvaging, repair and for de-orbiting. We analyze the\nfeasibility of sending multiple, decentralized robots that can work\ncooperatively to perform capture of the target satellite as a first step,\nfollowed by crawling onto damage satellites to perform detailed mapping. After\nobtaining a detailed map of the satellite, the robots will proceed to either\nrepair and replace or dismantle components for salvage operations. Finally, the\nremaining components will be packaged with a de-orbit device for accelerated\nde-orbit.\n",

The\nmagnetic field spectra have the spectral slopes between -1.5 to 0 down to\nspatial scales of 20 ion gyroradius and show clear evidence of a transition to\nsteeper spectra for small scales with a second power-law, having slopes between\n-2.6 to -1.8.

        "summary": "  High energy particles originating from solar activity travel along the the\nEarth's magnetic field and interact with the atmosphere around the higher\nlatitudes. These interactions often manifest as aurora in the form of visible\nlight in the Earth's ionosphere. These interactions also result in\nirregularities in the electron density, which cause disruptions in the\namplitude and phase of the radio signals from the Global Navigation Satellite\nSystems (GNSS), known as 'scintillation'. In this paper we use a multi-scale\nresidual autoencoder (Res-AE) to show the correlation between specific dynamic\nstructures of the aurora and the magnitude of the GNSS phase scintillations\n($\\sigma_{\\phi}$). Auroral images are encoded in a lower dimensional feature\nspace using the Res-AE, which in turn are clustered with t-SNE and UMAP. Both\nmethods produce similar clusters, and specific clusters demonstrate greater\ncorrelations with observed phase scintillations. Our results suggest that\nspecific dynamic structures of auroras are highly correlated with GNSS phase\nscintillations.\n",

When the CME reached the Earth, it triggered a super geomagnetic\nstorm (hereafter super storm).

The solar wind parameters responsible for the main phase of the super\nstorm occurred on March 31, 2001 is analyzed taking into account the delayed\ngeomagnetic effect of solar wind at the L1 point and using the SYM-H index.\nAccording to the variation properties of SYM-H index during the main phase of\nthe super storm, the main phase of the super storm is divided into two parts. A\ncomparative study of solar wind parameters responsible for the two parts shows\nthe evidence that the solar wind density plays a significant role in\ntransferring solar wind energy into the magnetosphere, besides the southward\nmagnetic field and solar wind speed.\n",

A forward and a\nreverse shock and a contact discontinuity are self-consistently reproduced. The\nspatial width of the contact discontinuity increases as the angle between the\ndiscontinuity normal and ambient magnetic field decreases. The inner structure\nof the discontinuity shows different profiles between magnetic field and plasma\ndensity, or pressure, which is caused by a non-MHD effect of the local plasma.\nThe region between the two shocks is turbulent. The fluctuations in the\nrelatively dense plasma are compressible and propagating away from the contact\ndiscontinuity, although the fluctuations in the relatively tenuous plasma\ncontain both compressible and incompressible components. The source of the\ncompressible fluctuations in the relatively dense plasma is in the relatively\ntenuous plasma. Only compressible fast mode fluctuations generated in the\nrelatively tenuous plasma are transmitted through the contact discontinuity and\npropagate in the relatively dense plasma. These fast mode fluctuations are\nsteepened when passing the contact discontinuity. This wave steepening and\nprobably other effects may cause the broadening of the wave spectrum in the\nvery local interstellar medium plasma.

Recent high-resolution observations by MMS\n(Magnetospheric Multiscale) spacecraft indicate that MR can occur also in the\nmagnetosheath where the conditions are highly turbulent when the upstream shock\ngeometry is quasi-parallel. The strong turbulent motions make the boundary\nconditions for evolving MR complicated. In this paper it is demonstrated that\nthe wave observations in localized regions of MR can serve as an additional\ndiagnostic tool reinforcing our capacity for identifying MR events in turbulent\nplasmas. It is shown that in a close resemblance with MR at large-scale\nboundaries, turbulent reconnection associated whistler waves occur at\nseparatrix/outflow regions and at the outer boundary of the electron diffusion\nregion, while lower hybrid drift waves are associated with density gradients\nduring the crossing of the current sheet. The lower hybrid drift instability\ncan make the density inhomogeneities rippled.

The waves are\nobliquely propagating close to the resonance cone, with significant electric\nfields parallel to the background magnetic field, enabling strong interactions\nwith electrons. Propagation angles are distinctly different from whistlers\nusually observed in the solar wind, and amplitudes are significantly larger.\nWaves occur most often in association with stream interaction regions (SIRs),\nand are often close-packed. 68 percent of the 54 SIRs had narrowband whistler\ngroups; 33 percent of the nine interplanetary coronal mass ejections had\ncoherent groups. Although wave occurrence as a function of the electron\ntemperature anisotropy and parallel beta is constrained by the thresholds for\nthe whistler temperature anisotropy and firehose instabilities, neither is\nconsistent with observed wave properties. We show for the first time that\ncomparisons of wave data to thresholds for the electron beam driven instability\n(beam speed greater than twice the electron Alfven speed) and to the whistler\nheat flux fan instability indicate that either might destabilize the narrowband\nwaves. In contrast, the less coherent waves, on average, are associated with\nzero or near zero heat flux and much higher electron Alfven speeds, without\nhigher energy beams. This suggests that the less coherent waves may be more\neffective in regulating the electron heat flux, or that the scattering and\nenergization of solar wind electrons by the narrowband waves results in\nbroadening of the waves. The highly oblique propagation and large amplitudes of\nboth the narrowband and less coherent whistlers enable resonant interactions\nwith electrons over a broad energy range, and, unlike parallel whistlers does\nnot require that the electrons and waves counter-propagate.\n",

THEMIS all-sky\nimager data show a fast and clear poleward auroral expansion in the first case,\nwhich does not clearly occur in the second case. Strong field-aligned currents\ncomputed with the spherical elementary current system (SECS) technique occur in\nboth cases, but the current variations resulting from the inclined shock impact\nare weaker and slower compared to the nearly frontal case. SECS analyses also\nreveal that geographic areas with d$B$/d$t$ surpassing the thresholds 1.5 and 5\nnT/s, usually linked to high-risk GICs, are larger and occur earlier due to the\nsymmetric compression caused by the nearly head-on impact. These results, with\nprofound space weather implications, suggest that shock impact angles affect\nthe geospace driving conditions and the location and intensity of the\nsubsequent d$B$/d$t$ variations during substorm activity.\n",

Curiously during these intervals, their impact on measures of\nthe Earth's response, like the polar cap index, is not as high as expected.\nTheorists have put forward a host of explanations for this saturation effect,\nbut there is no consensus. Here we show that the saturation is merely a\nperception created by uncertainty in the solar wind measurements, especially in\nthe measurement times. Correcting for the uncertainty reveals that extreme\nspace weather events elicit a ~300% larger impact than previously thought.\nFurthermore, they point to a surprisingly general result relevant to any\ncorrelation study: uncertainty in the measurement time can cause a system's\nlinear response to be perceived as non-linear.\n",

The ULF wave foreshocks develop upstream of all of them. The\nwavelength and the amplitude of the upstream waves exhibit a complex dependence\non the shock's M$_A$ and $\\theta_{BN}$. The wavelength positively correlates\nwith both parameters, with the dependence on $\\theta_{BN}$ being much stronger.\nThe amplitude of the ULF waves is proportional to the product of the reflected\nbeam velocity and density, which also depend on M$_A$ and $\\theta_{BN}$. The\ninteraction of the ULF waves with the shock causes large-scale (several tens of\nupstream ion inertial lengths) shock rippling. The properties of the shock\nripples are related to the ULF wave properties, namely thier wavelength and\namplitude. In turn, the ripples have a large impact on the ULF wave\ntransmission across the shock because they change local shock properties\n($\\theta_{BN}$, strength), so that different sections of the same ULF wave\nfront encounter shock with different characteristics. Downstream fluctuations\ndo not resemble the upstream waves in terms the wavefront extension,\norientation or their wavelength. However some features are conserved in the\nFourier spectra of downstream compressive waves that present a bump or\nflattening at wavelengths approximately corresponding to those of the upstream\nULF waves.

This process\ncan be described by the Parker equation, which calculates the phase space\ndistribution of GCRs depending on the main modulation processes: convection,\ndrifts, diffusion and adiabatic energy changes. A first order approximation of\nthis equation is the force field approach, reducing it to a one-parameter\ndependency, the solar modulation potential $\\phi$. Utilizing this approach, it\nis possible to reconstruct $\\phi$ from ground based and spacecraft\nmeasurements. However, it has been shown previously that $\\phi$ depends not\nonly on the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) but also on the energy range of\ninterest. We have investigated this energy dependence further, using published\nproton intensity spectra obtained by PAMELA as well as heavier nuclei\nmeasurements from IMP-8 and ACE/CRIS. Our results show severe limitations at\nlower energies including a strong dependence on the solar magnetic epoch. Based\non these findings, we will outline a new tool to describe GCR proton spectra in\nthe energy range from a few hundred MeV to tens of GeV over the last solar\ncycles.

The 3D model is\nused to distinguish between the dominant mechanisms responsible for the\nheliospheric modulation of Galactic positrons, and to understand the effect of\nparticle drift during this unusual minimum in particular, which is considered\ndiffusion dominant, even though particle drift still had a significant role in\nmodulating positrons. Lastly, the expected intensity of Galactic positrons\nduring an A>0 polarity minimum, with similar heliospheric conditions than for\n2006-2009, is predicted to be higher than what was observed by PAMELA for the\n2006-2009 unusual minimum.\n",

To interpret the measurements,\nthe observational and solar illumination geometry must be considered. We use\nforward models of upper atmosphere density and composition, photoelectron\nimpact, airglow emissions, radiative transfer, and line-of-sight integration,\nto describe the expected observations, and here test those calculations against\nobservations near the terminator, and near the limb. On the night side of the\nterminator, broad regions of faint airglow are seen, particularly near the\nwinter solstice. These are caused by photoelectrons that were transported along\nfield lines from magnetically conjugate areas in the other hemisphere, where\nthose areas are still illuminated. We perform model calculations to demonstrate\nthat this process is the source of the emission, and obtain good agreement with\nits morphology and intensity. In some regions, the observed emissions are not\nas intense as the model simulations. Some of the reductions in electron flux\nare explained by changes in magnetic field strength; in other cases,\nparticularly at high magnetic latitude, the cause is unknown, but must occur\nalong extended field lines as they reach into the plasma sheet.\n",

After analysing spectra of\ngeomagnetic field measurements and GICs in several power systems, preliminary\nresults indicate that the GIC spectra depend on the magnitude and frequency\nspectrum of the geomagnetic disturbance, the earth conductivity and the\nelectrical characteristics of the network.

        "summary": "  We demonstrate that global observations of high-energy cosmic rays contribute\nto understanding unique characteristics of a large-scale magnetic flux rope\ncausing a magnetic storm in August 2018. Following a weak interplanetary shock\non 25 August 2018, a magnetic flux rope caused an unexpectedly large\ngeomagnetic storm. It is likely that this event became geoeffective because the\nflux rope was accompanied by a corotating interaction region and compressed by\nhigh-speed solar wind following the flux rope. In fact, a Forbush decrease was\nobserved in cosmic-ray data inside the flux rope as expected, and a significant\ncosmic-ray density increase exceeding the unmodulated level before the shock\nwas also observed near the trailing edge of the flux rope. The cosmic-ray\ndensity increase can be interpreted in terms of the adiabatic heating of cosmic\nrays near the trailing edge of the flux rope, as the corotating interaction\nregion prevents free expansion of the flux rope and results in the compression\nnear the trailing edge. A northeast-directed spatial gradient in the cosmic-ray\ndensity was also derived during the cosmic-ray density increase, suggesting\nthat the center of the heating near the trailing edge is located northeast of\nEarth. This is one of the best examples demonstrating that the observation of\nhigh-energy cosmic rays provides us with information that can only be derived\nfrom the cosmic ray measurements to observationally constrain the\nthree-dimensional macroscopic picture of the interaction between coronal mass\nejections and the ambient solar wind, which is essential for prediction of\nlarge magnetic storms.\n",

        "summary": "  Solar wind parameters play a dominant role in reconnection rate, which\ncontrols the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling efficiency at Earth's\nmagnetopause. Besides, low-energy ions from the ionosphere, frequently detected\non the magnetospheric side of the magnetopause, also affect magnetic\nreconnection. However, the specific role of low-energy ions in reconnection is\nstill an open question under active discussion. In the present work, we report\nin situ observations of a multiscale, multi-type magnetopause reconnection in\nthe presence of low-energy ions using NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale data on\n11 September 2015. This study divides ions into cold and hot populations. The\nobservations can be interpreted as a secondary reconnection dominated by\nelectrons and cold ions located at the edge of an ion-scale reconnection. This\nanalysis demonstrates a dominant role of cold ions in the secondary\nreconnection without hot ions' response. Cold ions and electrons are\naccelerated and heated by the secondary process. The case study provides\nobservational evidence for the simultaneous operation of antiparallel and\ncomponent reconnection. Our results imply that the pre-accelerated and heated\ncold ions and electrons in the secondary reconnection may participate in the\nprimary ion-scale reconnection affecting the solar wind-magnetopause coupling\nand the complicated magnetic field topology affect the reconnection rate.\n",

        "summary": "  Space weather and its impact on infrastructure presents a clear risk in the\nmodern era, as evidenced by the adverse effects of geomagnetically induced\ncurrents (GICs) in power networks. To model GICs, ground-based geomagnetic\nfield (B-field) measurements are critical and need to be available in the\nregion of interest. A challenge globally lies in the sparse distribution of\nmagnetometer arrays, which are seldom located near critical power network\nnodes. Interpolation of the geomagnetic field (B-field) is often needed, with\nthe spherical elementary current system (SECS) approach developed for\nhigh-latitude regions favoured. We adapt this interpolation scheme to include\nlow-cost variometers to interpolate dB/dt directly and increase interpolation\naccuracy. A further adaptation to the scheme is to physically represent the\nmid-latitude context where most power networks and pipelines lie. The driving\ncurrent systems in these regions differ from their high-latitude counterparts.\nUsing a physics-consistent mid-latitude version of SECS, we show why previous\nimplementations in Southern Africa are incorrect but still result in useful\ninterpolation. The scope of these adaptations not only has direct application\nto research in general, but also to utilities, where effective low-cost\ninstrumentation can be used to improve GIC modelling accuracy.\n",

Hence, computational models to forecast GICs\nglobally with large forecast horizon, high spatial resolution and temporal\ncadence are of increasing importance to perform prompt necessary mitigation.\nSince GIC data is proprietary, the time variability of horizontal component of\nthe magnetic field perturbation (dB/dt) is used as a proxy for GICs. In this\nwork, we develop a fast, global dB/dt forecasting model, which forecasts 30\nminutes into the future using only solar wind measurements as input. The model\nsummarizes 2 hours of solar wind measurement using a Gated Recurrent Unit, and\ngenerates forecasts of coefficients which are folded with a spherical harmonic\nbasis to enable global forecasts. When deployed, our model produces results in\nunder a second, and generates global forecasts for horizontal magnetic\nperturbation components at 1-minute cadence. We evaluate our model across\nmodels in literature for two specific storms of 5 August 2011 and 17 March\n2015, while having a self-consistent benchmark model set. Our model\noutperforms, or has consistent performance with state-of-the-practice high time\ncadence local and low time cadence global models, while also\noutperforming/having comparable performance with the benchmark models. Such\nquick inferences at high temporal cadence and arbitrary spatial resolutions may\nultimately enable accurate forewarning of dB/dt for any place on Earth,\nresulting in precautionary measures to be taken in an informed manner.\n",

Investigations of auroras and\ngeospace comprise the main research goals of the Suomi 100 nanosatellite, the\nfirst Finnish space research satellite, which has been measuring the Earth's\nionosphere since its launch on Dec. 3, 2018. In this work, we present a case\nstudy where the satellite's camera observations of an aurora over Northern\nEurope are combined with ground-based observations of the same event. The\nanalyzed image is, to the authors' best knowledge, the first auroral image ever\ntaken by a cubesat. Our data analysis shows that a satellite vantage point\nprovides complementary, novel information of such phenomena. The 3D auroral\nlocation reconstruction of the analyzed auroral event demonstrates how\ninformation from a 2D image can be used to provide location information of\nauroras under study. The location modelling also suggests that the Earth's limb\ndirection, which was the case in the analyzed image, is an ideal direction to\nobserve faint auroras. Although imaging on a small satellite has some large\ndisadvantages compared with ground-based imaging (the camera cannot be\nrepaired, a fast moving spinning satellite), the data analysis and modelling\ndemonstrate how even a small 1-Unit (size: 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) CubeSat and\nits camera, build using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components, can open new\npossibilities for auroral research, especially, when its measurements are\ncombined with ground-based observations.\n",

We have conducted a\ntransionospheric HF-propagation research campaign with a nanosatellite on a\nlow-Earth polar orbit and the EISCAT HF transmitter facility in Troms{\\o},\nNorway, in December 2020. In the active measurement, the EISCAT HF facility\ntransmitted sinusoidal 7.953 MHz signal which was received with the HEARER\nradio spectrometer onboard 1 Unit (size: 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) Suomi 100 space\nweather nanosatellite. Data analysis showed that the EISCAT HF signal was\ndetected with the satellite's radio spectrometer when the satellite was the\nclosest to the heater along its orbit. Part of the observed variations seen in\nthe signal was identified to be related to the heater's antenna pattern and to\nthe transmitted pulse shapes. Other observed variations can be related to the\nspatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere and its different responses\nto the used transmission frequencies and to the transmitted O- and X-wave\nmodes. Some trends in the observed signal may also be associated to changes in\nthe properties of ionospheric plasma resulting from the heater's\nelectromagnetic wave energy.

First, a physical model for dust collection considering a\nPoisson process is formulated. Second, it is shown that dust on hyperbolic\norbits is responsible for the majority of dust detections with Solar Orbiter's\nRadio and Plasma Waves (SolO/RPW). Third, the model for dust counts is fitted\nto SolO/RPW data and parameters of the dust are inferred, namely: radial\nvelocity, hyperbolic meteoroids predominance, and solar radiation pressure to\ngravity ratio as well as uncertainties of these. Non-parametric model fitting\nis used to get the difference between inbound and outbound detection rate and\ndust radial velocity is thus estimated. A hierarchical Bayesian model is\nformulated and applied to available SolO/RPW data. The model uses the\nmethodology of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, estimating parameters\nof dust and their uncertainties. SolO/RPW dust observations can be modelled as\na Poisson process in a Bayesian framework and observations up to this date are\nconsistent with the hyperbolic dust model with an additional background\ncomponent. Analysis suggests a radial velocity of the hyperbolic component\naround $(63 \\pm 7) \\mathrm{km/s}$ with the predominance of hyperbolic dust\nabout $(78 \\pm 4) \\%$. The results are consistent with hyperbolic meteoroids\noriginating between $0.02 \\mathrm{AU}$ and $0.1 \\mathrm{AU}$ and showing\nsubstantial deceleration, which implies effective solar radiation pressure to\ngravity ratio $\\gtrsim 0.5$.

        "summary": "  The large-scale magnetic structure of interplanetary coronal mass ejections\n(ICMEs) has been shown to cause decreases in the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux\nmeasured in situ by spacecraft, known as Forbush decreases (Fds). We use\nmeasurements of the GCR count rate obtained by MESSENGER during its orbital\nphase around Mercury to identify such Fds related to the passage of ICMEs and\ncharacterize their structure. Of the 42 ICMEs with corresponding high-quality\nGCR data, 79% are associated with a Fd. Thus a total of 33 ICME-related Fds\nwere identified, 24 of which (73%) have a two-step structure. We use a\nsuperposed epoch analysis to build an average Fd profile at MESSENGER and find\nthat despite the variability of individual events, a two-step structure is\nproduced and is directly linked with the magnetic boundaries of the ICME. By\nusing results from previous studies at Earth and Mars, we also address whether\ntwo-step Fds are more commonly observed closer to the Sun; we found that\nalthough likely, this is not conclusive when comparing to the wide range of\nresults of previous studies conducted at Earth. Finally, we find that the\npercentage decrease in GCR flux of the Fd is greater at MESSENGER on average\nthan at Earth and Mars, decreasing with increasing heliocentric distance. The\nrelationship between the percentage decrease and maximum hourly decrease is\nalso in agreement with previous studies, and follows trends relating to the\nexpansion of ICMEs as they propagate through the heliosphere.\n",

        "summary": "  The arrival time prediction of Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is an area of\nactive research. Many methods with varying levels of complexity have been\ndeveloped to predict CME arrival. However, the mean absolute error (MAE) of\npredictions remains above 12 hours, even with the increasing complexity of\nmethods. In this work we develop a new method for CME arrival time prediction\nthat uses magnetohydrodynamic simulations involving data-constrained\nflux-rope-based CMEs, which are introduced in a data-driven solar wind\nbackground. We found that, for 6 CMEs studied in this work, the MAE in arrival\ntime was ~8 hours. We further improved our arrival time predictions by using\nensemble modeling and comparing the ensemble solutions with STEREO-A&B\nheliospheric imager data. This was done by using our simulations to create\nsynthetic J-maps. A machine learning (ML) method called the lasso regression\nwas used for this comparison. Using this approach, we could reduce the MAE to\n~4 hours. Another ML method based on the neural networks (NNs) made it possible\nto reduce the MAE to ~5 hours for the cases when HI data from both STEREO-A&B\nwere available. NNs are capable of providing similar MAE when only the STEREO-A\ndata is used. Our methods also resulted in very encouraging values of standard\ndeviation (precision) of arrival time. The methods discussed in this paper\ndemonstrate significant improvements in the CME arrival time predictions. Our\nwork highlights the importance of using ML techniques in combination with\ndata-constrained magnetohydrodynamic modeling to improve space weather\npredictions.\n",

The IBEX-Hi instrument onboard IBEX provides\nfull-sky maps of ENA fluxes produced in the heliosphere and very local\ninterstellar medium (VLISM) through charge exchange of suprathermal ions with\ninterstellar neutral atoms. The first IBEX-Hi results showed that in addition\nto the anticipated globally distributed flux (GDF), a narrow and bright\nemission from a circular region in the sky, dubbed the IBEX ribbon, is visible\nin all energy steps. While the GDF is mainly produced in the inner heliosheath,\nample evidence indicates that the ribbon forms outside the heliopause in the\nregions where the interstellar magnetic field is perpendicular to the lines of\nsight. The IBEX maps produced by the mission team distribute the observations\ninto $6\\deg\\times6\\deg$ rectangle pixels in ecliptic coordinates. The overlap\nof the GDF and ribbon components complicates qualitative analyses of each\nsource. Here, we find the spherical harmonic representation of the IBEX maps,\nseparating the GDF and ribbon components. This representation describes the ENA\nflux components in the sky without relying on any pixelization scheme. Using\nthis separation, we discuss the temporal evolution of each component over the\nsolar cycle. We find that the GDF is characterized by larger spatial scale\nstructures than the ribbon. However, we identify two isolated, small-scale\nsignals in the GDF region that require further study.\n",

The detection of helium atoms\nis made through negative hydrogen (H$^-$) ions sputtered by the helium atoms\nfrom the IBEX-Lo conversion surface. The energy spectrum of ions sputtered by\nISN helium atoms is broad and overlaps the four lowest IBEX-Lo electrostatic\nanalyzer (ESA) steps. Consequently, the energy response function for helium\natoms does not correspond to the nominal energy step transmission. Moreover,\nlaboratory calibration is incomplete because it is difficult to produce\nnarrow-energy neutral atom beams that are expected for ISN helium atoms. Here,\nwe analyze the ISN helium observations in ESA steps 1-4 to derive the relative\nin-flight response of IBEX-Lo to helium atoms. We compare the ratios of the\nobserved count rates as a function of the mean ISN helium atom energy estimated\nusing the Warsaw Test Particle Model (WTPM). The WTPM uses a global heliosphere\nmodel to calculate charge exchange gains and losses to estimate the secondary\nISN helium population. We find that the modeled mean energies of ISN helium\natoms, unlike their modeled fluxes, are not very sensitive to the very local\ninterstellar medium parameters. The obtained relative responses supplement the\nlaboratory calibration and enable more detailed quantitative studies of the ISN\nhelium signal. A similar procedure that we applied to the IBEX-Lo observations\nmay be used to complement laboratory calibration of the next-generation IMAP-Lo\ninstrument on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission.\n",

Through global field line tracing with MAVEN\nmagnetic field data we find an altitude dependent draping morphology that\ndiffers from expectations of induced magnetospheres in the vertical ($\\hat Z$\nMars Sun-state, MSO) direction. We quantify this difference from the classical\npicture of induced magnetospheres with a Bayesian multiple linear regression\nmodel to predict the draped field as a function of the upstream interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF), remanent crustal fields, and a previously underestimated\ninduced effect. From our model we conclude that unexpected twists in high\naltitude dayside draping ($>$800 km) are a result of the IMF component in the\n$\\pm \\hat X$ MSO direction. We propose that this is a natural outcome of\ncurrent theories of induced magnetospheres but has been underestimated due to\napproximations of the IMF as solely $\\pm \\hat Y$ directed. We additionally\nestimate that distortions in low altitude ($<$800 km) dayside draping along\n$\\hat Z$ are directly related to remanent crustal fields. We show dayside\ndraping traces down tail and previously reported inner magnetotail twists are\nlikely caused by the crustal field of Mars, while the outer tail morphology is\ngoverned by an induced response to the IMF direction.

Many policy\ninitiatives have been proposed that attempt to address the problem from\ndifferent angles, but there is a paucity of analytical tools to help\npolicymakers evaluate the efficacy of these different proposals and any\npotential counterproductive outcomes. To help address this problem, this paper\nsummarizes work done to develop an experimental integrated assessment model --\nOrbital Debris Propagators Unified with Economic Systems (OPUS) -- that\ncombines both astrodynamics of the orbital population and economic behavior of\nspace actors. For a given set of parameters, the model first utilizes a given\nastrodynamic propagator to assess the state of objects in orbit. It then uses a\nset of user-defined economic and policy parameters -- e.g. launch prices,\ndisposal regulations -- to model how actors will respond to the economic\nincentives created by a given scenario. For the purposes of testing, the MIT\nOrbital Capacity Tool (MOCAT) version 4S was used as the primary astrodynamics\npropagator to simulate the true expected target collision probability ($p_c$)\nfor a given end-of-life (EOL) disposal plan. To demonstrate\npropagator-agnosticism, a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density\n(GMPHD) filter was also used to simulate $p_c$. We also explore economic policy\ninstruments to improve both sustainability of and economic welfare from orbit\nuse. In doing so, we demonstrate that this hybrid approach can serve as a\nuseful tool for evaluating policy proposals for managing orbital congestion.

        "summary": "  How the solar wind influences the magnetospheres of the outer planets is a\nfundamentally important question, but is difficult to answer in the absence of\nconsistent, simultaneous monitoring of the upstream solar wind and the\nlarge-scale dynamics internal to the magnetosphere. To compensate for the\nrelative lack of in-situ data, propagation models are often used to estimate\nthe ambient solar wind conditions at the outer planets for comparison to remote\nobservations or in-situ measurements. This introduces another complication: the\npropagation of near-Earth solar wind measurements introduces\ndifficult-to-assess uncertainties. Here, we present the Multi-Model Ensemble\nSystem for the outer Heliosphere (MMESH) to begin to address these issues,\nalong with the resultant multi-model ensemble (MME) of the solar wind\nconditions near Jupiter. MMESH accepts as input any number of solar wind models\ntogether with contemporaneous in-situ spacecraft data. From these, the system\ncharacterizes typical uncertainties in model timing, quantifies how these\nuncertainties vary under different conditions, attempts to correct for\nsystematic biases in the input model timing, and composes a MME with\nuncertainties from the results. For the case of the Jupiter-MME presented here,\nthree solar wind propagation models were compared to in-situ measurements from\nthe near-Jupiter spacecraft Ulysses and Juno which span diverse geometries and\nphases of the solar cycle, amounting to more than 14,000 hours of data over 2.5\ndecades. The MME gives the most-probable near-Jupiter solar wind conditions for\ntimes within the tested epoch, outperforming the input models and returning\nquantified estimates of uncertainty.\n",

Specifically, the Long-Short Term Memory recurrent\nneural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time\nseries, is employed in the analysis of in-situ measurements of solar wind\nplasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from $2005$\nto $2019$, at the Lagrangian point L$1$. The problem is approached as a binary\nclassification aiming to predict one hour in advance a decrease in the SYM-H\ngeomagnetic activity index below the threshold of $-50$ nT, which is generally\nregarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class\nimbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to\noptimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network.\nBeside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to\nevaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced\nhere, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the\ncontent of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated\nwith their detection and likelihood of geo-effectiveness, were considered as\ninput features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are\ndemonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the\nmost relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model.\nThe optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting\nthe onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real\nwarnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.\n",

At energy injection scales, both\noutgoing and ingoing modes exhibit a weak cascade; a simultaneous tightening of\nSDDA is noted. Outgoing modes persist in a weak cascade across the inertial\nrange, while ingoing modes shift to a strong cascade at $\\lambda \\approx 3\n\\times 10^{4} d_i$, with associated spectral scalings deviating from expected\nbehavior due to \"anomalous coherence\" effects. The inertial range comprises two\ndistinct sub-inertial segments. Beyond $\\lambda \\gtrsim 100 d_i$, eddies adopt\na field-aligned tube topology, with SDDA signatures mainly evident in high\namplitude fluctuations. The scaling exponents $\\zeta_{n}$ of the $n$-th order\nconditional structure functions, orthogonal to both the local mean field and\nfluctuation direction, align with the analytical models of Chandran et al. 2015\nand Mallet et al. 2017, indicating \"multifractal\" statistics and strong\nintermittency; however, scaling in parallel and displacement components is more\nconcave than predicted, possibly influenced by expansion effects. Below\n$\\lambda \\approx 100 d_i$, eddies become increasingly anisotropic, evolving\ninto thin current sheet-like structures. Concurrently, $\\zeta_{n}$ scales\nlinearly with order, marking a shift towards \"monofractal\" statistics. At\n$\\lambda \\approx 8 d_i$, the increase in aspect ratio halts, and the eddies\nbecome quasi-isotropic. This change may signal tearing instability, leading to\nreconnection, or result from energy redirection into the ion-cyclotron wave\nspectrum, aligning with the \"helicity barrier\". Our analysis utilizes 5-point\nstructure functions, proving more effective than the traditional 2-point method\nin capturing steep scaling behaviors at smaller scales.\n",

The reported observation was intriguing as the solar\nstorm that triggered this aurora was moderate and the first such observation\nfrom Indian region in the space-era. In this communication, we investigate such\na unique modern-day observation of low-latitude auroral sighting occurring\nduring the passage of sheath-region of Interplanetary-Coronal-Mass-Ejection,\nutilizing in situ multi-spacecraft particle measurements along with\ngeomagnetic-field observations by ground and satellite-based magnetometers.\nAuroral observations at Hanle coincided with the intense substorm occurrences.\nIt is unequivocally found that the aurora didnt reach India, rather the\nequatorward boundary of the aurora was beyond $ 50^{\\circ} {}N $ GGLat. The\nmulti-instrumental observations enabled us to estimate the altitude of the red\nauroral emissions accurately. The increased flux of low-energy electrons\n($<$100 eV) precipitating at $\\sim 54^{\\circ}N$ GGLat causing red-light\nemissions at higher altitudes ($\\sim$700-950 km) can be visible from Hanle. The\nobserved low-latitude red aurora from India resulted from two factors:\nemissions at higher altitudes in the auroral oval and a slight expansion of the\nauroral oval towards the equator. The precipitating low-energy particles\nresponsible for red auroral emissions mostly originate from the plasma sheet.\nThese particles precipitate due to wave-particle interactions enhanced by\nstrong compression of the magnetosphere during high solar wind pressure. This\nstudy using multi-point observations holds immense importance in providing a\nbetter understanding of low-latitude auroras.\n",

Selected storms were classified into distinct\ngroups based on their recovery characteristics. Using superposed epoch analysis\nand best fit methods, we scrutinized several interplanetary solar wind plasma\nand field parameters/functions. The analysis included single, dual, and\nmultiple interplanetary plasma and field parameters/functions. We determined\nthe most representative characteristic time for the storm's recovery profile by\nfitting an exponential curve. A correlation analysis between Dst and solar wind\nparameters/functions isolated a coupling function ($\\rho^{1/2}$Ey) best\ndescribing the decay rate of the ring current. This shows that the electric\nfield term (Ey) coupled with a viscous term ($\\rho^{1/2}$) plays a pivotal role\nin determining the recovery rate of geomagnetic storms. Additionally, we\nmodeled the complex patterns of Dst recovery in relation to solar wind\nparameters/functions using a second-order polynomial.

Monitoring variations in the IMF upstream of the Earth\nwould provide very important information for the prediction of space weather\neffects, such as effects of solar storms and the solar wind, on human activity.\nIn this study, the IMF between the Sun and Earth was measured daily for the\nfirst time using a cosmic-ray observatory. Cosmic rays mainly consist of\ncharged particles that are deflected as they pass through a magnetic\nfield.Therefore, the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, caused by high-energy charged\ncosmic rays blocked by the Sun and deflected by the magnetic field, can be used\nto explore the transverse IMF between the Sun and Earth. By employing the\npowerful kilometer-square array at the Large High Altitude Air Shower\nObservatory, the cosmic-ray Sun shadows were observed daily with high\nsignificance for the first time. The displacement of the Sun shadow measured in\n2021 correlates well with the transverse IMF component measured in situ by\nspacecraft near the Earth, with a time lag of 3:31 $\\pm$ 0:12 days. The\ndisplacement of the Sun shadow was also simulated using Parker's classic IMF\nmodel, yielding a time lag of 2:06 $\\pm$ 0:04 days.

The probe's unparalleled capabilities to measure\nboth electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the\nnear-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of\nrelativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal\nthat strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher\nintensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration\nof ultra-relativistic electrons.

As a result,\nphysics-based models of the ionosphere and thermosphere have emerged as a\nnecessary tool for the prediction of atmospheric outputs under highly variable\nspace weather conditions.\n  This paper proposes a high-fidelity approach for physics-based space weather\nmodeling based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations using a\nhigh-order discontinuous Galerkin method, combined with a matrix-free strategy\nsuitable for high-performance computing on GPU architectures. The approach\nconsists of a thermospheric model that describes a chemically frozen neutral\natmosphere in non-hydrostatic equilibrium driven by the external excitation of\nthe Sun. A novel set of variables is considered to treat the low densities\npresent in the upper atmosphere and to accommodate the wide range of scales\npresent in the problem. At the same time, and unlike most existing approaches,\nradial and angular directions are treated in a non-segregated approach.\n  The study presents a set of numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy\nof the approximation and validate the current approach against observational\ndata along a satellite orbit, including estimates of established empirical and\nphysics-based models of the ionosphere-thermosphere system.
