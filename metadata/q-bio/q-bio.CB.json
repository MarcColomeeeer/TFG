When cultured on 10-20 um wide adhesive stripes, the motility of C6\nglioma and primary mouse fibroblast cells is diminished. Nevertheless, nuclei\nperform an unexpected auto-reverse motion: when a migrating nucleus approaches\nthe leading edge, it decelerates, changes the direction of motion and\naccelerates to move toward the other end of the elongated cell. During this\nprocess cells show signs of polarization closely following the direction of\nnuclear movement. The observed nuclear movement requires a functioning\nmicrotubular system, as revealed by experiments disrupting the main\ncytoskeletal components with specific drugs. On the basis of our results we\nargue that auto-reverse nuclear migration is due to forces determined by the\ninterplay of microtubule dynamics and the changing position of the microtubule\norganizing center as the nucleus reaches the leading edge. Our assay\nrecapitulates specific features of nuclear migration (cell polarization,\noscillatory nuclear movement), while allows the systematic study of a large\nnumber of individual cells. In particular, our experiments yielded the first\ndirect evidence of reversive nuclear motion in mammalian cells, induced by\nattachment constraints.\n",

This adaptation\nprocess is called the evolution of specificity. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew mathematical model for the evolution of specificity in humoral immunity,\nbased on Jerne's functional, or idiotypic, network. The evolution of\nspecificity is modeled as the dynamic updating of connection weights in a graph\nwhose nodes are related to the network's idiotypes. At the core of this\nweight-updating mechanism are the increase in specificity caused by clonal\nselection and the decrease in specificity due to the insertion of uncorrelated\nidiotypes by the bone marrow.

Here, we present\na novel computational model simulating this cellular decision-process leading\nup to either phenotype based on a molecular interaction network of genes and\nproteins. The model's regulatory network consists of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR), its ligand transforming growth factor-a (TGFa), the\ndownstream enzyme phospholipaseC-gamma (PLCg) and a mitosis-associated response\npathway. This network is activated by autocrine TGFa secretion, and the\nEGFR-dependent downstream signaling this step triggers, as well as modulated by\nan extrinsic nutritive glucose gradient. Employing a framework of mass action\nkinetics within a multiscale agent-based environment, we analyze both the\nemergent multicellular behavior of tumor growth and the single-cell molecular\nprofiles that change over time and space. Our results show that one can indeed\nsimulate the dichotomy between cell migration and proliferation based solely on\nan EGFR decision network. It turns out that these behavioral decisions on the\nsingle cell level impact the spatial dynamics of the entire cancerous system.\nFurthermore, the simulation results yield intriguing experimentally testable\nhypotheses also on the sub-cellular level such as spatial cytosolic\npolarization of PLCg towards an extrinsic chemotactic gradient.

As an early pattern formation step in\nDrosophila embryos, an anterior-posterior gradient of Bicoid (Bcd) induces\nhunchback (hb) expression (Driever et al. 1989; Tautz et al. 1988). In contrast\nto the Bcd gradient, the Hb profile includes information about the scale of the\nembryo. Furthermore, the resulting hb expression pattern shows a much lower\nembryo-to-embryo variability than the Bcd gradient (Houchmandzadeh et al.\n2002). An additional graded posterior repressing activity could theoretically\naccount for the observed scaling. However, we show that such a model cannot\nproduce the observed precision in the Hb boundary, such that a fundamentally\ndifferent mechanism must be at work. We describe and simulate a model that can\naccount for the observed precise generation of the scaled Hb profile in a\nhighly robust manner. The proposed mechanism includes Staufen (Stau), an RNA\nbinding protein that appears essential to precision scaling (Houchmandzadeh et\nal. 2002). In the model, Stau is released from both ends of the embryo and\nrelocalises hb RNA by increasing its mobility. This leads to an effective\ntransport of hb away from the respective Stau sources. The balance between\nthese opposing effects then gives rise to scaling and precision. Considering\nthe biological importance of robust precision scaling and the simplicity of the\nmodel, the same principle may be employed more often during development.\n",

Recent experiments have revealed the\nmolecular correlate of gradient sensing: Frontness molecules, such as PI3P and\nRac, localize at the front end of the cell, and backness molecules, such as Rho\nand myosin II, accumulate at the back of the cell. Importantly, this\nfrontness-backness polarization occurs \"spontaneously\" even if the cells are\nexposed to uniform chemoattractant profiles. The spontaneous polarization\nsuggests that the gradient sensing machinery undergoes a Turing bifurcation.\nThis has led to several classical activator-inhibitor and activator-substrate\nmodels which identify the frontness molecules with the activator. Conspicuously\nabsent from these models is any accounting of the backness molecules. This\nstands in sharp contrast to experiments which show that the backness pathways\ninhibit the frontness pathways. Here, we formulate a model based on the\nmutually inhibitory interaction between the frontness and backness pathways.\nThe model builds upon the mutual inhibition model proposed by Bourne and\ncoworkers (Xu et al, Cell, 114, 201--214, 2003). We show that mutual inhibition\nalone, without the help of any positive feedback, can trigger spontaneous\npolarization of the frontness and backness pathways. The spatial distribution\nof the frontness and backness molecules in response to inhbition and activation\nof the frontness and backness pathways are consistent with those observed in\nexperiments. Furthermore, depending on the parameter values, the model yields\nspatial distributions corresponding to chemoattraction (frontness pathways\nin-phase with the external gradient) and chemorepulsion (frontness pathways\nout-of-phase with the external gradient).\n",

The models permit to mimic experiments with\nlevels of gene expressions not achieved yet, and to predict if the work to\nachieve this levels will significantly increase the quality of oscillations.\nThis give arguments for selecting the directions of the experimental work.\n",

However, the interaction between the\nexcitable cell membrane and IP$_3$-mediated CaOs, which are coupled by\ncytosolic calcium which affects the dynamics of both, has not been studied.\nThis study for the first time applied stability analysis to investigate the\ndynamic behavior of a model, which includes both an excitable membrane and an\nintracellular IP$_3$-mediated calcium oscillator. Taking the IP$_3$\nconcentration as a control parameter, the model exhibits a novel rich spectrum\nof stable and unstable states with hysteresis. The four stable states of the\nmodel correspond in detail to previously reported growth-state dependent states\nof the membrane potential of normal rat kidney fibroblasts in cell culture.

We have modeled the\ndynamics of transport factors and their interaction with the flexible FG-nups\nas diffusion in an effective potential, using both analytical theory and\ncomputer simulations. We show that specific binding of transport factors to the\nFG-nups facilitates transport and provides the mechanism of selectivity. We\nshow that the high selectivity of transport can be accounted for by competition\nfor both binding sites and space inside the NPC, which selects for transport\nfactors over other macromolecules that interact only non-specifically with the\nNPC. We also show that transport is relatively insensitive to changes in the\nnumber and distribution of FG-nups in the NPC, due mainly to their flexibility;\nthis accounts for recent experiments where up to half of the total mass of the\nNPC has been deleted, without abolishing the transport. Notably, we demonstrate\nthat previously established physical and structural properties of the NPC can\naccount for observed features of nucleocytoplasmic transport.

This model describes movement of cell and\nintracellular reactions of activator, inhibitor and actin filaments in a\nunified way.

This model also explains the observed data\nthat the keratocye type cells tend to rapidly move along a straight line. The\nneutrophil type cells move along a straight line when the moving velocity is\nsmall, but they show fluctuated motions deviating from a line when they move as\nfast as the keratocye type cells.

In\nsilcio modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add\nuseful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway.\nHowever, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the\ncellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as\nwell as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment.\n  Results We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics\nof NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular\nlevel, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was\nimplemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger\nphenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between\nextrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic\npatterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth\nfactor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the\ncell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal\nincrease in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether.\n  Conclusions Our in silico results indicate that, in NSCLC, in the presence of\na strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus, and depending on the cell's location,\ndownstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby\nyielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated\nspatio-temporal expansion rate.\n",

Based on dynamical systems theory, we\npropose a mechanism for cell differentiation with regulation of populations of\neach cell type by taking simple cell models with gene expression dynamics. By\nincorporating several interaction kinetics, we found that the cell models with\na single intracellular positive-feedback loop exhibit a cell fate switching,\nwith a change in the total number of cells. The number of a given cell type or\nthe population ratio of each cell type is preserved against the change in the\ntotal number of cells, depending on the form of cell-cell interaction. The\ndifferentiation is a result of bifurcation of cell states via the intercellular\ninteractions, while the population regulation is explained by self-consistent\ndetermination of the bifurcation parameter through cell-cell interactions. The\nrelevance of this mechanism to development and differentiation in several\nmulticellular systems is discussed.\n",

Different entropy production\nbetween two kinds of cells determines the direction of entropy flow among\ncells. The entropy flow is the carrier of information flow. The entropy flow\nfrom cancer to healthy cell takes along the harmful information of cancerous\ncell, propagating its toxic action to healthy tissues. We demonstrate that a\nlow-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic field or ultrasound irradiation\nmay increase the entropy production rate of a cell in normal tissue than that\nin cancer, consequently reverse the direction of entropy current between two\nkinds of cells. The modification of PH value of cells may also cause the\nreversal of the direction of entropy flow between healthy and cancerous cells.\nSo, the biological tissue under the irradiation of electromagnetic field or\nultrasound or under the appropriate change of cell acidity can avoid the\npropagation of harmful information from cancer cells. We suggest that this\nentropy mechanism possibly provides a basis for a novel approach to anticancer\ntherapy.\n",

        "summary": "  Increase in vascular permeability occurs under many physiological conditions\nand is central in diverse human pathologies. Thrombin is a pro-coagulant serine\nprotease, which causes the local loss of endothelial barrier integrity thereby\nenabling the rapid extravasation of plasma proteins and the local formation of\nfibrin-containing clots. Available information suggests that thrombin induces\nendothelial permeability by promoting actomyosin contractility through the\nRho/ROCK signaling pathway. Here we took advantage of pharmacological\ninhibitors, knockdown approaches, and the emerging knowledge on how\npermeability factors affect endothelial junctions to investigate in detail the\nmechanism underlying thrombin-induced endothelial permeability. We show that\nthrombin signals through PAR-1 and its coupled G proteins G(12/13) and G(11/q)\nto induce RhoA activation and intracellular calcium elevation, and that these\nevents are interrelated. In turn, this leads to the stimulation of ROCK, which\ncauses actin stress-fiber formation. However, this alone is not sufficient to\naccount for thrombin-induced permeability. Instead, we found that protein\nkinase C-related kinase, a Rho-dependent S/T kinase, is activated in\nendothelial cells upon thrombin stimulation and that its expression is required\nfor endothelial permeability and remodeling of cell-extracellular matrix and\ncell-cell adhesions. Our results demonstrate that the signal initiated by\nthrombin bifurcates at the level of RhoA to promote changes in the cytoskeletal\narchitecture through ROCK and the remodeling of focal adhesion components\nthrough PRK. Ultimately, both pathways converge to cause cell-cell junction\ndisruption and provoke vascular leakage.\n",

The difficulty is to predict the\neffect, at the macroscopic scale, of contact interactions that take place at\nthe microscopic scale. To address this we use a multiscale approach: starting\nfrom a very simple, yet experimentally validated, microscopic model of\nmigration with contact interactions, we derive a macroscopic model.

For such spontaneous movements, a variety of different modes have been\nobserved, including the amoeboid-like locomotion with protrusion of multiple\npseudopods, the keratocyte-like locomotion with a widely spread lamellipodium,\ncell division with two daughter cells crawling in opposite directions, and\nfragmentations of a cell to multiple pieces. Mutagenesis studies have revealed\nthat cells exhibit these modes depending on which genes are deficient,\nsuggesting that seemingly different modes are the manifestation of a common\nmechanism to regulate cell motion. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that\nthe positive feedback mechanism working through the inhomogeneous distribution\nof regulatory proteins underlies this variety of cell locomotion and\ncytofission. In this hypothesis, a set of regulatory proteins, which we call\ncortical factors, suppress actin polymerization. These suppressing factors are\ndiluted at the extending front and accumulated at the retracting rear of cell,\nwhich establishes a cellular polarity and enhances the cell motility, leading\nto the further accumulation of cortical factors at the rear. Stochastic\nsimulation of cell movement shows that the positive feedback mechanism of\ncortical factors stabilizes or destabilizes modes of movement and determines\nthe cell migration pattern. The model predicts that the pattern is selected by\nchanging the rate of formation of the actin-filament network or the threshold\nto initiate the network formation.\n",

At this scale, cell populations and chemical species are best treated\nas concentration fields that vary with time and space. The cells have\nchemo-mechanical interactions with each other and with the ECM, consume glucose\nand oxygen that are transported through the tumor, and create chemical\nbyproducts. We present a continuum mathematical model for the biochemical\ndynamics and mechanics that govern tumor growth. The biochemical dynamics and\nmechanics also engender free energy changes that serve as universal measures\nfor comparison of these processes. Within our mathematical framework we\ntherefore consider the free energy inequality, which arises from the first and\nsecond laws of thermodynamics. With the model we compute preliminary estimates\nof the free energy rates of a growing tumor in its pre-vascular stage by using\ncurrently available data from single cells and multicellular tumor spheroids.\n",

At the early\nstage of epithelial layer formation, each cell of an aggregate defines an inner\nand an outer side by breaking the symmetry of its initial state, in a process\nknown as epithelial polarization. By integrating recent biochemical and\nbiophysical data with stochastic simulations of the relevant reaction-diffusion\nsystem we provide evidence that epithelial cell polarization is a chemical\nphase separation process induced by a local bistability in the signaling\nnetwork at the level of the cell membrane. The early symmetry breaking event\ntriggering phase separation is induced by adhesion-dependent mechanical forces\nlocalized in the point of convergence of cell surfaces when a threshold number\nof confluent cells is reached. The generality of the emerging phase separation\nscenario is likely common to many processes of cell polarity formation.\n",

Its biochemical mechanism based on methylation and\ndemethylation of chemoreceptors has long been known. Despite the importance of\nadaptation for cell memory and behavior, the dynamics of adaptation are\ndifficult to reconcile with current models of precise adaptation. Here, we\nfollow time courses of signaling in response to concentration step changes of\nattractant using in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements.\nSpecifically, we use a condensed representation of adaptation time courses for\nefficient evaluation of different adaptation models. To quantitatively explain\nthe data, we finally develop a dynamic model for signaling and adaptation based\non the attractant flow in the experiment, signaling by cooperative receptor\ncomplexes, and multiple layers of feedback regulation for adaptation. We\nexperimentally confirm the predicted effects of changing the enzyme-expression\nlevel and bypassing the negative feedback for demethylation.

Mechanisms responsible for\nincreased susceptibility to malaria in pregnant women are not fully understood.\nBaboons are susceptible to Plasmodium knowlesi and their reproductive\nphysiology and host pathogen interactions are similar to those in humans,\nmaking them attractive for development as a model for studying mechanisms\nunderlying pregnancy malaria. This study exploited the susceptibility of\nbaboons to Plasmodium knowlesi infection to characterize cytokine and\nperipheral blood mononuclear cell recall proliferation responses underlying the\npathogenesis of pregnancy malaria in baboons infected with Plasmodium knowlesi.\nThe pregnancies of three time mated adult female baboons and their gestational\nlevels were confirmed by ultrasonography. On the 150th day of gestation, the\npregnant baboons together with four non pregnant controls were infected with\nPlasmodium knowlesi H strain parasites. Collection of peripheral sera, and\nmononuclear cells was then done on a weekly basis. Sera cytokine concentrations\nwere measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) using respective\nenzyme conjugated antibodies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell recall\nproliferation assays were also done on a weekly basis. Results indicate that\npregnancy malaria in this model is associated with suppression of interferon\ngamma and interleukin 6 (IL-6) responses. Tumour necrosis factor alpha\nresponses were upregulated while IL-4, IL-12 and recall proliferation responses\nwere not different from controls.

In these\nwomen, malaria parasites are frequently found sequestered in the placental\nintervillous spaces, a condition referred to as placental malaria (PM).\nPlacental malaria threatens the health of the mother and the child's life by\ncausing still births and reduction in gestational age. An estimated 24 million\npregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa are at risk. Mechanisms responsible for\nincreased susceptibility in pregnant women are not fully understood. Pregnancy\nmalaria studies have been limited by the lack of a suitable animal model. This\nresearch aimed to develop a baboon (Papio anubis) model for studying PM. The\npregnancies of three adult female baboons were synchronized and their\ngestational levels confirmed by ultrasonography. On the 150th day of gestation\nthe pregnant baboons were infected with Plasmodium knowlesi H strain parasites\ntogether with four nulligravid control baboons. Parasitaemia was monitored from\ntwo days post inoculation until the 159th day of gestation when caesarean\nsection was done on one baboon in order to obtain the placenta. Two baboons\naborted their conceptus. Smears prepared from placental blood demonstrated the\npresence of Plasmodium knowlesi parasites in all the three sampled placentas.\nThese new findings show that P. knowlesi sequesters in the baboon placenta. In\naddition, this study has characterized haemoglobin, eosinophil, Immunoglobulin\nG and Immunoglobulin M profiles in this model. Thus a non human primate\n(baboon) model for studying PM has been established. The established baboon -\nP. knowlesi model for studying human placental/pregnancy malaria now offers an\nopportunity for circumventing the obstacles experienced during human studies\nlike having inadequate tissue for analysis, inaccurate estimation of\ngestational age, moral, ethical and financial limitations.\n",

Clinical data suggest that many\nsuch reactions involve immune mechanisms, and genetic association studies have\nidentified strong linkage between drug hypersensitivity reactions to several\ndrugs and specific HLA alleles. One of the strongest such genetic associations\nfound has been for the antiviral drug abacavir, which causes severe adverse\nreactions exclusively in patients expressing the HLA molecular variant B*57:01.\nAbacavir adverse reactions were recently shown to be driven by drug-specific\nactivation of cytokine-producing, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that required\nHLA-B*57:01 molecules for their function. However, the mechanism by which\nabacavir induces this pathologic T cell response remains unclear. Here we show\nthat abacavir can bind within the F-pocket of the peptide-binding groove of\nHLA-B*57:01 thereby altering its specificity. This supports a novel explanation\nfor HLA-linked idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions; namely that drugs can\nalter the repertoire of self-peptides presented to T cells thus causing the\nequivalent of an alloreactive T cell response. Indeed, we identified specific\nself-peptides that are presented only in the presence of abacavir, and that\nwere recognized by T cells of hypersensitive patients. The assays we have\nestablished can be applied to test additional compounds with suspected HLA\nlinked hypersensitivities in vitro. Where successful, these assays could speed\nup the discovery and mechanistic understanding of HLA linked hypersensitivities\nas well as guide the development of safer drugs.\n",

The present work describes the design and functionalization of a\nthree-dimensional (3D) culture support dedicated to the study of neurite\noutgrowth from neural cells. It is based on a dense self-assembled collagen\nmatrix stabilized by 100-nm-wide interconnected native fibrils without chemical\ncrosslinking. The matrices were made suitable for cell manipulation and direct\nobservation in confocal microscopy by anchoring them to traditional glass\nsupports with a calibrated thickness of similar to 50 mu m. The matrix\ncomposition can be readily adapted to specific neural cell types, notably by\nincorporating appropriate neurotrophic growth factors. Both PC-12 and SH-SY5Y\nlines respond to growth factors (nerve growth factor and brain-derived\nneurotrophic factor, respectively) impregnated and slowly released from the\nsupport. Significant neurite outgrowth is reported for a large proportion of\ncells, up to 66% for PC12 and 49% for SH-SY5Y. It is also shown that both\ngrowth factors can be chemically conjugated (EDC/NHS) throughout the matrix and\nyield similar proportions of cells with longer neurites (61% and 52%,\nrespectively). Finally, neurite outgrowth was observed over several tens of\nmicrons within the 3D matrix, with both diffusing and immobilized growth\nfactors. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

These models are\nprimarily electrical, biochemical or mechanical in their orientation, and do\nnot permit a full exploration of how the smooth muscle responds to electrical\nor mechanical forcing. To address this issue, we have developed a new model\nthat consists of two major components: electrochemical and chemomechanical\nsubsystems of the cell. Included in the electrochemical model are models of the\nelectrophysiological behavior of the cell membrane, fluid compartments, Ca2+\nrelease and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and cytosolic Ca2+ buffering,\nparticularly by calmodulin. With this subsystem model, we can study the\nmechanics of the production of intracellular Ca2+ transient in response to\nmembrane voltage clamp pulses. The chemomechanical model includes models of:\n(a) the chemical kinetics of myosin phosphorylation, and the formation of\nphosphorylated myosin cross-bridges with actin, as well as, attached latch-type\ncross-bridges; and (b) a model of force generation and mechanical coupling to\nthe contractile filaments and their attachments to protein structures and the\nskeletal framework of the cell. The two subsystem models are tested\nindependently and compared with data. Likewise, the complete (combined) cell\nmodel responses to voltage pulse stimulation under isometric and isotonic\nconditions are calculated and compared with measured single cell length-force\nand force-velocity data obtained from literature. This integrated cell model\nprovides biophysically-based explanations of electrical, chemical and\nmechanical phenomena in cerebrovascular smooth muscle, and has considerable\nutility as an adjunct to laboratory research and experimental design.\n",

Such behaviour in higher organisms can often be reduced to a few\nstereotyped modes of movement due to physiological limitations, but finding\nsuch modes in amoeboid cells is more difficult as they lack these constraints.\nHere, we examine cell shape and movement in starved Dictyostelium amoebae\nduring migration toward a chemoattractant in a microfluidic chamber. We show\nthat the incredible variety in amoeboid shape across a population can be\nreduced to a few modes of variation. Interestingly, cells use distinct modes\ndepending on the applied chemical gradient, with specific cell shapes\nassociated with shallow, difficult-to-sense gradients.

The\npopulation of a node survives if the number of occupied neighbours is not too\nsmall and not too large. There is an influx of lymphocytes with random idiotype\nfrom the bone marrow. Previous investigations have shown that this system\nevolves toward highly organized architectures, where the nodes can be\nclassified into groups according to their statistical properties. The building\nprinciples of these architectures can be analytically described and the\nstatistical results of simulations agree very well with results of a modular\nmean field theory. In this paper we present simulation results for the case\nthat one or several nodes, playing the role of self, are permanently occupied.\nWe observe that the group structure of the architecture is very similar to the\ncase without self antigen, but organized such that the neighbours of the self\nare only weakly occupied, thus providing self tolerance.

In the\nabsence of signals, cells continuously rebuild the cytoskeleton and\nperiodically extend pseudopods or other protrusions at random membrane\nlocations. Extracellular signals bias the direction of movement by biasing the\nextension of protrusions, but this involves another layer of biochemical\nnetworks for signal detection, transduction, and control of the rebuilding of\nthe cytoskeleton. Here we develop a model for the latter processes that centers\non a Ras-based module that adapts to constant extracellular signals and\ncontrols the downstream PI3K-PIP3-based module responsible for amplifying a\nspatial gradient of the signal. The resulting spatial gradient can lead to\npolarization, which enables cells to move in the preferred direction (up\ngradient for attractants and down-gradient for repellents). We show that the\nmodel can replicate many of the observed characteristics of the responses to\ncAMP stimulation for Dictyostelium, and analyze how cell geometry and signaling\ninteract to produce the observed localization of some of the key components of\nthe amplification module. We show how polarization can emerge without\ndirectional cues, and how it interacts with directional signals and leads to\ndirectional persistence.

We found that such extracellular feedback can generate neurite\nlength oscillations with periodic sequence of elongations and retractions.

We analyzed the characteristics of the\nelongation process for different distributions of attracting and repelling\nsources of the extracellular signal molecules.

Although promising, most mAb\ndrugs are still in trial phases, and the possible variations in the dosing\nschedules of those currently approved for use have not yet been thoroughly\nexplored. To investigate the effectiveness of current mAb treatment schedules,\nand to test hypothetical treatment strategies, we have created a system of\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE) to model colorectal cancer\ngrowth and treatment. The model includes tumor cells, elements of the host's\nimmune response, and treatments. Model treatments include the chemotherapy\nagent irinotecan and one of two monoclonal antibodies - cetuximab, which is\nFDA-approved for colorectal cancer, and panitumumab, which is still being\nevaluated in clinical trials. The model incorporates patient-specific\nparameters to account for individual variations in immune system strength and\nin medication efficacy against the tumor. We have simulated outcomes for groups\nof virtual patients on treatment protocols for which clinical trial data are\navailable, using a range of biologically reasonable patient-specific parameter\nvalues. Our results closely match clinical trial results for these protocols.\nWe also simulated experimental dosing schedules, and have found new schedules\nwhich, in our simulations, reduce tumor size more effectively than current\ntreatment schedules. Additionally, we examined the system's equilibria and\nsensitivity to parameter values. In the absence of treatment, tumor evolution\nis most affected by the intrinsic tumor growth rate and carrying capacity. When\ntreatment is introduced, tumor growth is most affected by drug-specific PK/PD\nparameters.\n",

However,\nthe joint fluctuations relating cell size, doubling time and individual growth\nrate are only starting to be characterized. Recent studies in bacteria (i)\nrevealed the near constancy of the size extension in a single cell cycle (adder\nmechanism), and (ii) reported a universal trend where the spread in both size\nand doubling times is a linear function of the population means of these\nvariables. Here, we combine experiments and theory and use scaling concepts to\nelucidate the constraints posed by the second observation on the division\ncontrol mechanism and on the joint fluctuations of sizes and doubling times. We\nfound that scaling relations based on the means both collapse size and\ndoubling-time distributions across different conditions, and explain how the\nshape of their joint fluctuations deviates from the means. Our data on these\njoint fluctuations highlight the importance of cell individuality: single cells\ndo not follow the dependence observed for the means between size and either\ngrowth rate or inverse doubling time. Our calculations show that these results\nemerge from a broad class of division control mechanisms (including the adder\nmechanism as a particular case) requiring a certain scaling form of the\nso-called \"division hazard rate function\", which defines the probability rate\nof dividing as a function of measurable parameters. This gives a rationale for\nthe universal body-size distributions observed in microbial ecosystems across\nmany microbial species, presumably dividing with multiple mechanisms.\nAdditionally, our experiments show a crossover between fast and slow growth in\nthe relation between individual-cell growth rate and division time, which can\nbe understood in terms of different regimes of genome replication control.\n",

In this study we\ncompare the hierarchical model and the reversible model in predicting the\ncell-state dynamics observed in biological experiments. Our results show that\nthe hierarchical model shows significant disadvantages over the reversible\nmodel in describing both long-term stability (phenotypic equilibrium) and\nshort-term transient dynamics (overshoot) of cancer cells. In a very specific\ncase in which the total growth of population due to each cell type is\nidentical, the hierarchical model predicts neither phenotypic equilibrium nor\novershoot, whereas thereversible model succeeds in predicting both of them.\nEven though the performance of the hierarchical model can be improved by\nrelaxing the specific assumption, its prediction to the phenotypic equilibrium\nstrongly depends on a precondition that may be unrealistic in biological\nexperiments, and it also fails to capture the overshoot of CSCs.

In addition to recapitulating coherent\nrotational motion observed in experiments, our results also show the presence\nof radial movements and tissue behavior that can vary between solid-like and\nfluid-like. We show that the pattern of coherent motion is dictated by the\ncombination of different physical parameters including number density, cell\nmotility, system size, bulk cell stiffness and stiffness of cell-cell\nadhesions. We further observe that, perturbations in the form of cell division\ncan induce a reversal in the direction of motion when cell division occurs\nsynchronously. Moreover, when the confinement is removed, we see that the\nexisting coherent motion leads to cell scattering, with bulk cell stiffness and\nstiffness of cell-cell contacts dictating the invasion pattern. In summary, our\nstudy provides an in-depth understanding of the origin of coherent rotation in\nconfined tissues, and extracts useful insights into the influence of various\nphysical parameters on the pattern of such movements\n",

The challenge lies in relating the LH content of the medium leaving\nthe chamber to the cellular processes producing LH secretion. To investigate\nthis relation we developed and analyzed a mathematical model consisting of\ncoupled partial differential equations describing LH secretion in a perifusion\ncell culture. We match the mathematical model to three different data sets and\ngive cellular mechanisms that explain the data.

How isogenic cell populations maintain size\nhomeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing\nfundamental problem. We model cell size using a stochastic hybrid system, where\na cell grows exponentially in size (volume) over time and probabilistic\ndivision events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever\ndivision events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We\nfirst consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures\nthe time since the last division event regulates both the cellular growth and\ndivision rates. Analysis reveals that such a timer-controlled system cannot\nachieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation\ngrows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for\ncontrolling size we consider two classes of regulation: a size-dependent growth\nrate and a size-dependent division rate. Our results show that these strategies\ncan provide bounded intercellular variation in cell size, and exact\nmathematical conditions on the form of regulation needed for size homeostasis\nare derived. Different known forms of size control strategies, such as, the\nadder and the sizer are shown to be consistent with these results.\nInterestingly, for timer-based division mechanisms, the mean cell size depends\non the noise in the cell-cycle duration but independent of errors incurred in\npartitioning of volume among daughter cells. In contrast, the mean cell size\ndecreases with increasing partitioning errors for size-based division\nmechanisms.

These results demonstrate the mechanisms and\nlimitations of dynamic information storage in cells.\n",

        "summary": "  Cellular phenotype is characterized by different components such as cell\nsize, protein content and cell cycle time. These are global variables that are\nthe outcome of multiple internal microscopic processes. Accordingly, they\ndisplay some universal statistical properties and scaling relations, such as\ndistribution collapse and relation between moments. Cell size statistics and\nits relation to growth and division has been mostly studied separately from\nproteins and other cellular variables. Here we present experimental and\ntheoretical analyses of these phenotype components in a unified framework that\nreveals their correlations and interactions inside the cell. We measure these\ncomponents simultaneously in single cells over dozens of generations, quantify\ntheir correlations, and compare population to temporal statistics. We find that\ncell size and highly expressed proteins have very similar dynamics over growth\nand division cycles, which result in parallel statistical properties, both\nuniversal and individual. In particular, while distribution shapes of\nfluctuations along time are common to all cells and components, other\nproperties are variable and remain distinct in individual cells for a\nsurprisingly large number of generations. These include temporal averages of\ncell size and protein content, and the structure of their auto-correlation\nfunctions. We explore possible roles of the different components in controlling\ncell growth and division. We find that in order to stabilize exponential\naccumulation and division of all components across generations, coupled\ndynamics among them is required. Finally, we incorporate effective coupling\nwithin the cell cycle with a phenomenological mapping across consecutive\ncycles, and show that this model reproduces the entire array of experimental\nobservations.\n",

A node in the network represents a\nclone of B-lymphocytes and its antibodies of the same idiotype which is encoded\nby a bitstring. The links between nodes represent possible interactions between\nclones of almost complementary idiotype. A clone survives only if the number of\npopulated neighbored nodes is neither too small nor too large. The dynamics is\ndriven by the influx of lymphocytes with randomly generated idiotype from the\nbone marrow. Previous work has revealed that the network evolves towards a\nhighly organized modular architecture, characterized by groups of nodes which\nshare statistical properties. The structural properties of the architecture can\nbe described analytically, the statistical properties determined from\nsimulations are confirmed by a modular mean-field theory. To model the presence\nof self we permanently occupy one or several nodes. These nodes influence their\nlinked neighbors, the autoreactive clones, but are themselves not affected by\nidiotypic interactions. The architecture is very similar to the case without\nself, but organized such that the neighbors of self are only weakly occupied,\nthus providing self-tolerance. This supports the perspective that self-reactive\nclones, which regularly occur in healthy organisms, are controlled by\nanti-idiotypic clones. We discuss how perturbations, like an infection with\nforeign antigen, a change in the influx of new idiotypes, or the random removal\nof idiotypes, may lead to autoreactivity and devise protocols which cause a\nreconstitution of the self-tolerant state. The results could be helpful to\nunderstand network and probabilistic aspects of autoimmune disorders.\n",

As a consequence of these\nnon-linear interactions, a diversity of migratory behaviors can be observed in\nmigrating \\phys fragments. To study these dynamics, we measure the\nspatio-temporal distributions of the velocities of the endoplasm and ectoplasm\nof each migrating fragment, the traction stresses it generates on the\nsubstratum, and the concentration of free intracellular calcium. Using these\nunprecedented experimental data, we classify migrating \\phys fragments\naccording to their dynamics, finding that they often exhibit spontaneously\ncoordinated waves of flow, contractility and chemical signaling. We show that\n\\phys fragments exhibiting symmetric spatio-temporal patterns of endoplasmic\nflow migrate significantly slower than fragments with asymmetric patterns. In\naddition, our joint measurements of ectoplasm velocity and traction stress at\nthe substratum suggest that forward motion of the ectoplasm is enabled by a\nsuccession of stick-slip transitions, which we conjecture are also organized in\nthe form of waves.

Mechanisms that underlie stochastic cell fate\nspecification have been analysed in detail in the Drosophila retina. In\ncontrast, the retinas of another group of dipteran flies exhibit highly ordered\npatterns. Species in the Dolichopodidae, the \"long-legged\" flies, have regular\nalternating columns of two types of ommatidia (unit eyes), each producing\ncorneal lenses of different colours.

A potential solution\nis to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We\nconsider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act\ndirectly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth,\nanti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This\nprevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while\nsimultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial\nclearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion\ntherapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule (MAM) 7 coupled\npolystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to\nhost cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a Pseudomonas\naeruginosa burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against in\nvivo data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain\nbacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of\ntreatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model\nconsists of two physical compartments: the epithelium and the exudate. It is\nfound that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor\ntreatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the epithelium\nand by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the epithelium into the\nexudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the\nbacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or\ncontinuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible.\nLastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our\nmathematical model.\n",

Eye formation starts during the fourth week\nof human embryonic life, when the ocular primordium can be distinguished from\nthe lateral diverticula of the anterior brain by complex morphogenetic\nmovements. It requires the input of various germ layers of the embryo:\nneuroectoderm, surface ectoderm, mesoderm and neural crest cells, in order to\nelaborate the different components.

Under normal conditions\ncontact inhibition is associated with the proper functioning tissues, whereas\nabnormal regulation of contact inhibition is associated with pathological\nconditions, such as tumor spreading. Unfortunately, standard mathematical\nmodeling practices mask the importance of parameters that control contact\ninhibition through scaling arguments. Furthermore, standard experimental\nprotocols are insufficient to quantify the effects of contact inhibition\nbecause they focus on data describing early time, low-density dynamics only.\nHere we use the logistic growth equation as a caricature model of contact\ninhibition to make recommendations as to how to best mitigate these issues.\nTaking a Bayesian approach we quantify the trade-off between different features\nof experimental design and estimates of parameter uncertainty so that we can\nre-formulate a standard cell proliferation assay to provide estimates of both\nthe low-density intrinsic growth rate, $\\lambda$, and the carrying capacity\ndensity, $K$, which is a measure of contact inhibition.\n",

However, the mechanisms by which single fibroblasts affect each\nother's directional decisions, while chemotaxing in microscopic tissue pores,\nare not well understood. Therefore, we explored the effects of two types of\nrelevant social interactions on fibroblast PDGF-BB-induced migration in\nmicrofluidic tissue-mimicking mazes: cell sequence and mitosis. Surprisingly,\nit was found that in both cases, the cells display behavior that is\ncontradictory to the chemoattractant gradient established in the maze. In case\nof the sequence, the cells do not like to take the same path through the maze\nas their predecessor, when faced with a bifurcation. To the contrary, they tend\nto alternate - if a leading cell takes the shorter (steeper gradient) path, the\ncell following it chooses the longer (weaker gradient) path, and vice versa.\nAdditionally, we found that when a mother cell divides, its two daughters go in\nopposite directions (even if it means migrating against the chemoattractant\ngradient and overcoming on-going cell traffic). Therefore, it is apparent that\nfibroblasts modify each other's directional decisions in a manner that is\ncounter-intuitive to what is expected from classical chemotaxis theory.\nConsequently, accounting for these effects could lead to a better understanding\nof tissue generation in vivo, and result in more advanced engineered tissue\nproducts in vitro.\n",

While real wounds have different shapes, standard wound healing assays\noften deal with just one simple wound shape, and it is unclear whether varying\nthe wound shape might impact how we interpret results from these experiments.\nIn this work, we describe a new kind of wound healing assay, called a sticker\nassay, that allows us to examine the role of wound shape in a series of wound\nhealing assays performed with fibroblast cells. In particular, we show how to\nuse the sticker assay to examine wound healing with square, circular and\ntriangular shaped wounds. We take a standard approach and report measurements\nof the size of the wound as a function of time. This shows that the rate of\nwound closure depends on the initial wound shape. This result is interesting\nbecause the only aspect of the assay that we change is the initial wound shape,\nand the reason for the different rate of wound closure is unclear. To provide\nmore insight into the experimental observations we describe our results\nquantitatively by calibrating a mathematical model, describing the relevant\ntransport phenomena, to match our experimental data. Overall, our results\nsuggest that the rates of cell motility and cell proliferation from different\ninitial wound shapes are approximately the same, implying that the differences\nwe observe in the wound closure rate are consistent with a fairly typical\nmathematical model of wound healing. Our results imply that parameter estimates\nobtained from an experiment performed with one particular wound shape could be\nused to describe an experiment performed with a different shape.

Extracellular\nmatrix concentration, cell density, proliferation, cell viability, topology and\nultrastructure parameters were determined. The results showed that for both\ncell lines, the best conditioning regimen for compact and homogeneous spheroid\nformation was to use 1000 cells per well and 2% Geltrex. This conditioning\nregimen highlighted two 3D cell models: non-proliferative SUM1315 spheroids and\nproliferative MDA-MB-231 spheroids. In both cell lines, the comparison of 2D vs\n3D cell culture viability in the presence of increasing concentrations of\nchemotherapeutic agents i.e. cisplatin, docetaxel and epirubicin, showed that\nspheroids were clearly less sensitive than monolayer cell cultures. Moreover, a\nproliferative or non-proliferative 3D cell line property would enable\ndetermination of cytotoxic and/or cytostatic drug activity. 3D cell culture\ncould be an excellent tool in addition to the arsenal of techniques currently\nused in preclinical studies. http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/\nOncotarget, Advance Publications 2017\n",

In\nthis study, we quantify the variability of the cross-reactivity by using a\nstring model that estimates the binding affinity between two sequences of amino\nacids. We examine sequences of 10,000 human T-cell receptors and 10,000\nantigenic peptides, and obtain a full spectrum of cross-reactivity of the\nreceptor-peptide binding. Then, we find that the cross-reactivity spectrum is\nbroad. Some T cells are reactive to 1,000 peptides, but some T cells are\nreactive to only one or two peptides. Since the degree of cross-reactivity has\na correlation with the (un)binding affinity of receptors, we further\ninvestigate how the broad crossreactivity affects the target searching of T\ncells. High cross-reactive T cells may not require many trials for searching\ncorrect targets, but they may spend long time to unbind from incorrect targets.\nIn contrast, low cross-reactive T cells may not spend long time to ignore\nincorrect targets, but they require many trials for screening correct targets.\nWe evaluate this hypothesis, and show that the broad cross-reactivity of the\nnatural T-cell repertoire can balance the trade-off between the rapid screening\nand unbinding penalty.\n",

Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of livers from\nobese individuals, we found that both hypomethylation at a CpG site in PDGFA\n(encoding platelet derived growth factor alpha) and PDGFA overexpression are\nassociated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin\nresistance and increased steatohepatitis risk. Both genetic risk score studies\nand human cell modeling pointed to a causative impact of high insulin levels on\nPDGFA CpG site hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA\nsecretion from liver. We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its\nown expression through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin\nresistance through decreased expression of both insulin receptor substrate 1\nand of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be\nrestored by PDGF-AA blocking antibodies, PDGF receptor inhibitors and by\nmetformin opening therapeutic avenues. Conclusion: Therefore, in the liver of\nobese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin\nresistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and NAFLD.\n",

        "summary": "  The metaphor of a potential epigenetic differentiation landscape broadly\nsuggests that during differentiation a stem cell follows the steepest\ndescending gradient toward a stable equilibrium state which represents the\nfinal cell type. It has been conjectured that there is an analogy to the\nconcept of entropy in statistical mechanics. In this context, in the\nundifferentiated state the entropy would be large since fewer constraints exist\non the gene expression programs of the cell. As differentiation progresses,\ngene expression programs become more and more constrained and thus the entropy\nwould be expected to decrease. Such an entropy decrease would, in analogy to\nstatistical mechanics, require some form of free energy to decrease\naccordingly. In order to assess these predictions, we compute the Shannon\nentropy for time-resolved single-cell gene expression data in two different\nexperimental setups of haematopoietic differentiation. We find that the\nbehaviour of this entropy measure is in contrast to these predictions. In\nparticular, we find that the Shannon entropy is not a decreasing function of\ndevelopmental pseudo-time but instead it increases toward the point of\ncommitment before decreasing again. This behaviour is consistent with an\nincrease in gene expression disorder observed in populations sampled at the\npoint of commitment. Single cells in these populations exhibit different\ncombinations of regulator activity that suggest the presence of multiple\nconfigurations of a potential differentiation network as a result of multiple\nentry points into the committed state.\n",

To understand why different forms of LL/lymphoma occur at\ndifferent ages, we analyzed the effects of different types of DNA changes on a\nLC and the cellular characteristics of LCs. Point DNA mutations (PDMs) and\nchromosome changes (CCs) are the two major types of DNA changes. CCs have three\nsubtypes by their effects on a LC: great-effect CCs (GECCs), mild-effect CCs\n(MECCs), and intermediate-effect CCs (IECCs). PDMs and MECCs are mostly mild\nthus can accumulate in cells. Some of the PDMs/MECCs contribute to cell\ntransformation. A GECC affects one or more genes and can alone drive cell\ntransformation. An IECC affects one or more genes and participates in cell\ntransformation. Due to cellular characteristics, a LC may have higher\nsurvivability from DNA changes and require obtaining fewer cancerous properties\nfor transformation than a tissue cell. Hence, a LC can be more rapidly\ntransformed by a CC. On this basis, we hypothesize that a LC may have three\npathways on transformation: a slow, a rapid, and an accelerated. Slow pathway\nis driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs. Rapid pathway is driven by a GECC in\n\"one step\". Accelerated pathway is driven by accumulation of\nPDMs/MECCs/IECC(s). Cell transformations of a LC via different pathways occur\nat different ages. A transformation via slow pathway occurs mainly in adults. A\ntransformation via rapid pathway occurs at any age and has no increasing\nincidence with age. A transformation via accelerated pathway occurs also at any\nage but has increasing incidence with age. In conclusion, a LC may have three\npathways on cell transformation, and the occurring age of LL/lymphoma may be\ndetermined by the transforming pathway of a LC.\n",

        "summary": "  Piscine orthoreovirus Strain PRV-1 is the causative agent of heart and\nskeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Given its\nhigh prevalence in net pen salmon, debate has arisen on whether PRV poses a\nrisk to migratory salmon, especially in British Columbia (BC) where\ncommercially important wild Pacific salmon are in decline. Various strains of\nPRV have been associated with diseases in Pacific salmon, including\nerythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS), HSMI-like disease, and\njaundice/anemia in Japan, Norway, Chile and Canada. We examine the\ndevelopmental pathway of HSMI and jaundice/anemia associated with PRV-1 in\nfarmed Atlantic and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon in BC,\nrespectively. In situ hybridization localized PRV-1 within developing lesions\nin both diseases. The two diseases showed dissimilar pathological pathways,\nwith inflammatory lesions in heart and skeletal muscle in Atlantic salmon, and\ndegenerative-necrotic lesions in kidney and liver in Chinook salmon, plausibly\nexplained by differences in PRV load tolerance in red blood cells. Viral genome\nsequencing revealed no consistent differences in PRV-1 variants intimately\ninvolved in the development of both diseases, suggesting that migratory Chinook\nsalmon may be at more than a minimal risk of disease from exposure to the high\nlevels of PRV occurring on salmon farms.\n",

PDAC includes an anisotropic\nfibrous-like stroma, desmoplasia, encompassing most of the tumor mass.\nDesmoplasia is produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts, CAFs, and their\ncell-derived extracellular matrices, CDMs. Since elimination of CAFs is\ndetrimental to patients, CDM reprogramming, as opposed to desmoplasia ablation,\nis therapeutically desirable.

Of particular interest are homeostasis mechanisms, which\nbuffer growth and division from accumulating fluctuations over multiple cycles.\nThese mechanisms operate within single cells, possibly extending over several\ndivision cycles. However, all experimental studies to date have relied on\nmeasurements pooled from many distinct cells. Here, we disentangle long-term\nmeasured traces of individual cells from one another, revealing subtle\ndifferences between temporal and pooled statistics. By analyzing correlations\nalong up to hundreds of generations, we find that the parameter describing\neffective cell-size homeostasis strength varies significantly among cells. At\nthe same time, we find an invariant cell size which acts as an attractor to all\nindividual traces, albeit with different effective attractive forces. Despite\nthe common attractor, each cell maintains a distinct average size over its\nfinite lifetime with suppressed temporal fluctuations around it, and\nequilibration to the global average size is surprisingly slow (> 150 cell\ncycles). To demonstrate a possible source of variable homeostasis strength, we\nconstruct a mathematical model relying on intracellular interactions, which\nintegrates measured properties of cell size with those of highly expressed\nproteins. Effective homeostasis strength is then influenced by interactions and\nby noise levels, and generally varies among cells. A predictable and measurable\nconsequence of variable homeostasis strength appears as distinct oscillatory\npatterns in cell size and protein content over many generations. We discuss the\nimplications of our results to understanding mechanisms controlling division in\nsingle cells and their characteristic timescales\n",

Discrete agents named capillary\nelements and modelling groups of endothelial cells are created or deleted\naccording to different rules involving the oxygen concentration gradient, the\nblood velocity, the sheer stress or the capillary element density. Once\ncreated, a capillary element locally enhances the hydraulic conductivity\nmatrix, contributing to a local increase of the blood velocity and oxygen flow.\nNo connectivity between the capillary elements is imposed. The coupling between\nblood, oxygen flow and capillary elements provides a positive feedback\nmechanism which triggers the emergence of a network of channels of high\nhydraulic conductivity which we identify as new blood capillaries.

Multiple parameters associated with activation\nconditions are involved in generating this diversity that is associated with\nheterogeneous molecular contents of activated cells. Although naive cell\npolarisation upon antigenic stimulation and the resulting asymmetric division\nare known to be a major source of heterogeneity and cell fate regulation, the\nconsequences of stochastic uneven partitioning of molecular content upon\nsubsequent divisions remain unclear yet. Here we aim at studying the impact of\nuneven partitioning on molecular-content heterogeneity and then on the immune\nresponse dynamics at the cellular level. To do so, we introduce a multiscale\nmathematical model of the CD8 T-cell immune response in the lymph node. In the\nmodel, cells are described as agents evolving and interacting in a 2D\nenvironment while a set of differential equations, embedded in each cell,\nmodels the regulation of intra and extracellular proteins involved in cell\ndifferentiation. Based on the analysis of in silico data at the single cell\nlevel, we 1 show that immune response dynamics can be explained by the\nmolecular-content heterogeneity generated by uneven partitioning at cell\ndivision. In particular, uneven partitioning acts as a regulator of cell\ndifferentiation and induces the emergence of two coexisting sub-populations of\ncells exhibiting antagonistic fates. We show that the degree of unevenness of\nmolecular partitioning, along all cell divisions, affects the outcome of the\nimmune response and can promote the generation of memory cells.\n",

In\nparticular, while CTLs in the pre-activation state move in a non-local search\npattern, the search pattern of activated CTLs is more localised. In this paper,\nwe develop a kinetic model for such a switch in CTL migration modes. The model\nis formulated as a coupled system of balance equations for the one-particle\ndistribution functions of CTLs in the pre-activation state, activated CTLs and\nDCs. CTL activation is modelled via binary interactions between CTLs in the\npre-activation state and DCs. Moreover, cell motion is represented as a\nvelocity-jump process, with the running time of CTLs in the pre-activation\nstate following a long-tailed distribution, which is consistent with a L\\'evy\nwalk, and the running time of activated CTLs following a Poisson distribution,\nwhich corresponds to Brownian motion. We formally show that the macroscopic\nlimit of the model comprises a coupled system of balance equations for the cell\ndensities whereby activated CTL movement is described via a classical diffusion\nterm, whilst a fractional diffusion term describes the movement of CTLs in the\npre-activation state.

A band of life vital individual pulses was\nobtained in a single run of the experiment, which not only allowed the\nfundamental frequencies (and intensities of the processes) to be determined but\nalso permitted the phase relations of the various transport processes in the\nplasma membrane and tonoplast to be established. A discrete frequency spectrum\n(like the hydrogen spectrum in quantum physics) was achieved for a growing\nplant for the first time, while all of the metabolic and enzymatic functions of\nthe life cell cycle were preserved using this totally non-invasive treatment.\n",

As a means to investigate collective migration, we consider a wound\nhealing scenario in which a population of cells fills in the empty space left\nfrom a scratch wound. Here we present a simplified mathematical model that uses\nreaction-diffusion equations to model collective migration during wound healing\nwith an emphasis on cell movement and its response to both cell signaling and\ncell-cell adhesion. We use the model to investigate the effect of the MAPK\nsignaling cascade on cell-cell adhesion during wound healing after EGF\ntreatment. Our results suggest that activation of the MAPK signaling cascade\nstimulates collective migration through increases in the pulling strength of\nleader cells. We further use the model to suggest that treating a cell\npopulation with EGF converts the time to wound closure (as function of wound\narea) from parabolic to linear.\n",

The infected cell life\ncycle consists of a non-productively infected stage in which it is producing\nvirions but not releasing them and of a productively infected stage in which it\nis just releasing virions. The study explores why the infected cell cycle\nshould be so delineated, something which is akin to a classic bang-bang control\nor all-or-none principle. The times spent in each of these stages represent a\nviral strategy to optimize peak viral load. Increasing the time spent in the\nnon-productively infected phase ({\\tau}1) would lead to a concomitant increase\nin peak viremia. However increasing this time would also invite a more vigorous\nresponse from Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs). Simultaneously, if there is a\nvigorous antibody response, then we might expect {\\tau}1 to be high, in order\nthat the virus builds up its population and conversely if there is a weak\nantibody response, {\\tau}1 might be small. These tradeoffs are explored using a\nmathematical model of virus propagation using Ordinary Differential Equations\n(ODEs). The study raises questions about whether common viruses have actually\nsettled into an optimum, the role for reliability and whether experimental\ninfections of hosts with non-endemic strains could help elicit answers about\nviral progression.\n",

In Dicty, signal detection and\ntransduction involves a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) through which\nextracellular cAMP signals are transduced into Ras activation via an\nintermediate heterotrimeric G-protein (G2). Ras activation is the first\npolarized response to cAMP gradients in Dicty. Recent work has revealed mutiple\nnew characteristics of Ras activation in Dicty, thereby providing new insights\ninto direction sensing mechanisms and pointing to the need for new models of\nchemotaxis. Here we propose a novel reaction-diffusion model of Ras activation\nbased on three major components: one involving the GPCR, one centered on G2,\nand one involving the monomeric G protein Ras. In contrast to existing local\nexcitation, global inhibition (LEGI) models of direction sensing, in which a\nfast-responding but slowly-diffusing activator and a slow-acting rapidly\ndiffusing inhibitor set up an internal gradient of activity, our model is based\non equal diffusion coefficients for all cytosolic species, and the unbalanced\nlocal sequestration of some species leads to gradient sensing and\namplification. We show that Ric8-modulated G2 cycling between the cytosol and\nmembrane can account for many of the observed responses in Dicty. including\nimperfect adaptation, multiple phases of Ras activity in a cAMP gradient,\nrectified directional sensing, and cellular memory.\n",

This law says that the average cell volume scales\nexponentially with growth rate, with a scaling exponent equal to the time from\ninitiation of a round of DNA replication to the cell division at which the\ncorresponding sister chromosomes segregate. Here, we sought to test the\nrobustness of the growth law to systematic perturbations in cell dimensions\nachieved by varying the expression levels of mreB and ftsZ. We found that\ndecreasing the mreB level resulted in increased cell width, with little change\nin cell length, whereas decreasing the ftsZ level resulted in increased cell\nlength. Furthermore, the time from replication termination to cell division\nincreased with the perturbed dimension in both cases. Moreover, the growth law\nremained valid over a range of growth conditions and dimension perturbations.\nThe growth law can be quantitatively interpreted as a consequence of a tight\ncoupling of cell division to replication initiation. Thus, its robustness to\nperturbations in cell dimensions strongly supports models in which the timing\nof replication initiation governs that of cell division, and cell volume is the\nkey phenomenological variable governing the timing of replication initiation.\nThese conclusions are discussed in the context of our recently proposed\nadder-per-origin model, in which cells add a constant volume per origin between\ninitiations and divide a constant time after initiation.\n",

In contrast, the identification of stereotypes in single cells\nposes a significant challenge as the cell lacks these landmark features, and\nfinding constraints on cell shape is a non-trivial task. Here, we use the\nmaximum caliber variational method to build a minimal model of cell behavior\nduring migration. Without reference to biochemical details, we are able to make\nbehavioral predictions over timescales of minutes using only changes in cell\nshape over timescales of seconds. We use drug treatment and genetics to\ndemonstrate that maximum caliber descriptors can discriminate between healthy\nand aberrant migration, thereby showing potential applications for maximum\ncaliber methods in automated disease screening, for example in the\nidentification of behaviors associated with cancer metastasis.\n",

There are typically two\napproaches to modelling cell migration: either micro-scale, discrete or\nmacro-scale, continuum. The discrete approach, using agent-based models (ABMs),\nis typically stochastic and accounts for properties at the cell-scale.\nConversely, the continuum approach, in which cell density is often modelled as\na system of deterministic partial differential equations (PDEs), provides a\nglobal description of the migration at the population level. Deterministic\nmodels have the advantage that they are generally more amenable to mathematical\nanalysis. They can lead to significant insights for situations in which the\nsystem comprises a large number of cells, at which point simulating a\nstochastic ABM becomes computationally expensive. However, finding an\nappropriate continuum model to describe the collective behaviour of a system of\nindividual cells can be a difficult task. Deterministic models are often\nspecified on a phenomenological basis, which reduces their predictive power.\nStochastic ABMs have advantages over their deterministic continuum\ncounterparts. In particular, ABMs can represent individual-level behaviours\n(such as cell proliferation and cell-cell interaction) appropriately and are\namenable to direct parameterisation using experimental data. It is essential,\ntherefore, to establish direct connections between stochastic micro-scale\nbehaviours and deterministic macro-scale dynamics.

By using sequential cell transfers and B cell populations from several\nmutant mice, we were able to identify novel mechanisms regulating the size of\nthe IgM-secreting B cell pool. Contrary to previous mechanisms described\nregulating homeostasis, which involve competition for the same niche by cells\nhaving overlapping survival requirements, homeostasis of the innate\nIgM-secreting B cell pool is also achieved when B cells populations are able to\nmonitor the number of activated B cells by detecting their secreted products.\nNotably, B cell populations are able to assess the density of activated B cells\nby sensing their secreted IgG. This process involves the Fc{\\gamma}RIIB, a\nlow-affinity IgG receptor that is expressed on B cells and acts as a negative\nregulator of B cell activation, and its intracellular effector the inositol\nphosphatase SHIP. As a result of the engagement of this inhibitory pathway the\nnumber of activated IgM-secreting B cells is kept under control.

These oscillations emerge once the\ncolony reaches a large enough number of cells. However, it remains unclear\nwhether the amplitude of the oscillations, and thus their effectiveness, builds\nup over time gradually, or if they can emerge instantly with a non-zero\namplitude. Here we address this question by combining microfluidics-based\ntime-lapse microscopy experiments with a minimal theoretical description of the\nsystem in the form of a delay-differential equation model. Analytical and\nnumerical methods reveal that oscillations arise through a subcritical Hopf\nbifurcation, which enables instant high amplitude oscillations. Consequently,\nthe model predicts a bistable regime where an oscillating and a non-oscillating\nattractor coexist in phase space. We experimentally validate this prediction by\nshowing that oscillations can be triggered by perturbing the media conditions,\nprovided the biofilm size lies within an appropriate range. The model also\npredicts that the minimum size at which oscillations start decreases with\nstress, a fact that we also verify experimentally. Taken together, our results\nshow that collective oscillations in cell populations can emerge suddenly with\nnon-zero amplitude via a discontinuous transition.\n",

Mechanisms underlying nerve damage and sensory loss following\nmetabolic dysfunction remain large unclear. Recently, hyperglycemia-induced\nmitochondrial dysfunction and the generation of ROS have gained attention as\npossible mechanisms of organ damage in diabetes. Hypoxia-inducible factor\n1(HIF1a) is a key transcription factor activated by hypoxia, hyperglycemia,\nnitric oxide as well as ROS, suggesting a fundamental role in DPN\nsusceptibility. Genetically-modified mutant mice, which conditionally lack\nHIF1a in peripheral sensory neurons (SNS-HIF1a-/-), were analyzed\nlongitudinally up to 6 months in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type1\ndiabetes. Behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical\nstimuli, quantitative morphological analyses of intraepidermal nerve fiber\ndensity and measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sensory neurons in\nvivo were undertaken over several months post-STZ injections to delineate the\nrole of HIF1a in DPN. Longitudinal behavioral and morphological analyses at 5,\n13 and 24 wks post-STZ treatment revealed that SNS-HIF1a-/- developed stronger\nhyperglycemia-evoked losses of peripheral nociceptive sensory axons associated\nwith stronger losses of mechano- and heat sensation with a faster onset than\nHIF1afl/fl mice. Mechanistically, these histomorphologic and behavioral\ndifferences were associated with significantly higher level of STZ-induced\nproduction of ROS in sensory neurons of SNS-HIF1a-/- mice as compared with\nHIF1afl/fl. Our results indicate that HIF1a is as an upstream modulator of ROS\nin peripheral sensory neurons and exerts a protective function in suppressing\nhyperglycemia-induced nerve damage by limiting ROS levels. HIF1a stabilization\nmay be thus a new strategy target for limiting sensory loss, a debilitating\nlate complication of diabetes.\n",

Although computational and\ntheoretical analyses could elucidate these phenomena, such methods have rarely\nbeen used in realistic (large-dimensional) gap-junction coupled heterogeneous\npacemaker tissue models. In this study, we adapt a recent model of pacemaker\ncells (Severi et al. 2012), incorporating biophysical representations of ion\nchannel and intracellular calcium dynamics, to capture physiological features\nof a heterogeneous population of pacemaker cells, in particular \"center\" and\n\"peripheral\" cells with distinct intrinsic frequencies and action potential\nmorphology. Large-scale simulations of the SAN tissue, represented by a\nheterogeneous tissue structure of pacemaker cells, exhibit a rich repertoire of\nbehaviors, including complete synchrony, traveling waves of activity\noriginating from periphery to center, and transient traveling waves originating\nfrom the center. We use phase reduction methods that do not require fully\nsimulating the large-scale model to capture these observations. Moreover, the\nphase reduced models accurately predict key properties of the tissue electrical\ndynamics, including wave frequencies when synchronization occurs, and wave\npropagation direction in a variety of tissue models. With the reduced phase\nmodels, we analyze the relationship between cell distributions and coupling\nstrengths and the resulting transient dynamics. Further, the reduced phase\nmodel predicts parameter regimes of irregular electrical dynamics. Thus, we\ndemonstrate that phase reduced oscillator models applied to realistic pacemaker\ntissue is a useful tool for investigating the spatial-temporal dynamics of\ncardiac pacemaker activity.\n",

In these crowded environments cells are able to interact with each\nother in a variety of ways. These include excluded volume interactions,\nadhesion, repulsion, cell signalling, pushing and pulling. One popular way to\nunderstand the behaviour of a group of interacting cells is through an\nagent-based model (ABM). A typical aim of modellers using such represtations is\nto elucidate how the microscopic interactions at the cell-level impact on the\nmacroscopic behaviour of the population. The complex cell-cell interactions\nlisted above have also been incorporated into such models; all apart from\ncell-cell pulling. In this paper we consider this under-represented cell-cell\ninteraction, in which an active cell is able to `pull' a nearby neighbour as it\nmoves. We incorporate a variety of potential cell-cell pulling mechanisms into\non- and off-lattice agent-based volume exclusion models of cell movement. For\neach of these agent-based models we derive a continuum partial differential\nequation which describes the evolution of the cells at a population-level. We\nstudy the agreement between the ABMs and the continuum, population-based\nmodels, and compare and contrast a range of ABMs (accounting for the different\npulling mechanisms) with each other. We find generally good agreement between\nthe ABMs and the corresponding continuum models that worsens as the agent-based\nmodels become more complex. Interestingly, we observe that the partial\ndifferential equations that we derive differ significantly, depending on\nwhether they were derived from on- or off-lattice ABMs of pulling.

Since unsuccessful protection could be\nrelated to suppressed T cell responses, we analyzed the expression of\ninhibitory receptor PD-1 in CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes and it is ligand PD-L2 in\nmacrophages of BALB/c mice immunized with various doses of Leishmania mexicana\nLPG and re-stimulated in vitro with different concentrations of LPG.\nVaccination with LPG enhanced the expression of PD-1 in CD8+ cells. Activation\nmolecules CD137 were reduced in CD8+ cells from vaccinated mice. In vitro\nre-stimulation enhanced PD-L2 expression in macrophages of healthy mice in a\ndose-dependent fashion. The expression of PD-1, PD-L2, and CD137 is modulated\naccording to the amount of LPG used during immunization and in vitro\nre-stimulation. We analyzed the expression of these molecules in mice infected\nwith 1 x 10'4 or 1 x 10'5 L. mexicana promastigotes and re-stimulated in vitro\nwith LPG. Infection with 1 x 10'5 parasites increased the PD-1 expression in\nCD8+ and diminished PD-L2 in macrophages. When these CD8+ cells were\nre-stimulated in vitro with LPG, simulating a second exposure to parasite\nantigens, PD-1 expression increased significantly more, in a dose-dependent\nfashion. We conclude that CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages express inhibition\nmolecules according to the concentrations of Leishmania LPG and to the parasite\nload. Vaccination with increased amounts of LPG or infections with higher\nparasite numbers induces enhanced expression of PD-1 and functional\ninactivation of CD8+ cells, which can have critical consequences in\nleishmaniasis since these cells are crucial for disease control.\n",

        "summary": "  Atherosclerosis is characterised by the growth of fatty plaques in the inner\n(intimal) layer of the artery wall. In mature plaques, vascular smooth muscle\ncells (SMCs) are recruited from the adjacent medial layer to deposit a cap of\nfibrous collagen over the fatty plaque core. The fibrous cap isolates the\nthrombogenic content of the plaque from the bloodstream and prevents the\nformation of blood clots that cause myocardial infarction or stroke. Despite\nthe important protective role of the cap, the mechanisms that regulate cap\nformation and maintenance are not well understood. It remains unclear why\ncertain caps become stable, while others become vulnerable to rupture. We\ndevelop a multiphase PDE model with non-standard boundary conditions to\ninvestigate collagen cap formation by SMCs in response to growth factor signals\nfrom the endothelium. Diffusible platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)\nstimulates SMC migration, proliferation and collagen degradation, while\ndiffusible transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\\beta$ stimulates SMC collagen\nsynthesis and inhibits collagen degradation. The model SMCs respond\nhaptotactically to gradients in the collagen phase and have reduced rates of\nmigration and proliferation in dense collagenous tissue. The model, which is\nparameterised using a range of in vivo and in vitro experimental data,\nreproduces several observations from studies of plaque growth in\natherosclerosis-prone mice. Numerical simulations and model analysis\ndemonstrate that a stable cap can be formed by a relatively small SMC\npopulation and emphasise the critical role of TGF-$\\beta$ in effective cap\nformation and maintenance. These findings provide unique insight into the\ncellular and biochemical mechanisms that may lead to plaque destabilisation and\nrupture. This work represents an important step towards the development of a\ncomprehensive in silico plaque.\n",

During the last\ndecade data accumulated to show that monocytes and macrophages, the two main\ninitiators of innate immune response, also built up a \"memory\" to antigens they\nencountered, though in most concerned publications a different wording (i.e.\n\"train\" or\"educate\") was utilized to describe this feature. More recently, Hole\net al demonstrated a \"memory-like\" response of dendritic cells (DCs). In brief,\nif fungal-challenged mice could develop a protective immune response, DCs\nimmediately (in 3 weeks) isolated from those mice would manifest a\npro-inflammatory phenotype. Even after the mice were allowed to rest for 10\nweeks, DCs from them still exhibited an enhanced immune activation profile in\ntheir transcriptome and cytokine productions upon re-challenge with same\npathogens. Lastly, Hole showed that the \"training\" or memory-building in DCs\nwas achieved by histone modification. All above findings obtained in monocytes,\nmacrophages or DCs emphasized the necessity for rechecking the questions\nwhether antigen presenting cells (APCs) as a whole could be classified the\nthird class of cells that would mediate immunological memory. In this essay,\nthe author described the effort he made in late 1990s to identify dendtitic\ncell-mediated memory, and how he named his daughter SHUYI to memorize that\nhypothesis.\n",

In this paper, we propose a general\nmathematical model framework for the evolutionary dynamics of cancer with\nplasticity and heterogeneity in cancer cells. Cancer is a group of diseases\ninvolving abnormal cell growth, during which abnormal regulations in stem cell\nregeneration are essential for the dynamics of cancer development. In general,\nthe dynamics of stem cell regeneration can be simplified as a $\\mathrm{G_0}$\nphase cell cycle model, which lead to a delay differentiation equation. When\ncell heterogeneity and plasticity are considered, we establish a\ndifferential-integral equation based on the random transition of epigenetic\nstates of stem cells during cell division. The proposed model highlights cell\nheterogeneity and plasticity, and connects the heterogeneity with cell-to-cell\nvariance in cellular behaviors, e.g. proliferation, apoptosis, and\ndifferentiation/senescence, and can be extended to include gene\nmutation-induced tumor development. Hybrid computations models are developed\nbased on the mathematical model framework, and are applied to the process of\ninflammation-induced tumorigenesis and tumor relapse after CAR-T therapy.\nFinally, we give rise to several mathematical problems related to the proposed\ndifferential-integral equation. Answers to these problems are crucial for the\nunderstanding of the evolutionary dynamics of cancer.\n",

For strong adhesion to flat substrates, two-dimensional\ncontractile network models can be used to understand how force is distributed\nthroughout the cell. Here we compare the shape and force distribution for\ndifferent variants of such network models. In contrast to Hookean networks,\ncable networks reflect the asymmetric response of biopolymers to tension versus\ncompression. For passive networks, contractility is modeled by a reduced\nresting length of the mechanical links. In actively contracting networks, a\nconstant force couple is introduced into each link in order to model\ncontraction by molecular motors. If combined with fixed adhesion sites, all\nnetwork models lead to invaginated cell shapes, but only actively contracting\ncable networks lead to the circular arc morphology typical for strongly\nadhering cells. In this case, shape and force distribution are determined by\nlocal rather than global determinants and thus are suited to endow the cell\nwith a robust sense of its environment.

After division is completed and\nthe dividing septum is thinned, the mother cell engulfs the forespore in a slow\nprocess based on cell-wall degradation and synthesis. However, recently a new\ncell-wall independent mechanism was shown to significantly contribute, which\ncan even lead to fast engulfment in $\\sim$ 60 $%$ of the cases when the cell\nwall is completely removed. In this backup mechanism, strong ligand-receptor\nbinding between mother-cell protein SpoIIIAH and forespore-protein SpoIIQ leads\nto zipper-like engulfment, but quantitative understanding is missing. In our\nwork, we combined fluorescence image analysis and stochastic Langevin\nsimulations of the fluctuating membrane to investigate the origin of fast\nbistable engulfment in absence of the cell wall. Our cell morphologies compare\nfavorably with experimental time-lapse microscopy, with engulfment sensitive to\nthe number of SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH bonds in a threshold-like manner. By systematic\nexploration of model parameters, we predict regions of osmotic pressure and\nmembrane-surface tension that produce successful engulfment. Indeed, decreasing\nthe medium osmolarity in experiments prevents engulfment in line with our\npredictions. Forespore engulfment may thus not only be an ideal model system to\nstudy decision-making in single cells, but its biophysical principles are\nlikely applicable to engulfment in other cell types, e.g. during phagocytosis\nin eukaryotes.\n",

While temperature, population density and growth rate have all been\nshown to affect E. coli cell size distributions, and recent models have\nvalidated a link between growth rate and cell size through DNA replication,\ncell size variability is thought to emerge from growth rate variability. A\nmechanistic link that could distinguish the source of stochasticity, could\nimprove our understanding of cell size regulation. Here, we have developed a\npopulation dynamics model of individual cell division based on the BCD, birth,\nchromosome replication and division model, with DNA replication based on the\nCooper and Helmstetter (CH) multi-fork replication. In our model, stochasticity\nin the model arises solely from the dynamics of DNA replication forks. We model\nthe forks as two-state systems: stalled and recovered. Our model predicts an\nincrease in cell size variability with growth rate, consistent with previous\nexperimental reports. We perturb the model to test the effect of increased\nreplication fork (RF) stalling frequency, or uncoupling RF stalling from the\ncell-division machinery. Indeed, despite ignoring DNA and protein segregation\nasymmetry, the model can faithfully reproduce quantitative changes in cell size\ndistributions.

Quantitative\nexperiments have revealed two characteristic input-output relations of the\nsystem: First, in a static chemoattractant gradient, the shapes of the\nintracellular gradients of the signaling molecules are determined by the\nrelative steepness, rather than the absolute concentration, of the\nchemoattractant gradient along the cell body. Second, upon a spatially\nhomogeneous temporal increase in the input stimulus, the intracellular\nsignaling molecules are transiently activated such that the response magnitudes\nare dependent on fold changes of the stimulus, not on absolute levels. However,\nthe underlying mechanism that endows the system with these response properties\nremains elusive. Here, by adopting a widely used modeling framework of\ndirectional sensing, local excitation and global inhibition (LEGI), we propose\na hypothesis that the two rescaling behaviors stem from a single design\nprinciple, namely, invariance of the governing equations to a scale\ntransformation of the input level. Analyses of the LEGI-based model reveal that\nthe invariance can be divided into two parts, each of which is responsible for\nthe respective response properties. Our hypothesis leads to an experimentally\ntestable prediction that a system with the invariance detects relative\nsteepness even in dynamic gradient stimuli as well as in static gradients.\nFurthermore, we show that the relation between the response properties and the\nscale invariance is general in that it can be implemented by models with\ndifferent network topologies.\n",

To generate the oscillation, the hydrolysis of ATP is\nalways needed. Many recent studies show that both ATP molecules themselves and\nthe free energy by ATP hydrolysis play significant role in the biochemical\nprocess involving ATP hydrolysis. To verify the prediction, we consider the\nrole of ATP molecules and their hydrolysis in a classic one-pool model of Ca2+\noscillation. Our results show that the available Gibbs free energy of ATP\nhydrolysis {\\DeltaG}, which measures the \"distance\" of a reaction to its\nequilibrium state, is another important regulatory factor of the oscillation\nsystem besides the concentration of ATP. Furthermore, our model suggest a\nrudimental prediction of how the oscillation system changes in an aging cell,\nsuch as the decrease of the amplitude and the increase of the least {\\DeltaG}\nrequired for the oscillation.\n",

Self-organized complex systems are hypothesized\nto be a primary factor of the origin of life and to dominate heritability,\nmediating the partitioning of an equal distribution of structures and molecules\nat cell division. The degree of strength of self-organization would correlate\nwith heritability; self-organization is known to be a physical basis of\nhysteresis phenomena, and the degree of hysteresis is quantifiable. However,\nthere is no argument corroborating the relationship between heritability and\nhysteresis.

Here, we\npropose a novel deep reinforcement learning model for collective neural crest\ncell migration. We apply the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm in\nassociation with a particle dynamics simulation environment to train agents to\ndetermine the migration path. Because of the different migration mechanisms of\nleader and follower neural crest cells, we train two types of agents (leaders\nand followers) to learn the collective cell migration behavior. For a leader\nagent, we consider a linear combination of a global task, resulting in the\nshortest path to the target source, and a local task, resulting in a\ncoordinated motion along the local chemoattractant gradient. For a follower\nagent, we consider only the local task. First, we show that the self-driven\nforces learned by the leader cell point approximately to the placode, which\nmeans that the agent is able to learn to follow the shortest path to the\ntarget. To validate our method, we compare the total time elapsed for agents to\nreach the placode computed using the proposed method and the time computed\nusing an agent-based model. The distributions of the migration time intervals\ncalculated using the two methods are shown to not differ significantly. We then\nstudy the effect of co-attraction and contact-inhibition of locomotion to the\ncollective leader cell migration. We show that the overall leader cell\nmigration for the case with co-attraction is slower because the co-attraction\nmitigates the source-driven effect. In addition, we find that the leader and\nfollower agents learn to follow a similar migration behavior as in experimental\nobservations. Overall, our proposed method provides useful insight on how to\napply reinforcement learning techniques to simulate collective cell migration.\n",

        "summary": "  Neural inflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke. During\nthis process, microglial cells can be activated into two different phenotypes:\nthe M1 phenotype, which can worsen brain injury by producing pro-inflammatory\ncytokines; or the M2 phenotype, which can aid in long term recovery by\nproducing anti-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we formulate a nonlinear\nsystem of differential equations to model the activation of microglia\npost-ischemic stroke, which includes bidirectional switching between the\nmicroglia phenotypes, as well as the interactions between these cells and the\ncytokines that they produce. Further, we explore neuroprotectant-based modeling\nstrategies to suppress the activation of the detrimental M1 phenotype, while\npromoting activation of the beneficial M2 phenotype. Through use of global\nsensitivity techniques, we analyze the effects of the model parameters on the\nratio of M1 to M2 microglia and the total number of activated microglial cells\nin the system over time. Results demonstrate the significance of bidirectional\nmicroglia phenotype switching on the ratio of M1 to M2 microglia, in both the\nabsence and presence of neuroprotectant terms. Simulations further suggest that\nearly inhibition of M1 activation and support of M2 activation leads to a\ndecreased minimum ratio of M1 to M2 microglia and allows for a larger number of\nM2 than M1 cells for a longer time period.\n",

Despite the progress made in\n3D-printed orthopaedic implants, significant challenges remain in terms of\ncreating a material capable of osseointegration while inhibiting bacterial\ncolonisation of the implant. Diamond is rapidly emerging as a material with an\nextensive range of biomedical applications, especially due to its excellent\nbiocompatibility. However, diamond is a difficult material to fabricate, owing\nto its extreme level of hardness and its brittleness. New methods of\nfabrication including additive manufacturing, have overcome some of these\nchallenges and given rise to an increase in the use of diamond-based implants\nin both soft and hard tissue applications. Therefore, due to the unique\nproperties of diamond, it is being considered as a facilitator of bone growth\nand subsequent tissue integration. This review outlines the recent progress in\nfabricating diamond for orthopaedic application, specifically focusing on the\ndifferent fabrication approaches and their applicability in vitro and in vivo.\nThe prospects and challenges for using diamond in medical implant technologies\nare also discussed.\n",

In the contact zone the membrane inflects and\nforms an envelope around the virus. The created vesicle imports its cargo into\nthe cell.

The latter yields the upper limit for the size of virus\nwhich can be engulfed by the cell membrane.

Experimental findings in the past two decades have led to\nthe identification of a new mechanism of neovascularisation, cluster-based\nvasculogenesis, during which endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilised from\nthe bone marrow are capable of bridging distant vascular beds in a variety of\nhypoxic settings in vivo. This process is characterised by the formation of EPC\nclusters during its early stages and, while much progress has been made in\nidentifying various mechanisms underlying cluster formation, we are still far\nfrom a comprehensive description of such spatio-temporal dynamics. In order to\nachieve this, we propose a novel mathematical model of the early stages of\ncluster-based vasculogenesis, comprising of a system of nonlocal partial\ndifferential equations including key mechanisms such as endogenous chemotaxis,\nmatrix degradation, cell proliferation and cell-to-cell adhesion. We conduct a\nlinear stability analysis on the system, solve the equations numerically,\nconduct a parametric analysis of the numerical solutions of the 1D problem to\ninvestigate the role of underlying dynamics on the speed of cluster formation\nand the size of clusters, and verify the key results of the parametric analysis\nwith simulations of the 2D problem.

Nevertheless, traditional approaches to studying cell sensing assume\nsignals are either uniform or monotonic, neglecting spatial structures of\nnatural environments. In this work, we show that spatial sensing and navigation\ncan be optimized by adapting the spatial organization of signaling pathways to\nthe spatial structure of the environment. By viewing cell surface receptors as\na sensor network, we develop an information theoretic framework for computing\nthe optimal spatial organization of a sensing system for a given spatial\nsignaling environment. Applying the framework to simulated environments, we\nfind that spatial receptor localization maximizes information acquisition in\nmany natural contexts, including tissue and soil. Receptor localization extends\nnaturally to produce a dynamic protocol for redistributing signaling receptors\nduring cell navigation and can be implemented in a cell using a feedback\nscheme. In a simulated tissue environment, dynamic receptor localization boosts\nnavigation efficiency by 30-fold.

        "summary": "  Intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) has a strong impact on the efficacy of the\nimmune response against solid tumours. The number of sub-populations of cancer\ncells expressing different antigens and the percentage of immunogenic cells\n(i.e. tumour cells that are effectively targeted by immune cells) in a tumour\nare both expressions of ITH. Here, we present a spatially explicit stochastic\nindividual-based model of the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and\nCD8+ T cells, which makes it possible to dissect out the specific impact of\nthese two expressions of ITH on anti-tumour immune response. The set-up of\nnumerical simulations of the model is defined so as to mimic scenarios\nconsidered in previous experimental studies. Moreover, the ability of the model\nto qualitatively reproduce experimental observations of successful and\nunsuccessful immune surveillance is demonstrated. First, the results of\nnumerical simulations of this model indicate that the presence of a larger\nnumber of sub-populations of tumour cells that express different antigens is\nassociated with a reduced ability of CD8+ T cells to mount an effective\nanti-tumour immune response. Second, the presence of a larger percentage of\ntumour cells that are not effectively targeted by CD8+ T cells may reduce the\neffectiveness of anti-tumour immunity. Ultimately, the mathematical model\npresented in this paper may provide a framework to help biologists and\nclinicians to better understand the mechanisms that are responsible for the\nemergence of different outcomes of immunotherapy.\n",

Since the involved\ncell interactions are complex and difficult to measure individually in\nexperiments, mathematical modelling plays an increasingly important role to\nunravel the mechanisms governing segregation. The analysis of these theoretical\nmodels focuses mainly on the asymptotic behavior at large times, in a steady\nregime and for large numbers of cells. Most famously, cell-segregation models\nbased on the minimization of the total surface energy, a mechanism also driving\nthe demixing of immiscible fluids, are known to exhibit asymptotically a\nparticular algebraic scaling behavior. However, it is not clear, whether the\nasymptotic regime of the numerical models is relevant at the spatio-temporal\nscales of actual biological processes and in-vitro experiments. By developing a\nmapping between cell-based models and experimental settings, we are able to\ndirectly compare previous experimental data to numerical simulations of cell\nsegregation quantitatively. We demonstrate that the experiments are reproduced\nby the transitory regime of the models rather than the asymptotic one. Our work\nputs a new perspective on previous model-driven conclusions on cell segregation\nmechanisms.\n",

Inspired by a recent\ntheoretical development that clustered mammalian cells respond differently to\nchemical gradients than single cells, we studied tumor spheroid invasion within\na 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) in the presence of EGF gradients. We found that\nEGF gradients promoted tumor cell detachment from the spheroid core, and the\nposition of the tumor spheroid core showed a mild chemotactic response towards\nthe EGF gradients. For those tumor cells detached from the spheroids, they\nshowed an enhanced chemokinesis response in contrast to previous experimental\nresults using single cells embedded within an ECM. No discernible chemotactic\nresponse towards the EGF gradients was found for the cells outside the spheroid\ncore.

However, undesirable SS is\ngenerated during physiological process such as collective cell migration (CCM)\nand influences the biological processes such as morphogenesis, wound healing\nand cancer invasion. Despite extensive research devoted to study the stress\ngeneration caused by CCM, we still do not fully understand the main cause of SS\ngeneration. An attempt is made here to offer some answers to these questions by\nconsidering the rearrangement of cell monolayers. The SS generation represents\na consequence of natural and forced convection. While forced convection is\ndependent on cell speed, the natural convection is induced by the gradient of\ntissue surface tension. The phenomenon is known as the Marangoni effect. The\ngradient of tissue surface tension induces directed cell spreading from the\nregions of lower tissue surface tension to the regions of higher tissue surface\ntension. This directed cell migration is described by the Marangoni flux. The\nphenomenon has been recognized during the rearrangement of (1) epithelial cell\nmonolayers and (2) mixed cell monolayers made by epithelial and mesenchymal\ncells. The consequence of the Marangoni effect is an intensive spreading of\ncancer cells through an epithelium. In this work, a review of existing\nliterature about SS generation caused by CCM is given along with the assortment\nof published experimental findings, in order to invite experimentalists to test\ngiven theoretical considerations in multicellular systems.\n",

At the multicellular\nlevel, this \"lateral inhibition\" principle leads to checkerboard patterns of\nSender and Receiver cells. While it is well known that stochasticity modulates\ncell fate specification, little is known about how stochastic fluctuations at\nthe cellular level propagate during multicell pattern formation. Here, we model\nstochastic fluctuations in the Notch-Delta pathway in the presence of two\ndifferent noise types - shot and white - for a multicell system. The results\nshow that intermediate fluctuations reduce disorder and guide the multicell\nlattice toward more checkerboard like patterns. By further analyzing cell fate\ntransition events, we demonstrate that intermediate noise amplitudes provide\nenough perturbation to facilitate \"proofreading\" of disordered patterns and\ncause cells to switch to their correct ordered state. Conversely, high noise\ncan override environmental signals coming from neighboring cells and lead to\nswitching between ordered and disordered patterns. Therefore, in analogy with\nspin glass systems, intermediate noise levels allow the multicell Notch system\nto escape frustrated patterns and relax towards the lower energy checkerboard\npattern while at large noise levels the system is unable to find this ordered\nbase of attraction.\n",

Plaque formation is orchestrated by macrophages that are\nrecruited to the artery wall to consume and remove blood-derived lipids, such\nas low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Ineffective lipid removal, due to macrophage\ndeath and other factors, leads to the accumulation of lipid-loaded macrophages\nand formation of a necrotic core. Experimental observations suggest that\nmacrophage functionality varies with the extent of lipid loading. However,\nlittle is known about the resultant influence on plaque fate. Extending work by\nFord et al. (2019) and Chambers et al.

The model, a system of partial-integro differential\nequations, considers several macrophage behaviours. These include: recruitment\nto the artery wall; proliferation and apoptosis; ingestion of LDL, apoptotic\ncells and necrotic lipid; emigration from the artery wall; and necrosis of\napoptotic cells. Here, we consider apoptosis, emigration and proliferation to\nbe lipid-dependent. We model lipid-dependence in these behaviours with\nexperimentally-informed functions of the internalised lipid load. Our results\ndemonstrate that lipid-dependent macrophage behaviour can substantially alter\nplaque fate by changing both the total quantity of lipid in the plaque and the\ndistribution of lipid between the live cells, dead cells and necrotic core.

However, the\nheterogeneity of burn wounds often complicates wound assessment, causing\ninaccurate wound evaluation and ineffective treatment. Traditional wound\nassessment methods such as Gross Area Reduction (GAR) and Percentage Area\nReduction (PAR) are prone to misinterpretation, due to irregular results.\nInaccurate wound assessment leads to higher rates of death and life-long\nphysical and psychological morbidities in burn patients, especially in\nlow-income communities that lack specialty care and medical resources.\nTherefore, I propose a novel approach to wound assessment: wound healing from\nthe biophysical perspective of collective cell migration by analyzing cell\npacking behavior. This approach was modeled through Voronoi Tessellation\nsimulations and applied to a wound healing system, where changes in the cell\nmorphology parameters of aspect ratio and shape index were plotted over time to\nnumerically evaluate the geometry of different cell migration packing patterns.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of measuring aspect ratio,\nas a reduction in aspect ratio indicates that cell shapes become increasingly\nrounded throughout wound closure.

By placing\na microscope objective on a phone camera, it is possible to directly examine\nany wound, with the calculations done on the phone as well. This efficient and\naccurate mechanism can be especially useful in low-resource communities, as it\nis accessible regardless of technical or medical background.\n",

Observations of the distribution of the\nextracellular matrix (ECM) component fibronectin during the migration of\nloosely connected neural crest cells (NCCs) lead us to hypothesize that NCC\nremodeling of an initially punctate ECM creates a scaffold for trailing cells,\nenabling them to form robust and coherent stream patterns. We evaluate this\nidea in a theoretical setting by developing an individual-based computational\nmodel that incorporates reciprocal interactions between NCCs and their ECM. ECM\nremodeling, haptotaxis, contact guidance, and cell-cell repulsion are\nsufficient for cells to establish streams in silico, however additional\nmechanisms, such as chemotaxis, are required to consistently guide cells along\nthe correct target corridor. Further model investigations imply that contact\nguidance and differential cell-cell repulsion between leader and follower cells\nare key contributors to robust collective cell migration by preventing stream\nbreakage. Global sensitivity analysis and simulated gain- and loss-of-function\nexperiments suggest that long-distance migration without jamming is most likely\nto occur when leading cells specialize in creating ECM fibers, and trailing\ncells specialize in responding to environmental cues by upregulating mechanisms\nsuch as contact guidance.\n",

Despite existing computational models of\namoeboid motion, the inference of expansion and retraction components of\nindividual cells, the corresponding classification of cells, and the a priori\nspecification of the parameter regime to achieve a specific motility behavior\nremain challenging open problems.

Mathematically,\nthese correspond to the intensity of a self-exciting Poisson point process, the\narea-preserving curve-shortening flow, and an area adjustment flow. The model\nis used to generate contour data for a variety of qualitatively different,\ne.g., polarized and non-polarized, cell tracks that are hardly distinguishable\nfrom experimental data. In application to experimental cell tracks, we inferred\nthe protrusion component and examined its correlation to commonly used\nbiomarkers: the actin concentration close to the membrane and its local motion.\nDue to the low model complexity, parameter estimation is fast, straightforward\nand offers a simple way to classify contour dynamics based on two locomotion\ntypes: the amoeboid and a so-called fan-shaped type.

Linear stability analysis identified the unstable\nparameter regimes where spontaneous symmetry breaking can take place. sing\nsimulations to solve the fully coupled nonlinear system of equations, we show\nthat starting from a randomly perturbed circular shape, this instability can\nlead to keratocyte-like shapes. Simulations predict that different adhesion\nkinetics and membrane tension can result in different cell motility modes\nincluding gliding, zigzag, rotating, and sometimes chaotic movements.

In 2020, the Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval to pembrolizumab in combination\nwith chemotherapy for patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer.\nHowever, only a subgroup of advanced TNBC patients live longer whose tumors\nhave a PD-L1 Combined Positive Score of at least 10 (CPS>=10). There is still\nan unmet medical need to provide alternative treatment for the rest of\npatients. Interestingly, a few of patients at UCSD Moores Cancer Center were\nfound to have had excellent responses to pembrolizumab despite low CPS scores\n(termed Elite Responders). The hypothesis of this project is that there may be\nan alternative immune response mechanism and/or crosstalk happening between the\ninnate and adaptive immune systems, especially in Natural Killer Cells and\nMacrophages, that contributed to this unexpected excellent response. Our\nprocedure used ACDBio RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescence v2 method to spatially\nanalyze innate immune cells (Natural Killer cells and macrophages) and adaptive\nimmune cells (T-cells) in the Tumor Micro Environment. Our data demonstrated\nincreased tumor infiltration of innate immune cells (macrophage and Natural\nKiller cells) in the Elite Responders. This conclusion indicated the joint\neffort of two immune systems (innate and adaptive) which eventually led to\nincreased survival.\n",

Similarly to the\nexperimental quantitative analysis, we compute a score that quantifies the\nlevel of immune cell infiltration into the tumour. The results of numerical\nsimulations indicate that the motility of immune cells, their capability to\ninfiltrate through tumour cells, their growth rate and the interplay between\nthese cell parameters can affect the level of immune cell infiltration in\ndifferent ways.

At the microscopic level, bacterial cells show an enhanced activity\nin the vicinity of yeast cells. We observe this behaviour even when the live\nyeast cells are replaced with heat-killed cells or with spherical glass beads\nof similar morphology, which suggests that the observed behaviour is not\nspecific to the biology of microbes. Upon careful investigation, we find that a\nfluid pool is formed around yeast cells which facilitates the swimming of the\nflagellated P. aeruginosa , causing their enhanced motility. Using mathematical\nmodeling we demonstrate how this local enhancement of bacterial motility leads\nto the enhanced spread observed at the level of the plate. We find that the\ndynamics of the fluid landscape around the bacteria, mediated by the growing\nyeast lawn, affects the spreading. For instance, when the yeast lawn grows\nfaster, a bacterial colony prefers a lower initial loading of yeast cells for\noptimum enhancement in the spread. We confirm our predictions using Candida\nalbicans and C. neoformans, at different initial compositions.

In vitro\nExperiments have shown that such fluid flow can direct tumour cell movement\nupstream or downstream depending on the balance between the competing\nmechanisms of tensotaxis and autologous chemotaxis. In this work we develop a\nprobabilistic-continuum, two-phase model for cell migration in response to\ninterstitial flow. We use a kinetic description for the cell-velocity\nprobability density function, and model the flow-dependent stimuli as forcing\nterms which bias cell migration upstream and downstream. Using velocity-space\naveraging, we reformulate the model as a system of continuum equations for the\nspatio-temporal evolution of the cell volume fraction and flux, in response to\nforcing terms which depend on the local direction and magnitude of the\nmechanochemical cues. We specialise our model to describe a one-dimensional\ncell layer subject to fluid flow. Using a combination of numerical simulations\nand asymptotic analysis, we delineate the parameter regime where transitions\nfrom downstream to upstream cell migration occur. As has been observed\nexperimentally, the model predicts downstream-oriented, chemotactic migration\nat low cell volume fractions, and upstream-oriented, tensotactic migration at\nlarger volume fractions. We show that the locus of the critical volume\nfraction, at which the system transitions from downstream to upstream\nmigration, is dominated by the ratio of the rate of chemokine secretion and\nadvection. Our model also predicts that, because the tensotactic stimulus\ndepends strongly on the cell volume fraction, upstream, tensotaxis-dominated\nmigration occurs only transiently when the cells are initially seeded, and\ntransitions to downstream, chemotaxis-dominated migration occur at later times\ndue to the dispersive effect of cell diffusion.\n",

Very often, external stimuli induce pulsatile\nbehaviors in intermediaries of the cascade of increasing frequency with the\nstimulus strength. This is characteristic of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals\ninvolving Ca$^{2+}$ release through Inositol Trisphosphate Receptors\n(IP$_3$Rs). The mean frequency of IP$_3$R-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ pulses has been\nobserved to scale exponentially with the stimulus strength in many cell types.\nIn this paper we use a simple ODE model of the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics\nfor parameters for which there is one excitable fixed point. Including\nfluctuations through an additive noise term, we derive the mean escape rate\nfrom the stationary state and, thus, the mean interpulse time, as a function of\nthe fraction, $\\beta$, of readily openable IP$_3$Rs. Using an IP$_3$R kinetic\nmodel, experimental observations of spatially resolved Ca$^{2+}$ signals and\nprevious estimates of the IP$_3$ produced upon stimulation we quantify the\nfluctuations and relate $\\beta$ to [IP$_3$] and the stimulus strength. In this\nway we determine that the mean interpulse time can be approximated by an\nexponential function of the latter for ranges such that the covered mean time\nintervals are similar or larger than those observed experimentally. The study\nthus provides an easily interpretable explanation, applicable to other\npulsatile signaling intermediaries, of the observed exponential dependence\nbetween frequency and stimulus, a key feature that makes frequency encoding\nqualitatively different from other ways commonly used by cells to \"read\" their\nenvironment.\n",

To address these issues, we\nhave developed a mathematical model for early atherosclerosis in which the MDM\npopulation is structured by phenotype and lipid content.

We show further that the MDM phenotype distribution always attains a\nlocal maximum, while the lipid content distribution may be unimodal, adopt a\nquasi-uniform profile or decrease monotonically. Pathological lesions exhibit a\nlocal maximum in both the phenotype and lipid content MDM distributions, with\nthe maximum at an inflammatory phenotype and near the lipid content capacity\nrespectively.

Starting from the description of single-cell\ndynamics driven by the Snail protein, we construct the corresponding kinetic\ntransport equation that describes the evolution of the cell distribution.\nSubsequently, we employ proper scaling arguments to formally derive the\nequations for the statistical moments of the cell distribution, which govern\nthe macroscopic tumor dynamics. Numerical simulations of the model are\nperformed in various scenarios with biological relevance to provide insights\ninto the role of the multiple tactic terms, the impact of Snail expression on\ncell proliferation, and the emergence of hypoxia-induced migration patterns.\nMoreover, quantitative comparison with experimental data shows the model's\nreliability in measuring the impact of Snail transcription on cell migratory\npotential. Through our findings, we shed light on the potential of our\nmathematical framework in advancing the understanding of the biological\nmechanisms driving tumor progression.\n",

To\nexamine the efficiency of this process, previous studies have investigated the\nlimit of estimation accuracy for gradients. However, these studies assume that\nthe cell shape and gradient are constant, and do not consider how adaptive\nregulation of cell shape affects the estimation limit. Dynamics of cell shape\nduring gradient sensing is biologically ubiquitous and can influence the\nestimation by altering the way the concentration is measured, and cells may\nstrategically regulate their shape to improve estimation accuracy. To address\nthis gap, we investigate the estimation limits in dynamic situations where\ncells change shape adaptively depending on the sensed signal. We approach this\nproblem by analyzing the stationary solution of the Bayesian nonlinear\nfiltering equation. By applying diffusion approximation to the ligand-receptor\nbinding process and the Laplace method for the posterior expectation under a\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio regime, we obtain an analytical expression for the\nestimation limit. This expression indicates that estimation accuracy can be\nimproved by elongating perpendicular to the estimated direction, which is also\nconfirmed by numerical simulations. Our analysis provides a basis for\nclarifying the interplay between estimation and control in gradient sensing and\nsheds light on how cells optimize their shape to enhance chemotactic\nefficiency.\n",

Carnot 200 years ago, corpuscularianism (the philosophy\nthat the states of individual molecules determine the state of a system of\nthose molecules) is still widely used to describe biological function. Nowhere\nis this more evident than in proposed power stroke mechanisms of muscle\ncontraction. Muscle's power stroke occurs when muscle shortens against a\nmechanical load, performing work over time. While many mechanisms have been\nproposed, the actual power stroke mechanism of muscle contraction remains\ncontested. Here I consider four distinctly different proposed mechanisms and\nassess their history and scientific merit. I show that over the past 65 years,\nmolecular biologists have ignored Carnot for their corpuscular mechanic\nconvictions in proposing a series of molecular power stroke mechanisms that\nregress from 19th century thermodynamics to an obsolete 17th century philosophy\nto a structural determinism invoked today that predates science. An isothermal\npower stroke in a thermodynamic muscle work loop, analogous to the power stoke\nin a Carnot cycle, rectifies this historic scientific blunder, defining the\nconfluence of the bottom-up mechanics and chemistry of myosin motors and the\ntop-down mechanics and chemistry of muscle. Specifically, created by thermal\nscaling, the increase in entropy with muscle's thermodynamic power stroke\nchemically exists within muscle and defines the irreversible energetics and\nkinetics of muscle contraction (the arrow of time).\n",

We use this model to explore the effect on plaque fate\nof SMC phenotype switching.

In doing so, we\nderive an ordinary differential equation model that explores how the balance of\nangiogenesis, cell death rates, genetic instability, and replication rates give\nrise to different kinetics in the development of cancer. The key predictions of\nthe model are that cancer develops fastest through a particular ordering of\nmutations and that mutations in genes that maintain genomic integrity would be\nthe most deleterious type of mutations to inherit. In addition, we perform a\nsensitivity analysis on the parameters included in the model to determine the\nprobable contribution of each. This paper presents a novel approach to viewing\nthe genetic basis of cancer from a systems biology perspective and provides the\ngroundwork for other models that can be directly tied to clinical and molecular\ndata.\n",

Here we review recent theoretical work that aims to describe the\ncytoskeleton as a polar continuum driven out of equilibrium by internal\nchemical reactions. This work uses methods from soft condensed matter physics\nand has led to the formulation of a general framework for the description of\nthe structure and rheology of active suspension of polar filaments and\nmolecular motors.\n",

Materials and methods: We have used\nmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of\nindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal\npopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic\nequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different\nclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate\nof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their\noffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones\ndid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting\nthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed\ndistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model\nassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive\ncell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,\nwe have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number\nof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed\ndistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were\nrendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal\ngrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell\npopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At\nleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of\nmitochondria.\n",

The assembly of\nsuch multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells:\nover millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely\nsophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms may\nnot be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are\ninterested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still\nachieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential\nequation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing\nspiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to\nrepresent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is\nfollowed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to\nemit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of\nsingle-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball\natop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug. The similarity with the behaviour of\nmodern Dictyostelium slime molds signalling with cyclic adenosine monophosphate\n(cAMP) is striking.\n",

Our computer simulations are based on a\nLangevin equation accounting for hydrodynamic interactions, thermal\nfluctuations and adhesive interactions. In contrast to earlier approaches, our\nmodel not only includes stochastic rules for the formation and rupture of\nbonds, but also fully resolves both receptor and ligand positions. We identify\nfive different dynamic states of motion in regard to the translational and\nangular velocities of the cell. The transitions between the different states\nare mapped out in a dynamic state diagram as a function of the rates for bond\nformation and rupture. For example, as the cell starts to adhere under the\naction of bonds, its translational and angular velocities become synchronized\nand the dynamic state changes from slipping to rolling. We also investigate the\neffect of non-molecular parameters. In particular, we find that an increase in\nviscosity of the medium leads to a characteristic expansion of the region of\nstable rolling to the expense of the region of firm adhesion, but not to the\nexpense of the regions of free or transient motion. Our results can be used in\nan inverse approach to determine single bond parameters from flow chamber data\non rolling adhesion.\n",

Numerical\nanalysis of equations describing regulation by artificial inducers revealed two\nnatural bistability parameters that can be used to control the range of inducer\nconcentrations over which the model exhibits bistability. By tuning these\nbistability parameters, we found a family of biophysically reasonable systems\nthat are consistent with an experimentally determined bistable region for\ninduction by thio-methylgalactoside (Ozbudak et al. Nature 427:737, 2004). The\nmodel predicts that bistability can be abolished when passive transport or\npermease export becomes sufficiently large; the former case is especially\nrelevant to induction by isopropyl-beta, D-thiogalactopyranoside. To model\nregulation by lactose, we developed similar equations in which allolactose, a\nmetabolic intermediate in lactose metabolism and a natural inducer of lac, is\nthe inducer. For biophysically reasonable parameter values, these equations\nyield no bistability in response to induction by lactose; however, systems with\nan unphysically small permease-dependent export effect can exhibit small\namounts of bistability for limited ranges of parameter values. These results\ncast doubt on the relevance of bistability in the lac operon within the natural\ncontext of E. coli, and help shed light on the controversy among existing\ntheoretical studies that address this issue. The results also suggest an\nexperimental approach to address the relevance of bistability in the lac operon\nwithin the natural context of E. coli.\n",

Amoebae, fibroblasts, neutrophils and growth cones all behave in this\nway. Little is known however about cell motion and searching behavior in the\nabsence of a signal. Is individual cell motion best characterized as a random\nwalk? Do individual cells have a search strategy when they are beyond the range\nof the signal they would otherwise move toward? Here we ask if single,\nisolated, Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium amoebae bias their motion in the\nabsence of external cues. We placed single well-isolated Dictyostelium and\nPolysphondylium cells on a nutrient-free agar surface and followed them at 10\nsec intervals for ~10 hr, then analyzed their motion with respect to velocity,\nturning angle, persistence length, and persistence time, comparing the results\nto the expectation for a variety of different types of random motion. We find\nthat amoeboid behavior is well described by a special kind of random motion:\nAmoebae show a long persistence time (~10 min) beyond which they start to lose\ntheir direction; they move forward in a zig-zag manner; and they make turns\nevery 1-2 min on average. They bias their motion by remembering the last turn\nand turning away from it. Interpreting the motion as consisting of runs and\nturns, the duration of a run and the amplitude of a turn are both found to be\nexponentially distributed. We show that this behavior greatly improves their\nchances of finding a target relative to performing a random walk. We believe\nthat other eukaryotic cells may employ a strategy similar to Dictyostelium when\nseeking conditions or signal sources not yet within range of their detection\nsystem.\n",

Since the former can be regarded as the basis to realize\nthe latter, playing essential roles in various cellular functions, it is\nimportant to investigate spontaneous movement quantitatively at different\nphysiological conditions in relation to cellular physiological functions. For\nthat purpose, we observed a series of spontaneous movements by Dictyostelium\ncells at different developmental periods by using a single cell tracking\nsystem. Using statistical analysis of these traced data, we found that cells\nshowed complex dynamics with anomalous diffusion and that their velocity\ndistribution had power-law tails in all conditions. Furthermore, as development\nproceeded, average velocity and persistency of the movement increased and as\ntoo did the exponential behavior in the velocity distribution. Based on these\nresults, we succeeded in applying a generalized Langevin model to the\nexperimental data. With this model, we discuss the relation of spontaneous cell\nmovement to cellular physiological function and its relevance to behavioral\nstrategies for cell survival.\n",

Moreover, the system is subjected to an\nexternal additive noise which mimics the influence of the environment of the\ntumor. The stationary probability distribution Ps is derived depending on the\nfinite correlation time, the immunization rate and the strength of the\ncrosscorrelation.

Two distinct sources contribute to the noise in\nsuch a system: intrinsic noise, inherent in the studied reactions, and\nextrinsic noise generated in other parts of the network or in the environment.\nWe study the effect of extrinsic noise entering the system through a nonlinear\nuptake reaction which acts as a nonlinear filter. Varying input noise intensity\nvaries the mean of the noise after the passage through the filter, which\nchanges the stability properties of the system. The steady-state displacement\ndue to small noise is independent on the kinetics of the system but it only\ndepends on the nonlinearity of the input function.\n  For monotonically increasing and concave input functions such as the\nMichaelis-Menten uptake rate, we give a simple argument based on the\nsmall-noise expansion, which enables qualitative predictions of the\nsteady-state displacement only by inspection of experimental data: when weak\nand rapid noise enters the system through a Michaelis-Menten reaction, then the\ngraph of the system's steady states vs. the mean of the input signal always\nshifts to the right as noise intensity increases.\n  We test the predictions on two models of lac operon, where TMG/lactose uptake\nis driven by a Michaelis-Menten enzymatic process.

Whereas the physical limits of\nconcentration sensing by cells have been explored, there is no theory for the\nphysical limits of gradient sensing.

We find that\nthe perfectly absorbing sphere is superior to the perfectly monitoring sphere,\nboth for concentration and gradient sensing, since previously observed\nparticles are never remeasured. The superiority of the absorbing sphere helps\nexplain the presence at the surfaces of cells of signal degrading enzymes, such\nas PDE for cAMP in Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty) and BAR1 for mating factor\nalpha in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast).

For spatially homogeneous\ncase, the steady state analysis of the model is carried out. The effects of\nsingle photodynamic impact are numerically simulated. In the case of strong\nimmune response we found that the photodynamic therapy (PDT) gives rise to the\nsubstantial shrinkage of tumor size which is accompanied by the increase of\ninterleukin-2 concentration. On the contrary, the photodynamic stimulation of\nweak immune response is shown to be insufficient to reduce the tumor. These\nfindings indicate the important role of anti-cancer immune response in the\nlong-term tumor control after PDT.\n",

We have extended\nour previous mathematical model describing the nonlinear dynamics of Th1-Th2\nregulation by including Treg cells and their major cytokines. We hypothesize\nthat immunotherapy mainly acts on the T cell level and that the decisive\nprocess can be regarded as a dynamical phenomenon. The model consists of\nnonlinear differential equations which describe the proliferation and mutual\nsuppression of different T cell subsets. The old version of the model was based\nupon the Th1-Th2 paradigm and is successful in describing the \"Th1-Th2 switch\"\nwhich was considered the decisive event during specific immunotherapy. In\nrecent years, however, the Th1-Th2 paradigm has been questioned and therefore,\nwe have investigated a modified model in order to account for the influence of\na regulatory T cell type. We examined the extended model by means of numerical\nsimulations and analytical methods. As the modified model is more complex, we\nhad to develop new methods to portray its characteristics. The concept of\nstable manifolds of fixed points of a stroboscobic map turned out to be\nespecially important. We found that when including regulatory T cells, our\nmodel can describe the events in allergen-specific immunotherapy more\naccurately. Our results suggest that the decisive effect of immunotherapy, the\nincreased proliferation of Treg and suppression of Th2 cells, crucially depends\non the administration of high dose injections right before the maintenance\nphase sets in.

        "summary": "  B cells signaling in response to antigen is proportional to antigen affinity,\na process known as affinity discrimination. Recent research suggests that B\ncells can acquire antigen in membrane-bound form on the surface of\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs), with signaling being initiated within a few\nseconds of B cell/APC contact. During the earliest stages of B cell/APC\ncontact, B cell receptors (BCRs) on protrusions of the B cell surface bind to\nantigen on the APC surface and form micro-clusters of 10-100 BCR/Antigen\ncomplexes. In this study, we use computational modeling to show that B cell\naffinity discrimination at the level of BCR-antigen micro-clusters requires a\nthreshold antigen binding time, in a manner similar to kinetic proofreading. We\nfind that if BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding\nantigen, there is a loss in serial engagement due to the increase in bond\nlifetime as koff decreases. This results in decreasing signaling strength as\naffinity increases. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR before\nthe latter becomes signaling-capable favors high affinity BCR-antigen bonds, as\nthese long-lived bonds can better fulfill the threshold time requirement than\nlow-affinity bonds. A threshold antigen binding time of ~10 seconds results in\nmonotonically increasing signaling with affinity, replicating the affinity\ndiscrimination pattern observed in B cell activation experiments. This time\nmatches well (within order of magnitude) with the experimentally observed time\n(~ 20 seconds) required for the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and\nlipid raft-mediated conformational changes that lead to association with Syk.\n",

Extending such models to study the collective behavior of neural\npopulations involves thousands of equations and can be very expensive\ncomputationally. For this reason, low dimensional population models that\ncapture biophysical aspects of networks are needed.\n  \\noindent The present paper uses a firing-rate model to study mechanisms that\ntrigger and stop transitions between tonic and phasic population firing. These\nmechanisms are captured through a two-dimensional system, which can potentially\nbe extended to include interactions between different areas of the nervous\nsystem with a small number of equations. The typical behavior of midbrain\ndopaminergic neurons in the rodent is used as an example to illustrate and\ninterpret our results.\n  \\noindent The model presented here can be used as a building block to study\ninteractions between networks of neurons.

A discussion of how tumor growth is affected by chemotherapeutic\ntreatment is then described.

Particle engulfment involves\nparticle recognition by cell-surface receptors, signaling and remodeling of the\nactin cytoskeleton to guide the membrane around the particle in a zipper-like\nfashion. Despite the signaling complexity, phagocytosis also depends strongly\non biophysical parameters, such as particle shape, and the need for\nactin-driven force generation remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a\nnovel, three-dimensional and stochastic biophysical model of phagocytosis, and\nstudy the engulfment of particles of various sizes and shapes, including spiral\nand rod-shaped particles reminiscent of bacteria. Highly curved shapes are not\ntaken up, in line with recent experimental results. Furthermore, we\nsurprisingly find that even without actin-driven force generation, engulfment\nproceeds in a large regime of parameter values, albeit more slowly and with\nhighly variable phagocytic cups. We experimentally confirm these predictions\nusing fibroblasts, transfected with immunoreceptor FcyRIIa for engulfment of\nimmunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Specifically, we compare the wild-type\nreceptor with a mutant receptor, unable to signal to the actin cytoskeleton.\nBased on the reconstruction of phagocytic cups from imaging data, we indeed\nshow that cells are able to engulf small particles even without support from\nbiological actin-driven processes.

We find that if\nBCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding antigen, the\nloss in serial engagement as affinity increases results in weaker signaling\nwith increasing affinity. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR for\nseveral seconds before the latter becomes signaling-capable, similar to kinetic\nproofreading, is needed to overcome the loss in serial engagement due to\nincreasing antigen affinity, and replicate the monotonic increase in B cell\nsignaling with affinity observed in B cell activation experiments.

The bursting arises as the fast spiking behavior of the\nneuron is modulated by the slow oscillatory behavior in the ion concentration\nvariables, and vice versa. By separating these time scales and studying the\nbifurcation structure of the neuron, we catalog several qualitatively different\nbursting profiles that are strikingly similar to those seen in experimental\npreparations.

While the directional motion\nis typically dictated by an external signal, the actual motility is also\nrestricted by physical constraints, such as the presence of other cells and the\nextracellular matrix. The ability to successfully navigate in the presence of\nobstacles is not only essential for organisms, but might prove relevant in the\nstudy of autonomous robotic motion.\n  Methodology/principal findings: We study a computational model of amoeboid\nchemotactic navigation under differing conditions, from motion in an\nobstacle-free environment to navigation between obstacles and finally to moving\nin a maze. We use the maze as a simple stand-in for a motion task with severe\nconstraints, as might be expected in dense extracellular matrix. Whereas agents\nusing simple chemotaxis can successfully navigate around small obstacles, the\npresence of large barriers can often lead to agent trapping. We further show\nthat employing a simple memory mechanism, namely secretion of a repulsive\nchemical by the agent, helps the agent escape from such trapping.\n  Conclusions/significance: Our main conclusion is that cells employing simple\nchemotactic strategies will often be unable to navigate through maze-like\ngeometries, but a simple chemical marker mechanism (which we refer to as\n\"self-assistance\") significantly improves success rates. This realization\nprovides important insights into mechanisms that might be employed by real\ncells migrating in complex environments as well as clues for the design of\nrobotic navigation strategies. The results can be extended to more complicated\nmulti-cellular systems and can be used in the study of mammalian cell migration\nand cancer metastasis.\n",

In this study, we propose a\ngeneral theoretical framework that enables us to understand the dependence of\ntemporal precision on network parameters including size, connectivity, and\ncoupling intensity; this effect has been poorly understood to date. Our\nframework is based on a phase oscillator model that is applicable to general\noscillator networks with any coupling mechanism if coupling and noise are\nsufficiently weak. In particular, we can manage general directed and weighted\nnetworks. We quantify the precision of the activity of a single cell and the\nmean activity of an arbitrary subset of cells.

It is known that BCRs form oligomers\nupon encountering antigen, and that the size and rate of formation of these\noligomers increase with affinity. In our simulation, we have introduced a\nrequirement that only BCR-antigen complexes that are part of an oligomer can\nengage cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as Src-family kinases. Our\nsimulation shows that as affinity increases, not only does the number of\ncollected antigen increases, but so does signaling activity.

We start this paper by proving that, if we\nfix the values of the source nodes (nodes with in-degree 0), the expected\nnumber of fixed points of any RBN is one (independently of the topology we\nchoose). For finding such fixed points we use the {\\alpha}-asynchronous\ndynamics (where every node is updated independently with probability 0 <\n{\\alpha} < 1). In fact, it is well-known that asynchrony avoids the cycle\nattractors into which parallel dynamics tends to fall.

By contrast,\nin the parallel regime, the percentage of initial configurations reaching a\nfixed point (for the same networks) is dramatically smaller.

An unexpected observation was that the net applied force on the\namoeba did not seem to be the primary factor that limited its ability to climb.\nInstead, it appeared that the amoeba stalled when it was no longer able to\nsupport a pseudopodium against the applied gravity field. The high g-load bend\nthe pseudopodium thereby preventing its attachment to the target point directly\nahead of the cell. In this paper we further refine this idea by identifying the\nbending of the pseudopodium with the onset of elastic instability of a beam\nunder its own weight. It is shown that the principal features of the experiment\nmay be understood through this model and an estimate for the limiting g-load in\nreasonable accord with the experimental measurements is recovered.\n",

Previous theoretical studies have shown that faster moving cells\nfavor synchronization across a population of locally coupled genetic\noscillators. An important assumption in these studies is that cells can\nimmediately interact with their new neighbors after arriving at a new location.\nHowever, intercellular interactions in cellular systems may need some time to\nbecome fully established. How movement affects synchronization in this\nsituation has not been examined. Here we develop a coupled phase oscillator\nmodel in which we consider cell movement and the gradual recovery of\nintercellular coupling experienced by a cell after movement, characterized by a\nmoving rate and a coupling recovery rate respectively. We find (1) an optimal\nmoving rate for synchronization, and (2) a critical moving rate above which\nachieving synchronization is not possible. These results indicate that the\nextent to which movement enhances synchrony is limited by a gradual recovery of\ncoupling. These findings suggest that the ratio of time scales of movement and\nsignaling recovery is critical for information transfer between moving cells.\n",

The two parts of the\ngenome compete for limited adaptive resources thereby interfering with the\nability of the house-keeping part of the genome to adequately perform\nreparative and adaptive functions in post mitotic cells. The necessity to\ncomplete the ontgenesis program, leads to increased activity of the\nmulticellular components of the genome.

A first obstacle along this path is to\ndecipher the mechanisms by which protein aggregates are targeted to specific\nintercellular locations. Here, using an integrated approach based on\nindividual-based modeling, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and automated\nimage analysis, we show that the movement of aging-related protein aggregates\nin E. coli is purely diffusive (Brownian). Using single-particle tracking of\nprotein aggregates in live E. coli cells, we estimated the average size and\ndiffusion constant of the aggregates. Our results evidence that the aggregates\npassively diffuse within the cell, with diffusion constants that depend on\ntheir size in agreement with the Stokes-Einstein law. However, the aggregate\ndisplacements along the cell long axis are confined to a region that roughly\ncorresponds to the nucleoid-free space in the cell pole, thus confirming the\nimportance of increased macromolecular crowding in the nucleoids. We thus used\n3d individual-based modeling to show that these three ingredients (diffusion,\naggregation and diffusion hindrance in the nucleoids) are sufficient and\nnecessary to reproduce the available experimental data on aggregate\nlocalization in the cells.

        "summary": "  Electrical neural signalling typically takes place at the time-scale of\nmilliseconds, and is typically modeled using the cable equation. This is a good\napproximation for processes when ionic concentrations vary little during the\ntime course of a simulation. During periods of intense neural signalling,\nhowever, the local extracellular K+ concentration may increase by several\nmillimolars. Clearance of excess K+ likely depends partly on diffusion in the\nextracellular space, partly on local uptake by- and intracellular transport\nwithin astrocytes. This process takes place at the time scale of seconds, and\ncan not be modeled accurately without accounting for the spatiotemporal\nvariations in ion concentrations. The work presented here consists of two main\nparts: First, we developed a general electrodiffusive formalism for modeling\nion concentration dynamics in a one-dimensional geometry, including both an\nintra- and extracellular domain. The formalism was based on the Nernst-Planck\nequations. It ensures (i) consistency between the membrane potential and ion\nconcentrations, (ii) global particle/charge conservation, and (iii) accounts\nfor diffusion and concentration dependent variations in resistivities. Second,\nwe applied the formalism to model how astrocytes exchange ions with the ECS,\nand identified the key astrocytic mechanisms involved in K+ removal from high\nconcentration regions. We found that a local increase in extracellular\nK\\textsuperscript{+} evoked a local depolarization of the astrocyte membrane,\nwhich at the same time (i) increased the local astrocytic uptake of\nK\\textsuperscript{+}, (ii) suppressed extracellular transport of K+, (iii)\nincreased transport of K+ within astrocytes, and (iv) facilitated astrocytic\nrelase of K+ in extracellular low concentration regions. In summary, these\nmechanisms seem optimal for shielding the extracellular space from excess K+.\n",

The smooth top and\nvalley-strewn bottom of the hill represents their undifferentiated and\ndifferentiated states respectively. Although mathematical ideas rooted in\nnonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory have been used to quantify this\npicture, the importance of time delays arising from multistep chemical\nreactions or cellular shape transformations have been ignored so far. We argue\nthat this feature is crucial in understanding cell differentiation and explore\nthe role of time delay in a model of a single gene regulatory circuit. We show\nthat the interplay of time-dependant drive and delay introduces a new regime\nwhere the system shows sustained oscillations between the two admissible steady\nstates. We interpret these results in the light of recent perplexing\nexperiments on inducing the pluripotent state in mouse somatic cells. We also\ncomment on how such an oscillatory state can provide a framework for\nunderstanding more general feedback circuits in cell development.\n",

Such self-organized polarity is induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking\nin the intracellular activities, which produces an emergent memory effect\nassociated with slow-changing mode. Therefore, spontaneously established\npolarity should play a pivotal role in efficient chemotaxis. In this study, we\ndevelop a model of chemotactic cell migration that demonstrates the connection\nbetween intracellular polarity and chemotactic accuracy. Spontaneous polarity\nformation and gradient sensing are described by a stochastic differential\nequation. We demonstrate that the direction of polarity persists over a\ncharacteristic time that is predicted to depend on the chemoattractant\nconcentration. Next, we theoretically derive the chemotactic accuracy as a\nfunction of both the gradient sensing ability and the characteristic time of\npolarity direction. The results indicate that the accuracy can be improved by\nthe polarity. Furthermore, the analysis of chemotactic accuracy suggests that\naccuracy is maximized at some optimal responsiveness to extracellular\nperturbations. To obtain the model parameters, we studied the correlation time\nof random cell migration in cell tracking analysis of Dictyostelium cells. As\npredicted, the persistence time depended on the chemoattractant concentration.\nFrom the fitted parameters, we inferred that polarized Dictyosteium cells can\nrespond optimally to a chemical gradient. Chemotactic accuracy was almost 10\ntimes larger than can be achieved by non-polarized gradient sensing. Using the\nobtained parameter values, we show that polarity also improves the dynamic\nrange of chemotaxis.\n",

Knowing the\nexpected temporal evolution of the proportion of normal tissue cells, compared\nto stem-like and non-stem like cancer cells, gives an indication about the\nprogression of the disease and indicates the expected response to interventions\nwith drugs. Such processes have been modeled using Markov processes. An\nessential step for the simulation of such models is then the determination of\nstate transition probabilities. We here consider the experimentally more\nrealistic scenario in which the measurement of cell population sizes is noisy,\nleading to a particular hidden Markov model. In this context, randomness in\nmeasurement is related to noisy measurements, which are used for the estimation\nof the transition probability matrix. Randomness in sampling, on the other\nhand, is here related to the error in estimating the state probability from\nsmall cell populations. Using aggregated data of fluorescence-activated cell\nsorting (FACS) measurement, we develop a minimum mean square error estimator\n(MMSE) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and formulate two problems to find\nthe minimum number of required samples and measurements to guarantee the\naccuracy of predicted population sizes using a transition probability matrix\nestimated from noisy data. We analyze the properties of two estimators for\ndifferent noise distributions and prove an optimal solution for Gaussian\ndistributions with the MMSE. Our numerical results show, that for noisy\nmeasurements the convergence mechanism of transition probabilities and steady\nstates differ widely from the real values if one uses the standard\ndeterministic approach in which measurements are assumed to be noise free.\n",

The cell in\ncontact with substrate has only one (adhesion) point to work with, and thus a\nnew method of measurement needs to be invented. The aim of this theoretical\nwork is to develop a self-consistent physical model for mechanosensitivity, a\nprocess by which a cell detects the mechanical stiffness of its environment\n(e.g. a substrate it is attached to via adhesion points) and generates an\nappropriate chemical signaling to remodel itself in response to this\nenvironment. The model uses the molecular mechanosensing complex of latent\nTGF-$\\beta$ attached to the adhesion point as the biomarker. We show that the\nunderlying Brownian motion in the substrate is the reference element in the\nmeasuring process. The model produces the closed expression for the rate of\nrelease of active TGF-$\\beta$, which depends on the substrate stiffness and the\npulling force coming from the cell in a subtle and non-trivial way. It is\nconsistent with basic experimental data showing an increase in signal for\nstiffer substrates and higher pulling forces. In addition, we find that for\neach cell there is a range of stiffness where a homeostatic configuration of\nthe cell can be achieved, outside of which the cell either relaxes its\ncytoskeletal forces and detaches from the very weak substrate, or generates an\nincreasingly strong pulling force through stress fibers with a positive\nfeedback loop on very stiff substrates. In this way, the theory offers the\nunderlying mechanism for the myofibroblast conversion in wound healing and\nsmooth muscle cell dysfunction in cardiac disease.\n",

Experiments on endocytosis in yeast all\nagree that (i) actin polymerizes into a network of filaments exerting active\nforces on the membrane to deform it and (ii) the large scale membrane\ndeformation is tubular in shape. There are three competing proposals, in\ncontrast, for precisely how the actin filament network organizes itself to\ndrive the deformation. We use variational approaches and numerical simulations\nto address this competition by analyzing a meso-scale model of actin-mediated\nendocytosis in yeast. The meso-scale model breaks up the invagination process\ninto three stages: (i) initiation, where clathrin interacts with the membrane\nvia adaptor proteins, (ii) elongation, where the membrane is then further\ndeformed by polymerizing actin filaments, followed by (iii) pinch-off. Our\nresults suggest that the pinch-off mechanism may be assisted by a pearling-like\ninstability. We rule out two of the three competing proposals for the\norganization of the actin filament network during the elongation stage. These\ntwo proposals could possibly be important in the pinch-off stage, however,\nwhere additional actin polymerization helps break off the vesicle.

Here we present a generalized multi-phenotypic cancer model by\nintegrating cell plasticity with the conventional hierarchical structure of\ncancer cells. We prove that under very weak assumption, the nonlinear dynamics\nof multi-phenotypic proportions in our model has only one stable steady state\nand no stable limit cycle.

Furthermore,\naccording to the transient analysis of our model, it is found that cancer cell\nplasticity plays an essential role in maintaining the phenotypic diversity in\ncancer especially during the transient dynamics. Two biological examples with\nexperimental data show that the phenotypic conversions from NCSSs to CSCs\ngreatly contribute to the transient growth of CSCs proportion shortly after the\ndrastic reduction of it. In particular, an interesting overshooting phenomenon\nof CSCs proportion arises in three-phenotypic example.

Closure\ndynamics was quantified by an epithelization coefficient $D = \\sigma_p/\\xi$\ndefined as the ratio of the border protrusive stress $\\sigma_p$ to the friction\ncoefficient $\\xi$ between epithelium and substrate.

In this work, we investigate how oscillations in the\nactomyosin cytoskeleton drive cell shape changes during the process of Dorsal\nClosure, a morphogenetic event in Drosophila embryo development whereby\nepidermal continuity is generated through the pulsatile apical area reduction\nof cells constituting the amnioserosa (AS) tissue. We present a theoretical\nmodel of AS cell dynamics by which the oscillatory behaviour arises due to a\ncoupling between active Myosin-driven forces, actin turnover and cell\ndeformation. Oscillations in our model are cell-autonomous and are modulated by\nneighbour coupling, and our model accurately reproduces the oscillatory\ndynamics of AS cells and their amplitude and frequency evolution. A key\nprediction arising from our model is that the rate of actin turnover and Myosin\ncontractile force must increase during DC in order to reproduce the decrease in\namplitude and period of cell area oscillations observed in vivo. This\nprediction opens up new ways to think about the molecular underpinnings of AS\ncell oscillations and their link to net tissue contraction and suggests the\nform of future experimental measurements.\n",

Drosophila dorsal closure (DC) has emerged as\na model system for studying the interplay between tissue mechanics and cellular\nactivity. Thereby, the amnioserosa (AS) generates one of the major forces that\ndrive DC through the apical contraction of its constituent cells. We combined\nquantitation of live data, genetic and mechanical perturbation and cell\nbiology, to investigate how mechanical properties and contraction rate emerge\nfrom cytoskeletal activity. We found that a decrease in Myosin phosphorylation\ninduces a fluidization of AS cells which become more compliant. Conversely, an\nincrease in Myosin phosphorylation and an increase in actin linear\npolymerization induce a solidification of cells. Contrary to expectation, these\ntwo perturbations have an opposite effect on the strain rate of cells during\nDC. While an increase in actin polymerization increases the contraction rate of\nAS cells, an increase in Myosin phosphorylation gives rise to cells that\ncontract very slowly. The quantification of how the perturbation induced by\nlaser ablation decays throughout the tissue revealed that the tissue in these\ntwo mutant backgrounds reacts very differently. We suggest that the differences\nin the strain rate of cells in situations where Myosin activity or actin\npolymerization is increased arise from changes in how the contractile forces\nare transmitted and coordinated across the tissue through ECadherin mediated\nadhesion. Our results show that there is an optimal level of Myosin activity to\ngenerate efficient contraction and suggest that the architecture of the actin\ncytoskeleton and the dynamics of adhesion complexes are important parameters\nfor the emergence of coordinated activity throughout the tissue.\n",

The selection dynamics of a mutant\ncancer stem cell should be investigated in the light of a stem cell\nproliferation hierarchy and presence of a non-stem cell population.

We determine how\nthese new factors change the conditions for a successful mutant invasion and\ndiscuss the variation on the steady state fraction of the population as\ndifferent model parameters are changed. By including the phenotypic\nplasticity/dedifferentiation, in which a progenitor/differentiated cell can\ntransform back into a cancer stem cell, we show that the effective fitness of\nmutant stem cells is not only determined by their proliferation and death rates\nbut also according to their dedifferentiation potential.

Remarkably, these observations can be\nexplained by a simple mathematical model that combines drug transport and\nbinding with physiological constraints. Our model reveals that growth-dependent\nsusceptibility is controlled by a single parameter characterizing the\n`reversibility' of antibiotic transport and binding. This parameter provides a\nspectrum-classification of antibiotic growth-dependent efficacy that appears to\ncorrespond at its extremes to existing binary classification schemes. In these\nlimits the model predicts universal, parameter-free limiting forms for growth\ninhibition curves. The model also leads to non-trivial predictions for the drug\nsusceptibility of a translation-mutant strain of E. coli, which we verify\nexperimentally.

In the current work,\nwe focus on the Notch/Delta signaling pathway which is not only known to\ntrigger such waves but also is used to achieve the principle of lateral\ninhibition, i.e. a competition for exclusive fates through cross-signaling\nbetween neighboring cells. Such a process ensures unambiguous stochastic\ndecisions influenced by intrinsic noise sources, e.g.~as ones found in the\nregulation of signaling pathways, and extrinsic stochastic fluctuations,\nattributed to micro-environmental factors. However, the effect of intrinsic and\nextrinsic noise on cell fate determination is an open problem.

In particular, these complex and dynamic\nenvironments may be poorly represented by standard experimental and theoretical\nmodels. In this work, we study the performance of various chemotactic\nstrategies under a range of stochastic time- and space-varying attractant\ndistributions in silico. We describe a novel type of response in which the\nbacterium tumbles more when attractant concentration is increasing, in contrast\nto the response of E. coli, and demonstrate how this response explains the\nbehavior of aerobically-grown Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In this \"speculator\"\nresponse, bacteria compare the current attractant concentration to the\nlong-term average. By tumbling persistently when the current concentration is\nhigher than the average, bacteria maintain their position in regions of high\nattractant concentration. If the current concentration is lower than the\naverage, or is declining, bacteria swim away in search of more favorable\nconditions. When the attractant distribution is spatially complex but\nslowly-changing, this response is as effective as that of E. coli.\n",

One canonical cell-fate decision that\ncancer cells undergo is Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its\nreverse Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET). While transitioning between\nthese two phenotypes - epithelial and mesenchymal - cells can also attain a\nhybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (i.e. partial or intermediate EMT) phenotype.\nCells in this phenotype have mixed epithelial (e.g. adhesion) and mesenchymal\n(e.g. migration) properties, thereby allowing them to move collectively as\nclusters of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). If these clusters enter the\ncirculation, they can be more apoptosis-resistant and more capable of\ninitiating metastatic lesions than cancer cells moving individually with wholly\nmesenchymal phenotypes, having undergo a complete EMT. Here, we review the\noperating principles of the core regulatory network for EMT/MET that acts as a\nthree-way switch giving rise to three distinct phenotypes - epithelial,\nmesenchymal and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal. We further characterize this\nhybrid E/M phenotype in terms of its capabilities in terms of collective cell\nmigration, tumor-initiation, cell-cell communication, and drug resistance. We\nelucidate how the highly interconnected coupling between these modules\ncoordinates cell-fate decisions among a population of cancer cells in the\ndynamic tumor, hence facilitating tumor-stoma interactions, formation of CTC\nclusters, and consequently cancer metastasis.

To address this question, we studied tip cell overtaking\nin two existing cellular Potts models of angiogenic sprouting. In these models\nangiogenic sprouting-like behavior emerges from a small set of plausible cell\nbehaviors and the endothelial cells spontaneously migrate forwards and\nbackwards within sprouts, suggesting that tip cell overtaking might occur as a\nside effect of sprouting. In accordance with experimental observations, in our\nsimulations the cells' tendency to occupy the tip position can be regulated\nwhen two cell lines with different levels of Vegfr2 expression are contributing\nto sprouting (mosaic sprouting assay), where cell behavior is regulated by a\nsimple VEGF-Dll4-Notch signaling network. Our modeling results suggest that tip\ncell overtaking occurs spontaneously due to the stochastic motion of cells\nduring sprouting.

In rich nutrient conditions, cells\ndivide much faster than their chromosomes replicate. This implies that cells\nmaintain multiple rounds of chromosome replication per cell division by\nregulating the timing of chromosome replications. Here, we show that both cell\nsize and chromosome replication may be simultaneously regulated by the\nlong-standing initiator accumulation strategy. The strategy proposes that\ninitiators are produced in proportion to the volume increase and is accumulated\nat each origin of replication, and chromosome replication is initiated when a\ncritical amount per origin has accumulated. We show that this model maps to the\nincremental model of size control, which was previously shown to reproduce\nexperimentally observed correlations between various events in the cell cycle\nand explains the exponential dependence of cell size on the growth rate of the\ncell. Furthermore, we show that this model also leads to the efficient\nregulation of the timing of initiation and the number of origins consistent\nwith existing experimental results.\n",

The major\nfeatures of cell cycle and proliferation, cell damage and repair, and chemical\ndiffusion are included. Cell evolution is based on a discrete Markov chain,\nwith cells stepping along a sequence of discrete internal states from 'normal'\nto 'inactive'. Probabilistic laws are introduced for each type of event a cell\ncan undergo during its life cycle: duplication, arrest, apoptosis, senescence,\ndamage, healing. We adjust the model parameters on a series of cell irradiation\nexperiments, carried out in a clinical LINAC at 20 MV, in which the damage and\nrepair kinetics of single- and double-strand breaks are followed. Two showcase\napplications of the model are then presented. In the first one, we reconstruct\nthe cell survival curves from a number of published low- and high-dose\nirradiation experiments. We reobtain a very good description of the data\nwithout assuming the well-known linear-quadratic model, but instead including a\nvariable DSB repair probability, which is found to spontaneously saturate with\nan exponential decay at increasingly high doses. As a second test, we attempt\nto simulate the two extreme possibilities of the so-called 'bystander' effect\nin radiotherapy: the 'local' effect versus a 'global' effect, respectively\nactivated by the short-range or long-range diffusion of some factor, presumably\nsecreted by the irradiated cells.

Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to\ndominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the\navailable substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of\nsets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical\nbackbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by\norganisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the\nstability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be\nreshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this\npaper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary\nselection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics\nbecome predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence\nlarge reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic\ninstabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple\nmathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a\nstatistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable\ndynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict\nevolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell\ndifferentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here\nis that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how\nto differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation. For\nexample, in this framework we can predict that regulatory systems will\nevolutionary favor networks where the number of catalytic enhancers is not\nlarger than the number of suppressors.\n",

We are the first to show that\nexosomes derived from poly(I:C) stimulated cells induce in vivo macrophage\nM1-like polarization within murine lymph nodes. These TLR-exosomes demonstrate\nenhanced trafficking to the node and preferentially recruit neutrophils as\ncompared to control-exosomes. This work definitively establishes the\ndifferential effector function for TLR-exosomes in communicating the activation\nstate of the cell of origin.\n",

        "summary": "  A central question in developmental biology is how size and position are\ndetermined. The genetic code carries instructions on how to control these\nproperties in order to regulate the pattern and morphology of structures in the\ndeveloping organism. Transcription and protein translation mechanisms implement\nthese instructions. However, this cannot happen without some manner of sampling\nof epigenetic information on the current patterns and morphological forms of\nstructures in the organism. Any rigorous description of space- and time-varying\npatterns and morphological forms reduces to one among various classes of\nspatio-temporal partial differential equations. Reaction-transport equations\nrepresent one such class. Starting from simple Fickian diffusion, the\nincorporation of reaction, phase segregation and advection terms can represent\nmany of the patterns seen in the animal and plant kingdoms. Morphological form,\nrequiring the development of three-dimensional structure, also can be\nrepresented by these equations of mass transport, albeit to a limited degree.\nThe recognition that physical forces play controlling roles in shaping tissues\nleads to the conclusion that (nonlinear) elasticity governs the development of\nmorphological form. In this setting, inhomogeneous growth drives the elasticity\nproblem. The combination of reaction-transport equations with those of\nelasto-growth makes accessible a potentially unlimited spectrum of patterning\nand morphogenetic phenomena in developmental biology. This perspective\ncommunication is a survey of the partial differential equations of mathematical\nphysics that have been proposed to govern patterning and morphogenesis in\ndevelopmental biology. Several numerical examples are included to illustrate\nthese equations and the corresponding physics, with the intention of providing\nphysical insight wherever possible.\n",

This facilitates stress adaptation and the mode of action involves\nactivation of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor leading to the\nmodulation of target gene expression. However, this genomic effect is slow\nacting and, therefore, a role for glucocorticoid in the rapid response to\nstress is unclear. Here we show that stress levels of cortisol, the primary\nglucocorticoid in teleosts, rapidly fluidizes rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus\nmykiss) liver plasma membranes in vitro. This involved incorporation of the\nsteroid into the lipid domains, as cortisol coupled to a membrane impermeable\npeptide moiety, did not affect membrane order. Studies confirmed that cortisol,\nbut not sex steroids, increases liver plasma membrane fluidity. Atomic force\nmicroscopy revealed cortisol mediated changes to membrane surface topography\nand viscoelasticity confirming changes to membrane order. Treating trout\nhepatocytes with stress levels of cortisol led to the modulation of cell\nsignaling pathways, including the phosphorylation status of putative PKA, PKC\nand AKT substrate proteins within 10 minutes. The phosphorylation by protein\nkinases in the presence of cortisol was consistent with that seen with benzyl\nalcohol, a known membrane fluidizer. Our results suggest that biophysical\nchanges to plasma membrane properties, triggered by stressor induced\nglucocorticoid elevation, act as a nonspecific stress response and may rapidly\nmodulate acute stress-signaling pathways.\n",

In this experiment, mice were infected with\ninfluenza virus carrying a green fluorescent protein reporter gene, and the\nproportion of lung epithelial cells that were influenza infected was measured\nas a function of time. Three inoculum dose groups - 10^4 PFU, 10^6 PFU and 10^7\nPFU - were used.

How such balanced growth is\nachieved, however, is not a trivial question, because this kind of growth\nrequires orchestrated replication of the components in stochastic and nonlinear\ncatalytic reactions. By considering a mutually catalyzing reaction in two- and\nthree-dimensional lattices, as represented by a cellular automaton model, we\nshow that self-reproduction with exponential growth is possible only when the\nreplication and degradation of one molecular species is much slower than those\nof the others, i.e., when there is a minority molecule. Here, the synergetic\neffect of molecular discreteness and crowding is necessary to produce the\nexponential growth. Otherwise, the growth curves show superexponential growth\nbecause of nonlinearity of the catalytic reactions or subexponential growth due\nto replication inhibition by overcrowding of molecules.

As a\nresult, the impact of different types of an environment is accounted for the\ndynamics of patterns formation.

ALL occurs\nmostly in children and CLL occurs mainly in old people. However, the\nPhiladelphia-chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+-ALL) and the Ph-like ALL occur in\nboth children and adults. To understand childhood leukemia/lymphoma, we have\nrecently proposed two hypotheses on the causes and the mechanism of cell\ntransformation of a LC. Hypothesis A is: repeated bone-remodeling during\nbone-growth and bone-repair may be a source of cell injuries of marrow cells\nincluding hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), myeloid cells, and LCs. Hypothesis B\nis: a LC may have three pathways on transformation: a slow, a rapid, and an\naccelerated. We discuss in the present paper the developing mechanisms of ALL\nand CLL by these hypotheses. Having a peak incidence in young children, ALL may\ndevelop mainly as a result of rapid cell transformation of a lymphoblast (or\npro-lymphocyte). Differently, Ph+-ALL and Ph-like ALL may develop as results of\ntransformation of a lymphoblast via accelerated pathway.

        "summary": "  Lymphomas are a large group of neoplasms developed from lymphoid cells (LCs)\nin lymph nodes (LNs) or lymphoid tissues (LTs). Some forms of lymphomas,\nincluding Burkitt lymphoma (BL), ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma\n(ALK+-ALCL), and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL), occur mainly\nin children and teenagers. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has a peak incidence at age\n20s. To understand pediatric lymphoma, we have recently proposed two hypotheses\non the causes and the mechanism of cell transformation of a LC. Hypothesis A\nis: repeated bone-remodeling during bone-growth and bone-repair may be a source\nof cell injuries of marrow cells including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),\nmyeloid cells, and LCs, and thymic involution may be a source of damage to the\ndeveloping T-cells in thymus. Hypothesis B is: a LC may have three pathways on\ntransformation: a slow, a rapid, and an accelerated. In this paper, we discuss\npediatric lymphomas by this hypothesis. Having a peak incidence at young age,\nBL, T-LBL, ALK+-ALCL, and HL develop more likely as a result of rapid\ntransformation of a LC. In BL, ALK+-ALCL, and HL, the cell transformations may\nbe triggered by severe viral infections. In T-LBL, the cell transformation may\nbe related to thymic involution. Occurring in both adults and children, diffuse\nlarge B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) may develop via slow or accelerated pathway. In\nconclusion, pediatric lymphoma may develop as a result of \"one-step\" cell\ntransformation of a LC, and severe viral infections may be the main trigger for\nthe rapid transformation of a LC in a LN/LT.\n",

To understand why AML and\nCML occurin children, we analyzed the causes and the mechanism of cell\ntransformation of a MC. I. Forthe MCs in marrow cavity, repeated\nbone-remodeling during bone-growth may be a source ofcell injuries. II. As a\ntype of blood cell, a MC may have higher survivability from DNAchanges and\nrequire obtaining fewer cancerous properties for cell transformation than a\ntissuecell. III. Point DNA mutations (PDMs) and chromosome changes (CCs) are\nthe two majortypes of DNA changes. CCs have three subtypes by effects on a\ncell: great effect CCs(GECCs), mild-effect CCs (MECCs), and intermediate-effect\nCCs (IECCs). A GECC affectsone or more genes and can alone trigger cell\ntransformation. PDMs/MECCs are mostly mildand can accumulate in cells. Some of\nthe PDMs/MECCs contribute to cell transformation. AnIECC affects one or more\ngenes and participates in cell transformation. IV. Based on II andIII, we\nhypothesize that a MC may have two pathways on transformation: a slow and\nanaccelerated. Slow pathway is driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs.\nAccelerated pathwayis driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs/IECC(s). A\ntransformation via slow pathwayoccurs at old age; whereas that via accelerated\npathway occurs at any age. Thus, CML andpediatric AML may develop via\naccelerated pathway, and adult AML may develop via bothpathways. In conclusion,\npediatric AML and CML may develop as a result of transformationof a MC via\naccelerated pathway; and repeated bone-remodeling for bone-growth may be\natrigger for the transformation of a MC in a child.\n",

This material is highly thrombogenic, and plaque rupture can lead\nto the formation of blood clots that occlude major arteries and cause\nmyocardial infarction or stroke. In advanced plaques, vascular smooth muscle\ncells (SMCs) migrate from deeper in the artery wall to synthesise a cap of\nfibrous tissue that stabilises the plaque and sequesters the thrombogenic\nplaque content from the bloodstream. The fibrous cap provides crucial\nprotection against the clinical consequences of atherosclerosis, but the\nmechanisms of cap formation are poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear\nwhy certain plaques become stable and robust while others become fragile and\nvulnerable to rupture.\n  We develop a multiphase model with non-standard boundary conditions to\ninvestigate early fibrous cap formation in the atherosclerotic plaque. The\nmodel is parameterised using a range of in vitro and in vivo data, and includes\nhighly nonlinear mechanisms of SMC proliferation and migration in response to\nan endothelium-derived chemical signal. We demonstrate that the model SMC\npopulation naturally evolves towards a steady-state, and predict a rate of cap\nformation and a final plaque SMC content consistent with experimental\nobservations in mice. Parameter sensitivity simulations show that SMC\nproliferation makes a limited contribution to cap formation, and highlight that\nstable cap formation relies on a critical balance between SMC recruitment to\nthe plaque, SMC migration within the plaque and SMC loss by apoptosis. The\nmodel represents the first detailed in silico study of fibrous cap formation in\natherosclerosis, and establishes a multiphase modelling framework that can be\nreadily extended to investigate many other aspects of plaque development.\n",

This is a regulatory process\nthrough which epithelial cells (ECs) acquire mesenchymal characteristics and\ntransform to mesenchymal-like cells (MCs). In this paper, we present a new\nmathematical model which describes the transition from a collective invasion\nstrategy for the ECs to an individual invasion strategy for the MCs. We achieve\nthis by formulating a coupled hybrid system consisting of partial and\nstochastic differential equations that describe the evolution of the ECs and\nthe MCs, respectively. This approach allows one to reproduce in a very natural\nway fundamental qualitative features of the current biomedical understanding of\ncancer invasion that are not easily captured by classical modelling approaches,\nfor example, the invasion of the ECM by self-generated gradients and the\nappearance of EC invasion islands outside of the main body of the tumour.\n",

In addition\nto reporting the blood clot yield stresses, we also show that the thrombus\n'core' does not experience significant deformation, while its 'shell' does.\nThis indicates that the latter is more prone to embolization. Hence, drugs\nshould be designed to target the shell selectively, while leaving the core\nintact (to minimize excessive bleeding). Finally, we laid down a foundation for\na nondimensionalization procedure, which unraveled a relationship between clot\nmechanics and biology.

Cell-based models represent individual\ncells as single particles or as sets of interconnected particles, and predict\nthe collective cell behavior that follows from a set of interaction rules. In\nparticular, vertex-based models are a popular tool for studying the mechanics\nof confluent, epithelial cell layers. They represent the junctions between\nthree (or sometimes more) cells in confluent tissues as point particles,\nconnected using structural elements that represent the cell boundaries. A\ndisadvantage of these models is that cell-cell interfaces are represented as\nstraight lines. This is a suitable simplification for epithelial tissues, where\nthe interfaces are typically under tension, but this simplification may not be\nappropriate for mesenchymal tissues or tissues that are under compression, such\nthat the cell-cell boundaries can buckle. In this paper we introduce a variant\nof VMs in which this and two other limitations of VMs have been resolved. The\nnew model can also be seen as on off-the-lattice generalization of the Cellular\nPotts Model. It is an extension of the open-source package VirtualLeaf, which\nwas initially developed to simulate plant tissue morphogenesis where cells do\nnot move relative to one another. The present extension of VirtualLeaf\nintroduces a new rule for cell-cell shear or sliding, from which T1 and T2\ntransitions emerge naturally, allowing application of VirtualLeaf to problems\nof animal development.

The number of molecules\nobserved at each randomly-distributed bacterium is first derived by\ncharacterizing the diffusion and degradation of signaling molecules within the\npopulation.

However, the study of tissue-scale mechanics is impaired by the\ndifficulty of direct measurement of stress in-vivo. Alternative, image-based\ninference schemes aim to estimate stress from snapshots of cellular geometry\nbut are challenged by sensitivity to fluctuations and measurement noise as well\nas the dependence on boundary conditions. Here we overcome these difficulties\nby introducing a new variational approach - the Geometrical Variation Method\n(GVM) - which exploits the fundamental duality between stress and cellular\ngeometry that exists in the state of mechanical equilibrium of discrete\nmechanical networks that approximate cellular tissues. In the Geometrical\nVariation Method, the two dimensional apical geometry of an epithelial tissue\nis approximated by a 2D tiling with Circular Arc Polygons (CAP) in which the\narcs represent intercellular interfaces defined by the balance of local line\ntension and pressure differentials between adjacent cells. We take advantage of\nlocal constraints that mechanical equilibrium imposes on CAP geometry to define\na variational procedure that extracts the best fitting equilibrium\nconfiguration from images of epithelial monolayers. The GVM-based stress\ninference algorithm has been validated by the comparison of the predicted\ncellular and mesoscopic scale stress and measured myosin II patterns in the\nepithelial tissue during Drosophila embryogenesis. GVM prediction of mesoscopic\nstress tensor correlates at the 80% level with the measured myosin distribution\nand reveals that most of the myosin II activity is involved in a static\ninternal force balance within the epithelial layer. Lastly, this study provides\na practical method for non-destructive estimation of stress in live epithelial\ntissues.\n",

Its functions are mediated through G protein dependent\nand independent signaling pathways. AT1R has several endogenous peptidic\nagonists, all derived from angiotensinogen, as well as several synthetic\nligands known to elicit biased signaling responses. Here, surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR) was used as a cell- based and label-free technique to quantify,\nin real time, the response of HEK293 cells stably expressing the human AT1R.\nThe goal was to take advantage of the integrative nature of this assay to\nidentify specific signaling pathways in the features of the response profiles\ngenerated by numerous endogenous and synthetic ligands of AT1R. First, we\nassessed the contributions of Gq, G12/13, Gi, Gbg, ERK1/2 and \\b{eta}-\narrestins pathways in the cellular responses measured by SPR where Gq,\nG12/Rho/ROCK together with \\b{eta}-arrestins and ERK1/2 were found to play\nsignificant roles. More specifically, we established a major role for G12 in\nthe early events of the AT1R-dependent response, which was followed by a robust\nERK1/2 component associated to the later phase of the signal.

This model has been simplified into two compartments: lymph node\nand peripheral blood. The model includes CD4 T-lymphocytes in several states\n(quiescent Q, naive N and activated T), cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, B-cells and\ndendritic cells. Cytokines and immunoglobulins specific for each antigen (i.e.\ngp41 or p24) have been also included in the model, modelling the atraction\neffect of CD4 T-cells to the infected area and the reduction of virus\nconcentration by immunoglobulins. HIV virus infection of CD4 T-lymphocytes is\nmodelled in several stages: before fusion as HIV-attached (H) and after fusion\nas non-permissive / abortively infected (M), and permissive / latently infected\n(L) and permissive / actively infected (I). These equations have been\nimplemented in a C++/Python interface application, called Immune System app,\nwhich runs Open Modelica software to solve the ODE system through a 4th order\nRunge-Kutta numerical approximation. Results of the simulation show that\nalthough HIV virus concentration in both compartments is lower than $10^{-10}$\nvirus/$\\mu L$ after t=2 years, quiescent lymphocytes reach an equilibrium with\na concentration lower than the initial conditions, due to the latency state,\nwhich serves as a reservoir in time of virus production. As a conclusion, this\nmodel can provide reliable results in other conditions, such as antiviral\ntherapies.\n",

This issue is compounded by a severe lack of\nnew antibiotics reaching the market. The significant rise in clinical\nresistance to antibiotics is especially problematic in nosocomial infections,\nwhere already vulnerable patients may fail to respond to treatment, causing\neven greater health concern. A recent focus has been on the development of\nanti-virulence drugs as a second line of defence in the treatment of\nantibiotic-resistant infections. This treatment, which weakens bacteria by\nreducing their virulence rather than killing them, should allow infections to\nbe cleared through the body's natural defence mechanisms. In this way there\nshould be little to no selective pressure exerted on the organism and, as such,\na predominantly resistant population would be unlikely to emerge. However, much\ncontroversy surrounds this approach with many believing it would not be\npowerful enough to clear existing infections, restricting its potential\napplication to prophylaxis. We have developed a mathematical model that\nprovides a theoretical framework to reveal the circumstances under which\nanti-virulence drugs may or may not be successful. We demonstrate that by\nharnessing and combining the advantages of antibiotics with those provided by\nanti-virulence drugs, given infection-specific parameters, it is possible to\nidentify treatment strategies that would efficiently clear bacterial\ninfections, while preventing the emergence of resistant subpopulations.

However, there is still much uncertainty about how to\ndefine the reference mechanical state at which bone structure is adapted and\nstable. Clinical and experimental observations show that this reference state\nvaries both in space and in time, over a wide range of timescales. We propose\nan osteocyte-based mechanostat theory that links various timescales of\nstructural adaptation with various dynamic features of the osteocyte network in\nbone. This theory assumes that osteocytes are formed adapted to their current\nlocal mechanical environment through modulation of morphological and genotypic\nosteocyte properties involved in mechanical sensitivity. We distinguish two\nmain types of physiological responses by which osteocytes subsequently modify\nthe reference mechanical state. One is the replacement of osteocytes during\nbone remodelling, which occurs over the long timescales of bone turnover. The\nother is cell desensitisation responses, which occur more rapidly and\nreversibly during an osteocyte's lifetime. The novelty of this theory is to\npropose that long-lasting morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties\nprovide a material basis for a long-term mechanical memory of bone that is\ngradually reset by bone remodelling. We test this theory by simulating\nlong-term mechanical disuse (modelling spinal cord injury), and short-term\nmechanical loadings (modelling daily exercises) with a mathematical model. The\nconsideration of osteocyte desensitisation and of osteocyte replacement by\nremodelling is able to capture the different phenomena and timescales observed\nduring the mechanical adaptation of bone tissues, lending support to this\ntheory.\n",

EMT can also be co-opted by cancer cells to\nacquire metastatic potential and drug-resistance. Recent research has argued\nthat epithelial (E) cells can undergo either a partial EMT to attain a hybrid\nepithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that typically displays collective\nmigration, or a complete EMT to adopt a mesenchymal (M) phenotype that shows\nindividual migration. The core EMT regulatory network -\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 - has been identified by various studies, but how\nthis network regulates the transitions among the E, E/M, and M phenotypes\nremains controversial. Two major mathematical models - ternary chimera switch\n(TCS) and cascading bistable switches (CBS) - that both focus on the\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 network, have been proposed to elucidate the EMT\ndynamics, but a detailed analysis of how well either or both of these two\nmodels can capture recent experimental observations about EMT dynamics remains\nto be done. Results: Here, via an integrated experimental and theoretical\napproach, we first show that both these two models can be used to understand\nthe two-step transition of EMT - E-E/M-M, the different responses of SNAIL and\nZEB1 to exogenous TGF-b and the irreversibility of complete EMT. Next, we\npresent new experimental results that tend to discriminate between these two\nmodels. We show that ZEB1 is present at intermediate levels in the hybrid E/M\nH1975 cells, and that in HMLE cells, overexpression of SNAIL is not sufficient\nto initiate EMT in the absence of ZEB1 and FOXC2. Conclusions: These\nexperimental results argue in favor of the TCS model proposing that\nmiR-200/ZEB1 behaves as a three-way decision-making switch enabling transitions\namong the E, hybrid E/M and M phenotypes.\n",

We use fluorescence microscopy to image neurons,\nquantify their dynamics, and demonstrate that the substrate geometrical\npatterns cause strong directional alignment of axons. We quantify axonal growth\nand report a general stochastic approach that quantitatively describes the\nmotion of growth cones. The growth cone dynamics is described by Langevin and\nFokker-Planck equations with both deterministic and stochastic contributions.\nWe show that the deterministic terms contain both the angular and speed\ndependence of axonal growth, and that these two contributions can be separated.\nGrowth alignment is determined by surface geometry, and it is quantified by the\ndeterministic part of the Langevin equation. We combine experimental data with\ntheoretical analysis to measure the key parameters of the growth cone motion:\nspeed and angular distributions, correlation functions, diffusion coefficients,\ncharacteristics speeds and damping coefficients. We demonstrate that axonal\ndynamics displays a cross-over from Brownian motion (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess) at earlier times to anomalous dynamics (superdiffusion) at later\ntimes.

According to this model,\nsomitogenesis is based upon the interaction between a genetic oscillator, known\nas segmentation clock, and a differentiation wavefront, which provides the\npositional information indicating where each pair of somites is formed. Shortly\nafter the clock and wavefront paradigm was introduced, Meinhardt presented a\nconceptually different mathematical model for morphogenesis in general, and\nsomitogenesis in particular. Recently, Cotterell et al. rediscovered an\nequivalent model by systematically enumerating and studying small networks\nperforming segmentation. Cotterell et al. called it a progressive oscillatory\nreaction-diffusion (PORD) model. In the Meinhardt- PORD model, somitogenesis is\ndriven by short-range interactions and the posterior movement of the front is a\nlocal, emergent phenomenon, which is not controlled by global positional\ninformation. With this model, it is possible to explain some experimental\nobservations that are incompatible with the clock and wavefront model. However\nthe Meinhardt-PORD model has some important disadvantages of its own. Namely,\nit is quite sensitive to fluctuations and depends on very specific initial\nconditions (which are not biologically realistic). In this work, we propose an\nequivalent Meinhardt-PORD model, and then amend it to couple it with a\nwavefront consisting of a receding morphogen gradient. By doing so, we get a\nhybrid model between the Meinhardt-PORD and the clock-and-wavefront ones, which\novercomes most of the deficiencies of the two originating models.\n",

Recent advances in inducible genetic\nlabeling provided ample evidence that symmetric stem cell divisions play an\nimportant role in adult mammalian homeostasis. It is well understood that the\ntwo types of cell divisions differ in terms of the stem cells' flexibility to\nexpand when needed. On the contrary, the implications of symmetric and\nasymmetric divisions for mutation accumulation are still poorly understood. In\nthis paper we study a stochastic model of a renewing tissue, and address the\noptimization problem of tissue architecture in the context of mutant\nproduction. Specifically, we study the process of tumor suppressor gene\ninactivation which usually takes place as a sequence of two consecutive \"hits\",\nand which is one of the most common patterns in carcinogenesis. We compare and\ncontrast symmetric and asymmetric (and mixed) stem cell divisions, and focus on\nthe rate at which double-hit mutants are generated. It turns out that\nsymmetrically-dividing cells generate such mutants at a rate which is\nsignificantly lower than that of asymmetrically-dividing cells. This result\nholds whether single-hit (intermediate) mutants are disadvantageous, neutral,\nor advantageous. It is also independent on whether the carcinogenic double-hit\nmutants are produced only among the stem cells or also among more\ndifferentiated cells. We argue that symmetric stem cell divisions in mammals\ncould be an adaptation which helps delay the onset of cancers. We further\ninvestigate the question of the optimal fraction of stem cells in the tissue,\nand quantify the contribution of non-stem cells in mutant production. Our work\nprovides a hypothesis to explain the observation that in mammalian cells,\nsymmetric patterns of stem cell division seem to be very common.\n",

A higher signal to noise ratio is achieved by a\ncooperative action of Ca release channels such as IP3 receptors or ryanodine\nreceptors arranged in clusters or release units containing a few to several\nhundred release channels. The release channels synchronize their openings via\nCa-induced-Ca-release, generating high-amplitude local Ca signals known as\npuffs in neurons or sparks in muscle cells. Despite the high release amplitude\nand positive feedback nature of the activation, Ca signals are strictly\nconfined in time and space by an unexplained termination mechanism. Here we\nshow that the collective transition of release channels from an open to a\nclosed state is identical to the phase transition associated with the reversal\nof magnetic field in an Ising ferromagnet. We demonstrate this mechanism using\nnumerical model simulations of Ca sparks over a wide range of cluster sizes\nfrom 25 to 169 release channels. While prior studies suggested contributions of\nstochastic attrition and Ca store depletion, our new simple quantitative\ncriterion closely predicts the depletion level required for spark termination\nfor each cluster size. We further formulate exact requirements for a cluster of\nrelease channels to follow the Ising model in any cell type. Thus we describe\ndeterministically the behaviour of a system on a coarser scale (release unit)\nwhich is random on a finer scale (release channels), bridging the gap between\nscales.

We develop a modeling framework\nfor tumor ablation, and present the simplest possible model for drug diffusion\nin a spherical tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually\nleads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities\nnumerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends\non both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the\ncell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug\nconcentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for\na cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The\nconcentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us\nto compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at\nmuch finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to\nproduce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture\nof the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,\nleak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different\nindividuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through\nbootstrapping to simulate error.

        "summary": "  Cell proliferation is typically incorporated into stochastic mathematical\nmodels of cell migration by assuming that cell divisions occur after an\nexponentially distributed waiting time. Experimental observations, however,\nshow that this assumption is often far from the real cell cycle time\ndistribution (CCTD). Recent studies have suggested an alternative approach to\nmodelling cell proliferation based on a multi-stage representation of the CCTD.\nIn order to validate and parametrise these models, it is important to connect\nthem to experimentally measurable quantities. In this paper we investigate the\nconnection between the CCTD and the speed of the collective invasion. We first\nstate a result for a general CCTD, which allows the computation of the invasion\nspeed using the Laplace transform of the CCTD. We use this to deduce the range\nof speeds for the general case. We then focus on the more realistic case of\nmulti-stage models, using both a stochastic agent-based model and a set of\nreaction-diffusion equations for the cells' average density. By studying the\ncorresponding travelling wave solutions, we obtain an analytical expression for\nthe speed of invasion for a general N-stage model with identical transition\nrates, in which case the resulting cell cycle times are Erlang distributed. We\nshow that, for a general N-stage model, the Erlang distribution and the\nexponential distribution lead to the minimum and maximum invasion speed,\nrespectively. This result allows us to determine the range of possible invasion\nspeeds in terms of the average proliferation time for any multi-stage model.\n",

Consequently, by means of a specific\nMulti-agent system model, we study the dynamical features emerging from complex\nsocial interactions among individuals belonging to amoeba colonies.\\\\ After\ndefining an appropriate metric to quantitatively estimate the gathering\nprocess, we find that: a) obstacles play the role of local topological\nperturbation, as they alter the flux of chemical signals; b) physical obstacles\n(blocking the cellular motion and the chemical flux) and purely chemical\nobstacles (only interfering with chemical flux) elicit similar dynamical\nbehaviors; c) a minimal program for robustly gathering simulated cells does not\ninvolve mechanisms for obstacle sensing and avoidance; d) fluctuations of the\ndynamics concur in preventing multiple stable clusters.

The\nbiologically and medically vital process of a cell assuming a functionally\nimportant fate from a range of phenotypic possibilities can be thought of as a\ncell decision. To make these decisions, a cell relies on energy dependent\npathways of signalling and expression. However, energy availability is often\noverlooked as a modulator of cellular decision-making. As cells can vary\ndramatically in energy availability, this limits our knowledge of how this key\nbiological axis affects cell behaviour. Here, we consider the energy dependence\nof a highly generalisable decision-making regulatory network, and show that\nenergy variability changes the sets of decisions a cell can make and the ease\nwith which they can be made. Increasing intracellular energy levels can\nincrease the number of stable phenotypes it can generate, corresponding to\nincreased decision-making capacity. For this decision-making architecture, a\ncell with intracellular energy below a threshold is limited to a singular\nphenotype, potentially forcing the adoption of a specific cell fate. We suggest\nthat common energetic differences between cells may explain some of the\nobserved variability in cellular decision-making, and demonstrate the\nimportance of considering energy levels in several diverse biological\ndecision-making phenomena.\n",

With a suitable choice of parameters, our\nmodel is able to reproduce the oscillatory behavior of the Wnt, Notch and FGF\nsignaling pathways in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells.

Notably: the\noscillations increase their amplitude as cells approach the anterior PSM and\nremain in an upregulated state when arrested; the transition from the\noscillatory regime to the upregulated state exhibits hysteresis; and an\nopposing distribution of the Fgf8 and RA gradients in the PSM arises naturally\nin our simulations. We hypothesize that the interaction between a limit cycle\n(originated by the Notch delayed-negative feedback loop) and a bistable switch\n(originated by the Wnt-Notch positive cross-regulation) is responsible for the\nobserved segmentation patterning.

Mechanical forces can\nsynchronize collections of flagella to beat at a common frequency, despite\nactive motor noise that tends to randomize flagellar synchrony. In Chapter 2,\nwe present a new physical mechanism for flagellar synchronization by mechanical\nself-stabilization that applies to free-swimming flagellated cells. This new\nmechanism is independent of direct hydrodynamic interactions between flagella.\nComparison with experimental data provided by experimental collaboration\npartners in the laboratory of J. Howard (Yale, New Haven) confirmed our new\nmechanism in the model organism of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas.\nFurther, we characterize the beating flagellum as a noisy oscillator. Using a\nminimal model of collective motor dynamics, we argue that measured\nnon-equilibrium fluctuations of the flagellar beat result from stochastic motor\ndynamics at the molecular scale. Noise and mechanical coupling are antagonists\n...\n",

When IAV advection and\ndiffusion are both considered, the former is found to dominate infection\nkinetics, and a 10-fold increase in the virus production rate is required to\ncounter its effects. The MM predicts that advection prevents infection from\ndisseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Because virus is\nentrained upwards, the upper HRT sees the most virus, whereas the lower HRT\nsees far less. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than\nin the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the\nupper towards the lower HRT. When the spatial MM is expanded to include\ncellular regeneration and an immune response, it can capture the time course of\ninfection with a seasonal and an avian IAV strain by shifting parameters in a\nmanner consistent with what is expected to differ between these two types of\ninfection. The impact of antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors was\nalso investigated.

        "summary": "  Experiments have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in vitro\ndisseminate both distally via the release and diffusion of cell-free virus\nthrough the medium, and locally via direct, cell-to-cell transmission. To\ndetermine the relative contribution of each mode of infection to HCV\ndissemination, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that explicitly\nincorporates both distal and local modes of infection. The ABM tracks the\nconcentration of extracellular infectious virus in the supernatant and the\nnumber of intracellular HCV RNA segments within each infected cell over the\ncourse of simulated in vitro HCV infections. Experimental data for in vitro HCV\ninfections conducted in the presence and absence of free-virus neutralizing\nantibodies was used to validate the ABM and constrain the value of its\nparameters. We found that direct, cell-to-cell infection accounts for 99%\n(84%$-$100%, 95% credible interval) of infection events, making it the dominant\nmode of HCV dissemination in vitro. Yet, when infection via the free-virus\nroute is blocked, a 57% reduction in the number of infection events at 72 hpi\nis observed experimentally; a result consistent with that found by our ABM.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that while HCV spread via cell-free\nvirus contributes little to the total number of infection events in vitro, it\nplays a critical role in enhancing cell-to-cell HCV dissemination by providing\naccess to distant, uninfected areas, away from the already established large\ninfection foci.\n",

Since 2016 (Berrut et al. 2016) a succession\nof studies (Bois et al. 2019) have traced infant mortality from organisms of\nhigh complexity (e.g. mammals) down to unicellular organisms. Infant mortality\nmay be considered as a filtering process through which organisms with\npotentially lethal congenital defects are eliminated. Such defects may have\nmany causes but here we focus particularly on mishaps resulting from\nnon-optimal conditions in the production of proteins, enzymes and other crucial\nmacromolecules. The statistical signature of infant mortality consists in a\nfalling age-specific death rate. The question we address here is whether infant\nmortality episodes take place in bacteria in the minutes precededing or\nfollowing cell division. It will be shown that while experiments carried out in\nthe 20th century tried but failed to detect such an effect (mostly because of\nlimited sample size), more recent observations provided consistent evidence of\na sizeable mortality, with a rate of the order of 0.7 per 1,000 per hour, in\nthe exponential growth phase of E. coli. A further crucial test will be to\nmeasure the age-specific, post-division death rate. An experiment is outlined\nfor that purpose. It is based on the selection of stained cells through flow\ncytometry and the derivation of their ages at death from their sizes. If an\ninfant mortality effect can be identified in E. coli it can be conjectured that\na similar effect also exists in other unicellular organisms, both prokaryote\nand eukaryote.\n",

To\nname but one application, this acoustic contrast can be exploited using\nacoustophoretic systems to isolate cancer cells from a liquid biopsy, such as a\nblood sample. Knowing the ACF of a cancer cell represents a crucial step in the\ndesign of acoustophoretic systems for this purpose, potentially allowing the\nisolation of circulating cancer cells without labels or contact. For biological\ncells the static compressibility is different from the high frequency\ncounterpart relevant for the ACF. In this study, we started by characterizing\nthe ACF of low vs. high metastatic cell lines with known associated differences\nin phenotypic static E-modulus. The change in the static E-modulus, however,\nwas not reflected in a change of the ACF, prompting a more in depth analysis of\nthe influences on the ACF. We demonstrate that static E-modulus increased\nbiological cells through formaldehyde fixation have an increased ACF.\nConversely static E-modulus decreased biological cells treated with actin\npolymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D have a decreased ACF. Complementing\nthese mechanical tests, a numerical COMSOL model was implemented and used to\nparametrically explore the effects of cell density, cell density ratios,\ndynamic compressibility and therefore the dynamic bulk modulus. Collectively\nthe combined laboratory and numerical experiments reveal that a change in the\nstatic E-modulus alone might, but does not automatically lead to a change of\nthe dynamic ACF for biological cells. This highlights the need for a\nmultiparametic view of the biophysical basis of the cellular ACF, as well as\nthe challenges in harnessing acoustophoretic systems to isolate circulating\ncells based on their mechanical properties alone.\n",

The new model of pathogenesis\n- skin reaction to systemic psoriatic process SPP is formulated. ... Psoriatic\ninflammation is regarded as a reaction of the skin immune system to activity of\nMo-R and DC-R involved in derma from blood flow. They contain Y-antigen and,\ngetting to derma, can be transformed in mature maDC-Y and present this antigen\nto Y-specific T-lymphocytes as well as activate them. Y-antigen is a part of\nthe interpeptide bridge IB-Y. Therefore, the skin immune system can incorrectly\ninterpret Y-antigen presentation as a sign of external PsB-infection and switch\none of mechanisms of protection against bacterial infection - epidermal\nhyperproliferation. Psoriatic plaque can be initiated only during action of\nlocal inflammatory process LP2 in derma causing not only innate, but also\nadaptive response. In particular, it is possible at LP2(IN) - open trauma of\nderma or at LP2(HPV) - HPV-carriage of keratinocytes. The level of Y-priming\n(presence and concentration of Y-specific T-lymphocytes in prepsoriatic derma\nand in lymph nodes) also determines possibility of psoriatic plaque initiation.\nExistence and severity of psoriatic plaque is determined by intensity of\nY-antigen income into derma (inside Mo-R and DC-R). ... Severity of plaque is\naggravated by LP2-inflammation if it persists after this plaque initiation. New\nMo-T, DC-T (incl. Mo-R, DC-R) and Y-specific T-lymphocytes are constantly\nattracted into plaques from blood flow, and so support vicious cycles. Only at\ndecrease of SPP severity, these vicious cycles weaken and natural remission of\nplaques takes place, up to their complete disappearance.

Experimental evidence and analysis of\nlarge-scale microarray data establish the key role played by a two-gene motif\nin cell differentiation in a number of cell systems. The two genes express\ntranscription factors which repress each other's expression and autoactivate\ntheir own production. A number of theoretical models have recently been\nproposed based on the two-gene motif to provide a physical understanding of how\ncell differentiation occurs. In this paper, we study a simple model of cell\ndifferentiation which assumes no cooperativity in the regulation of gene\nexpression by the transcription factors. The latter repress each other's\nactivity directly through DNA binding and indirectly through the formation of\nheterodimers. We specifically investigate how deterministic processes combined\nwith stochasticity contribute in bringing about cell differentiation. The\ndeterministic dynamics of our model give rise to a supercritical pitchfork\nbifurcation from an undifferentiated stable steady state to two differentiated\nstable steady states. The stochastic dynamics of our model are studied using\nthe approaches based on the Langevin equations and the linear noise\napproximation. The simulation results provide a new physical understanding of\nrecent experimental observations. We further propose experimental measurements\nof quantities like the variance and the lag-1 autocorrelation function in\nprotein fluctuations as the early signatures of an approaching bifurcation\npoint in the cell differentiation process.\n",

From movies of neutrophil phagocytosis of polystyrene\nbeads, we measure the fractional engulfment as a function of time and\ndemonstrate that phagocytosis occurs in two distinct stages. During the first\nstage, engulfment is relatively slow and progressively slows down as\nphagocytosis proceeds. However, at approximately half-engulfment, the rate of\nengulfment increases dramatically, with complete engulfment attained soon\nafterwards. By studying simple mathematical models of phagocytosis, we suggest\nthat the first stage is due to a passive mechanism, determined by receptor\ndiffusion and capture, whereas the second stage is more actively controlled,\nperhaps with receptors being driven towards the site of engulfment. We then\nconsider a more advanced model that includes signaling and captures both stages\nof engulfment. This model predicts that there is an optimum ligand density for\nquick engulfment. Further, we show how this model explains why non-spherical\nparticles engulf quickest when presented tip-first. Our findings suggest that\nactive regulation may be a later evolutionary innovation, allowing fast and\nrobust engulfment even for large particles.\n",

Death\nreceptors cluster upon binding to death ligands, leading to formation of a\nmembrane proximal death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC). In this membrane\nproximal signalosome, initiator caspases (caspase 8) are processed resulting in\nactivation of both type 1 and type 2 pathways of apoptosis signaling. How the\ntype 1/type 2 choice is made is an important question in the systems biology of\napoptosis signaling. In this study, we utilize a Monte Carlo based in silico\napproach to elucidate the role of membrane proximal signaling module in the\ntype 1/type 2 choice of apoptosis signaling. Our results provide crucial\nmechanistic insights into the formation of DISC signalosome and caspase 8\nactivation. Increased concentration of death ligands was shown to correlate\nwith increased type 1 activation.

Interest in\nstudying death ligand induced apoptosis has increased due to the promising role\nof recombinant soluble forms of death ligands (mainly recombinant TRAIL) in\nanti-cancer therapy. A clear elucidation of how death ligands activate the type\n1 and type 2 apoptotic pathways in healthy and cancer cells may help develop\nbetter chemotherapeutic strategies. In this work, we use kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations to address the problem of type 1/ type 2 choice in death ligand\nmediated apoptosis of cancer cells. Our study provides insights into the\nactivation of membrane proximal death module that results from complex\ninterplay between death and decoy receptors. Relative abundance of death and\ndecoy receptors was shown to be a key parameter for activation of the initiator\ncaspases in the membrane module. Increased concentration of death ligands\nfrequently increased the type 1 activation fraction in cancer cells, and, in\ncertain cases changes the signaling phenotype from type 2 to type 1. Results of\nthis study also indicate that inherent differences between cancer and healthy\ncells, such as in the membrane module, may allow robust activation of cancer\ncell apoptosis by death ligand induction. At the same time, large cell-to-cell\nvariability through the type 2 pathway was shown to provide protection for\nhealthy cells. Such elucidation of selective activation of apoptosis in cancer\ncells addresses a key question in cancer biology and cancer therapy.\n",

In recent years, there has been growing\ninterest in using deformability-based CTC separation microfilters due to their\nsimplicity and low cost. Most of previous studies in this area are mainly based\non experimental work. Although experimental research provides useful insights\nin designing CTC separation devices, there is still a lack of design guidelines\nbased on fundamental understandings of the cell separation process in the\nfilers. While experimental efforts face challenges especially microfabrication\ndifficulties, we adopt numerical simulation here to study conical-shaped\nmicrofilters using deformability difference between CTCs and blood cells for\nseparation process. We use liquid drop model for modeling a CTC passing through\nsuch microfilters. The accuracy of the model in predicting the pressure\nsignature of the system is validated by comparing with previous experiments.\nPressure-deformability analysis of the cell going through the channel is then\ncarried out in detail in order to better understand how a CTC behaves\nthroughout the filtration process. Different system design criteria such as\nsystem throughput and unclogging of the system are discussed. Specifically,\npressure behavior under different system throughput is analyzed. Regarding the\nunclogging issue, we define pressure ratio as a key parameter representing the\nability to overcome clogging in such CTC separation devices and investigate the\neffect of conical angle on the optimum pressure ratio. Finally, the effect of\nunclogging applied pressure on the system performance is examined.

These kinds of phenomena can be modeled with different frameworks,\ntypically cellular automata or reaction-diffusion systems. A different class of\ndynamical processes involves the correlated movement of agents over space,\nwhich can be mediated through chemotactic movement or minimization of cell-cell\ninteraction energy. A classic example of the latter is given by the formation\nof spatially segregated assemblies when cells display differential adhesion.\nHere we consider a new class of dynamical models, involving cell adhesion among\ntwo stochastically exchangeable cell states as a minimal model capable of\nexhibiting well-defined, ordered spatial patterns. Our results suggest that a\nwhole space of pattern-forming rules is hosted by the combination of physical\ndifferential adhesion and the value of probabilities modulating cell phenotypic\nswitching, showing that Turing-like patterns can be obtained without resorting\nto reaction-diffusion processes. If the model is expanded allowing cells to\nproliferate and die in an environment where diffusible nutrient and toxic waste\nare at play, different phases are observed, characterized by regularly spaced\npatterns. The analysis of the parameter space reveals that certain phases reach\nhigher population levels than other modes of organization. A detailed\nexploration of the mean-field theory is also presented. Finally we let\npopulations of cells with different adhesion matrices compete for reproduction,\nshowing that, in our model, structural organization can improve the fitness of\na given cell population.

The\ncharacteristics described by internal variables usually vary monotonically with\nthe passage of time. A particular difficulty appears when the characteristic\ncurves exhibit different slopes from each other and therefore cross each other\nat certain times. In particular such crossing phenomenon occurs during T-cells\nimmune response when the concentrations of protein expressions depend upon each\nother and also when some global protein (e.g. Interleukin signals) is also\ninvolved which is shared by all T-cells. At these crossing points, the linear\nadvection equation is not possible by using the classical way of hyperbolic\nconservation laws. Therefore, a new Transport Method is introduced in this\narticle which allowed us to find the population density function for such\nprocesses. The newly developed Transport method (TM) is shown to work in the\ncase of crossing and to provide a smooth solution at the crossing points in\ncontrast to the classical PDF techniques.\n",

While gene expression motifs incorporating solely transcriptional\nregulation are well investigated, the dynamics of motifs with dual strategies\nof regulation, i.e., both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation,\nhave not been studied as extensively. In this paper, we probe the dynamics of a\nfour-gene motif with dual strategies of regulation of gene expression. Some of\nthe functional characteristics are compared with those of a two-gene motif, the\ngenetic toggle, employing only transcriptional regulation. Both the motifs\ndefine positive feedback loops with the potential for bistability and\nhysteresis. The four-gene motif, contrary to the genetic toggle, is found to\nexhibit bistability even in the absence of cooperativity in the regulation of\ngene expression. The four-gene motif further exhibits a novel dynamical feature\nin which two regions of monostability with linear threshold response are\nseparated by a region of bistability with digital response.\n  Using the linear noise approximation (LNA), we further show that the\ncoefficient of variation (a measure of noise), associated with the protein\nlevels in the steady state, has a lower magnitude in the case of the four-gene\nmotif as compared to the case of the genetic toggle. We next compare\ntranscriptional with post-transcriptional regulation from an information\ntheoretic perspective. We focus on two gene expression motifs, Motif 1 with\ntranscriptional regulation and Motif 2 with post-transcriptional regulation.\n  We show that amongst the two motifs, Motif 2 has a greater capacity for\ninformation transmission for an extended range of parameter values.\n",

Here, we present a stochastic-mechanical\nmultiscale model of an endothelial cell monolayer and show that the dynamic\nnature of the endothelium leads to spontaneous gap formation, even without\nintervention from the transmigrating cells. These gaps preferentially appear at\nthe vertices between three endothelial cells, as opposed to the border between\ntwo cells.

Interestingly, we find experimentally that\ncancer cells also preferentially extravasate at vertices, even when they first\narrest on borders.

Recent experiments suggest that such replicases can be\nrealized if an RNA polymerase ribozyme is divided into fragments short enough\nto be replicable by the ribozyme and if these fragments self-assemble into a\nfunctional ribozyme. However, the continued self-replication of such replicases\nrequires that the production of every essential fragment be balanced and\nsustained. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate whether and under\nwhat conditions fragmented replicases achieve continued self-replication. We\nfirst show that under a simple batch condition, the replicases fail to display\ncontinued self-replication owing to positive feedback inherent in these\nreplicases. This positive feedback inevitably biases replication toward a\nsubset of fragments, so that the replicases eventually fail to sustain the\nproduction of all essential fragments. We then show that this inherent\ninstability can be resolved by small rates of random content exchange between\nloose compartments (i.e., horizontal transfer). In this case, the balanced\nproduction of all fragments is achieved through negative frequency-dependent\nselection operating in the population dynamics of compartments. This selection\nmechanism arises from an interaction mediated by horizontal transfer between\nintracellular and intercellular symmetry breaking. The horizontal transfer also\nensures the presence of all essential fragments in each compartment, sustaining\nself-replication. Taken together, our results underline compartmentalization\nand horizontal transfer in the origin of the first self-replicating replicases.\n",

In this work, a microfluidic chip is designed and tested\nto replicate in vitro key steps in the metastatic cascade. It comprises two\nchannels, resting on the same plane, connected via an array of rounded pillars\nto form a permeable micro-membrane. One channel acts as a vascular compartment\nand is coated by a fully confluent monolayer of endothelial cells, whereas the\nother channel is filled with a mixture of matrigel and breast cancer cells\n(MDA-MB-231) and reproduces the malignant tissue. The vascular permeability can\nbe finely modulated by inducing pro-inflammatory conditions in the tissue\ncompartment, which transiently opens up the tight junctions of endothelial\ncells. Fresh medium flowing continuously in the vascular compartment is\nsufficient to induce cancer cell intravasation at rates of 8 cells/day with an\naverage velocity of 0.5 um/min. On the other hand, the vascular adhesion and\nextravasation of circulating cancer cells require TNF-a stimulation.\nExtravasation occurs at lower rates with 4 cells/day and an average velocity of\n0.1 um/min. Finally, the same chip is completely filled with matrigel and the\nmigration of cancer cells from one channel to the other is monitored over a\nregion of about 400 um. Invasion rates of 12 cells/day are documented upon\nTNF-a stimulation.

In this framework, a\nstochastic individual-based model of cell movement and proliferation is\ncombined with a reaction-diffusion system for the concentrations of some\nmorphogens. As an illustrative example, we focus on a model in which the\ndynamics of the morphogens are governed by an activator-inhibitor system that\ngives rise to Turing pre-patterns. The cells then interact with morphogens in\ntheir local area through either of two forms of chemically-dependent cell\naction: chemotaxis and chemically-controlled proliferation. We begin by\nconsidering such a hybrid model posed on static spatial domains, and then turn\nto the case of growing domains.

The results from the simulation showed that an optimum value\nfor both the Ca$^{2+}$ activation threshold and time slot of input signals\n$T_b$ is required to achieve optimal computation accuracy, where up to 90\\%\naccuracy for both the AND and OR gates can be achieved with the right\ncombination of values. The reinforced learning platform for the engineered\nastrocytes to create digital logic gates can be used for future\nNeural-Molecular Computing chip, which can revolutionize brain implants that\nare constructed from engineered biological cells.\n",

Here we achieve this by using a probabilistic model and\nshow that the response of a population to the gradient is complex. We find the\nchanges to a phenotype (the steady state switching rate in the absence of\ngradients) affects the average speed of the response as well as the width of\nthe distribution and both must be taken into account to optimise the overall\nresponse of the population in complex environments. This is due to the\nbehaviour of individuals in the 'tails' of the distribution.

However, during the process of metastasis, tumor cells undergo\nepithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that can lead to the loss of\nCK/EpCAM expression. Therefore, it is vital to develop a capturing technique\nindependent of CK/EpCAM expression on the cancer cell. To develop this\ntechnique, it is important to identify common secondary oncogenic markers\noverexpressed on tumor cells before and after EMT. We analyzed the biomarker\nexpression levels in tumor cells, before and after EMT, and found two common\nproteins human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) and epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) whose levels remained unaffected. So, we synthesized\nimmunomagnetic iron nanocubes covalently conjugated with antibodies of Her2 or\nEGFR to capture cancer cells irrespective of the EMT status. The nanocubes\nshowed high specificity (6 to 9 fold) in isolating the cancer cells of interest\nfrom a mixture of cells spiked in serum. We characterized the captured cells\nfor identifying their EMT status.

Here we study the morphodynamics of MDA-MB-231 cells in type I\ncollagen extracellular matrix (ECM). We systematically vary ECM physical\nproperties by tuning collagen concentrations, alignment, and gelation\ntemperatures. We find that morphodynamics of 3D migrating cells are externally\ncontrolled by ECM mechanics and internally modulated by Rho-signaling. We\nemploy machine learning to classify cell shape into four different\nmorphological phenotypes, each corresponding to a distinct migration mode. As a\nresult, we map cell morphodynamics at mesoscale into the temporal evolution of\nmorphological phenotypes. We characterize the mesoscale dynamics including\noccurrence probability, dwell time and transition matrix at varying ECM\nconditions, which demonstrate the complex phenotype landscape and optimal\npathways for phenotype transitions. In light of the mesoscale dynamics, we show\nthat 3D cancer cell motility is a hidden Markov process whereby the step size\ndistributions of cell migration are coupled with simultaneous cell\nmorphodynamics. We also show that morphological phenotype transitions\nfacilitate cancer cells to navigate non-uniform ECM such as traversing the\ninterface between matrices of two distinct microstructures. In conclusion, we\ndemonstrate that 3D migrating cancer cells exhibit rich morphodynamics that is\nregulated by ECM mechanics, Rho-signaling, and is closely related with cell\nmotility.

In addition, we show that the observed positioning of the\nnucleoid at midcell is due to the out-of-equilibrium process of messenger RNA\n(mRNA) synthesis and degradation: mRNAs apply a pressure on both sides of the\nnucleoid, localizing it to midcell. We demonstrate that, as the cell grows, the\nproduction of these mRNAs is responsible for the nucleoid splitting into two\nlobes, and for their well-known positioning to 1/4 and 3/4 positions on the\nlong cell axis. Finally, our model quantitatively accounts for the observed\nexpansion of the nucleoid when the pool of cytoplasmic mRNAs is depleted.\nOverall, our study suggests that steric interactions and out-of-equilibrium\neffects of the TTM are key drivers of the internal spatial organization of\nbacterial cells.\n",

We analytically obtain the\ncritical frequencies of the cell rearrangement events where the decrease of the\npattern amplitude as a result of cell rearrangement is balanced by the increase\nin amplitude due to the Delta-Notch interaction dynamics. Our theoretical\nresults are qualitatively consistent with experimental results, supporting the\nnotion that the heterogeneity of expression patterns is inversely correlated\nwith cell rearrangement \\textit{in vivo}. Our framework, while applied here to\nthe specific case of the Delta-Notch system, is applicable more widely to other\npattern formation mechanisms.\n",

Time delays, motivated by the gene expression process,\ncan also greatly affect the behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems. In this\ndissertation, we explore their effects on Turing pattern mechanisms. By\nincorporating time delays, modelled as both a fixed parameter and as a\ncontinuous distribution, into classical reaction-diffusion systems that exhibit\nTuring instabilities, we investigate the changing behaviour of these systems.\nWe find that an introduction of increasing time delay increases the time taken\nfor spatially inhomogeneous patterns to stabilise, and the two are related\nlinearly. We also present results to show, through a linear stability analysis,\nthat an increasing time delay can act both to expand or shrink the Turing space\nof a certain reaction-diffusion mechanism, depending on the placement of\ntime-delayed terms. Significantly, we find that modelling time delays as a\ncontinuous distribution has a negligible impact on qualitative or quantitative\naspects of the results seen compared with a fixed time delay of the mean of the\ndistribution. These findings serve to highlight the importance of considering\ngene expression time delays when modelling biological patterning events, as\nwell as requiring a complete understanding of the cellular dynamics before\nattempting to apply Turing mechanisms to explain biological phenomena. The\nresults also suggest, at least for the distributions considered in this\ndissertation, that fixed delay and distributed delay models have almost\nidentical dynamics.

Oncolytic virotherapy is a type\nof cancer treatment in which oncolytic viruses are deliberately introduced into\npatients affected with cancers in order for them to infect and destroy cancer\ncells locally or systemically, in a manner analogous to chemotherapy but with a\ngreater degree of selectivity. Multiple studies indicate that oncolytic\nvirotherapy is effective in vitro but in vivo findings remain ambiguous due to\nthe approach's primary limitation: inefficient therapeutic agent delivery to\nits target, which is heavily influenced by the immune system. Here, we propose\novercoming this limitation by exploiting a recent discovery in cancer research:\na carrier cell.

The basic process that\ncontrols the network formation is the growth of an axon from the cell body and\nits extension towards target neurons. Axonal growth is directed by\nenvironmental stimuli that include intercellular interactions, biochemical\ncues, and the mechanical and geometrical properties of the growth substrate.\nDespite significant recent progress, the steering of the growing axon remains\npoorly understood. In this paper, we develop a model of axonal motility, which\nincorporates substrate-geometry sensing. We combine experimental data with\ntheoretical analysis to measure the parameters that describe axonal growth on\nmicropatterned surfaces: diffusion (cell motility) coefficients, speed and\nangular distributions, and cell-substrate interactions. Experiments performed\non neurons treated with inhibitors for microtubules (Taxol) and actin filaments\n(Y-27632) indicate that cytoskeletal dynamics play a critical role in the\nsteering mechanism.

There are many ways that a fully competent infectious\nvirion, having successfully entered a cell, can fail to cause a productive\ninfection, i.e. one that yields infectious virus progeny. Though many discrete,\nstochastic mathematical models (DSMs) have been developed and used to estimate\na virus infection's extinction probability, these typically neglect infection\nfailure post viral entry. The DSM presented herein introduces parameter\n$\\gamma\\in(0,1]$ which corresponds to the probability that a virion's entry\ninto a cell will result in a productive cell infection. We derive an expression\nfor the likelihood of infection extinction in this new DSM, and find that\nprophylactic therapy with an antiviral acting to reduce $\\gamma$ is best at\nincreasing an infection's extinction probability, compared to antivirals acting\non the rates of virus production or virus entry into cells. Using the DSM, we\ninvestigate the difference in the fraction of cells consumed by so-called\nextinct versus established virus infections, and find that this distinction\nbecomes biologically meaningless as the probability of extinction approaches\n100%. We show that infections wherein virus is release by an infected cell as a\nsingle burst, rather than at a constant rate over the cell's infectious\nlifespan, has the same probability of infection extinction, despite previous\nclaims to this effect [Pearson 2011, doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001058].\nInstead, extending previous work by others [Yan 2016,\ndoi:10.1007/s00285-015-0961-5], we show how the assumed distribution for the\nstochastic virus burst size, affects the extinction probability and associated\ncritical antiviral efficacy.\n",

A key component of the inflammatory\nresponse is the interaction between monocyte-derived macrophages and\nextracellular lipid. Although concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\nand high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in the blood are known to affect\nplaque progression, their impact on the lipid load of plaque macrophages\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we develop a lipid-structured mathematical\nmodel to investigate the impact of blood LDL/HDL levels on plaque composition,\nand lipid distribution in plaque macrophages. A reduced subsystem, derived by\nsumming the equations of the full model, describes the dynamics of biophysical\nquantities relating to plaque composition (e.g. total number of macrophages,\ntotal amount of intracellular lipid). We also derive a continuum approximation\nof the model to facilitate analysis of the macrophage lipid distribution. The\nresults, which include time-dependent numerical solutions and asymptotic\nanalysis of the unique steady state solution, indicate that plaque lipid\ncontent is sensitive to the influx of LDL relative to HDL capacity. The\nmacrophage lipid distribution evolves in a wave-like manner towards an\nequilibrium profile which may be monotone decreasing, quasi-uniform or\nunimodal, attaining its maximum value at a non-zero lipid level.

        "summary": "  Antibodies and humoral memory are key components of the adaptive immune\nsystem. We consider and computationally model mechanisms by which humoral\nmemory present at baseline might instead increase infection load; we refer to\nthis effect as EI-HM (enhancement of infection by humoral memory). We first\nconsider antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) in which antibody enhances the\ngrowth of the pathogen, typically a virus, and typically at intermediate\n\"Goldilocks\" levels of antibody. Our ADE model reproduces ADE in vitro and\nenhancement of infection in vivo from passive antibody transfer. But notably\nthe simplest implementation of our ADE model never results in EI-HM. Adding\ncomplexity, by making the cross-reactive antibody much less neutralizing than\nthe de novo generated antibody or by including a sufficiently strong\nnon-antibody immune response, allows for ADE-mediated EI-HM. We next consider\nthe possibility that cross-reactive memory causes EI-HM by crowding out a\npossibly superior de novo immune response. We show that, even without ADE,\nEI-HM can occur when the cross-reactive response is both less potent and\n\"directly\" (i.e. independently of infection load) suppressive with regard to\nthe de novo response. In this case adding a non-antibody immune response to our\ncomputational model greatly reduces or completely eliminates EI-HM, which\nsuggests that \"crowding out\" is unlikely to cause substantial EI-HM. Hence, our\nresults provide examples in which simple models give qualitatively opposite\nresults compared to models with plausible complexity. Our results may be\nhelpful in interpreting and reconciling disparate experimental findings,\nespecially from dengue, and for vaccination.\n",

It has become increasingly evident that dilational and\nvolumetric viscoelasticity of cell clusters and their surrounding substrate\nsignificantly influence these migration modes through physical parameters such\nas: cell and matrix surface tensions, interfacial tension between cells and\nsubstrate, gradients of surface and interfacial tensions, as well as, the\naccumulation of cell and matrix residual stresses. Inhomogeneous distribution\nof cell surface tension along migrating cell cluster can appear as a\nconsequence of different strength of cell-cell adhesion contacts and cell\ncontractility between leader and follower cells. While the directional cell\nmigration caused by the matrix stiffness gradient (i.e. durotaxis) has been\nwidely elaborated, the structural changes of matrix surface caused by cell\ntractions which lead to the generation of the matrix surface tension gradient\nhas not been considered yet.

To investigate the outcome of EGFR mutation in healthy lung stem\ncells, we grew murine alveolar type-II organoids monoclonally in a 3D Matrigel.\nOur experiments showed that the \\textit{EGFR-L858R} mutation induced a change\nin organoid structure: mutated organoids displayed more `budding', in\ncomparison to non-mutant controls, which were nearly spherical. We perform\non-lattice computational simulations, which suggest that this can be explained\nby the concentration of division amongst a small number of cells on the surface\nof the organoid, which may arise from several possible biological mechanisms.\nThese results suggest that the L858R mutation produces structures which expand\nquickly from surface protrusions. We are currently unable to distinguish the\ncell-based mechanisms that lead to this spatial heterogeneity in growth, but\nsuggest a number of future experiments which could be used to do so. We suggest\nthat the likelihood of L858R-fuelled tumorigenesis is affected not just by\nrandom fluctuations in cell fitness, but by whether the mutation arises in a\nspatial environment that allows mutant cells to reproduce without being forced\nto encounter each other.

From a reductionist cell dynamics point of\nview, the strategies allowing size homeostasis are roughly grouped into three\nclasses, \\emph{i.e.} timer, sizer, or adder. These strategies are empirically\ndistinguishable given the phenomenological measurable relationship between the\ncell size at birth and at division, which requires following the proliferation\nat the single-cell level.\n  Here, we show how it is possible to infer the growth regime and division\nstrategy of leukemia cell populations using live cell fluorescence labeling and\nflow cytometry in combination with a quantitative analytical model where both\ncell growth and division rates depend on powers of the cell size.\n  Using our novel approach, we found that the dynamics of the size distribution\nof leukemia Jurkat T-cells is quantitatively reproduced by (i) a sizer-like\ndivision strategy, with (ii) division times following an Erlang distribution\ngiven by the sum of at least three independent exponentially-distributed times\nand (iii) fluctuations up to 15\\% of the inherited fraction of size at division\nwith respect to the mother cell size.

Cell surface stimuli lead to the production of\ninositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which binds to IP3 receptors in the\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) to release calcium pools from the ER lumen. This\nleads to depletion of ER calcium pools which has been termed store-depletion.\nStore-depletion leads the dissociation of calcium ions from the EF-hand motif\nof the ER calcium sensor Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1). This leads to\na conformational change in STIM1 which helps it to interact with a plasma\nmembrane (PM) at ER:PM junctions. At these ER:PM junctions, STIM1 binds to and\nactivates a calcium channel known as Orai1 to form calcium-release activated\ncalcium (CRAC) channels. Activation of Orai1 leads to calcium influx, known as\nstore-operated calcium entry (SOCE). In addition to Orai1 and STIM1, the\nhomologs of Orai1 and STIM1, such as Orai2/3 and STIM2 also play a crucial role\nin calcium homeostasis. The influx of calcium through the Orai channel\nactivates a calcium current that has been termed CRAC currents. CRAC channels\nform multimers and cluster together in large macromolecular assemblies termed\npuncta. How these CRAC channels form puncta has been contentious since their\ndiscovery. In this review, we will outline the history of SOCE, the molecular\nplayers involved in this process (Orai and STIM proteins, TRP channels,\nSOCE-associated regulatory factor etc.), as well as the models that have been\nproposed to explain this important mechanism in cellular physiology.\n",

What statistics in the\ncell's environment control this tradeoff? What properties of the environment\nmake it variable enough that this tradeoff is relevant? We model a single\neukaryotic cell sensing a chemical secreted from bacteria (e.g. folic acid).

The factors that primarily control the\nideal averaging are the ratio of sensing noise to environmental variation, and\nthe ratio of timescales of sensing to the timescale of environmental variation.\nSensing noise depends on the receptor-ligand kinetics, while the environmental\nvariation depends on the density of bacteria and the degradation and diffusion\nproperties of the secreted chemoattractant.

What\nfactors control whether a cell recognizes it has contacted a neighbor? We\npropose a theoretical model for the limits of CIL where cells recognize the\npresence of another cell by binding the protein ephrin with the Eph receptor.\nThis recognition is made difficult by the presence of interfering ligands that\nbind nonspecifically. Both theoretical predictions and simulation results show\nthat it becomes more difficult to sense cell-cell contact when it is difficult\nto distinguish ephrin from the interfering ligands, or when there are more\ninterfering ligands, or when the contact width decreases. However, the error of\nestimating contact position remains almost constant when the contact width\nchanges.

We study using statistical decision theory\nthe likelihood of a false positive CIL event in the absence of cell-cell\ncontact, and the likelihood of a false negative where CIL does not occur when\nanother cell is present.

The revolution of single-cell genomics technologies offers\nunprecedented insights into cellular identities, opening new avenues to resolve\nthe intricate cellular interactions present in tissue niches. CellPhoneDB is a\nbioinformatics toolkit designed to infer cell-cell communication by combining a\ncurated repository of bona fide ligand-receptor interactions with a set of\ncomputational and statistical methods to integrate them with single-cell\ngenomics data. Importantly, CellPhoneDB captures the multimeric nature of\nmolecular complexes, thus representing cell-cell communication biology\nfaithfully. Here we present CellPhoneDB v5, an updated version of the tool,\nwhich offers several new features. Firstly, the repository has been expanded by\none-third with the addition of new interactions. These encompass interactions\nmediated by non-protein ligands such as endocrine hormones and GPCR ligands.\nSecondly, it includes a differentially expression-based methodology for more\ntailored interaction queries. Thirdly, it incorporates novel computational\nmethods to prioritise specific cell-cell interactions, leveraging other\nsingle-cell modalities, such as spatial information or TF activities (i.e.\nCellSign module). Finally, we provide CellPhoneDBViz, a module to interactively\nvisualise and share results amongst users. Altogether, CellPhoneDB v5 elevates\nthe precision of cell-cell communication inference, ushering in new\nperspectives to comprehend tissue biology in both healthy and pathological\nstates.\n",

A paradigm is bacterial chemotaxis, where the output activity of\nchemoreceptors is adapted to different baseline concentrations via receptor\nmethylation. The range of internal receptor states limits the stimulus\nmagnitude to which these systems can adapt. Here, we employ a highly idealized,\nLangevin-equation based model to study how the finite range of state variables\naffects the adaptation accuracy and the energy dissipation in individual and\ncoupled systems. Maintaining an adaptive state requires constant energy\ndissipation. We show that the steady-state dissipation rate increases\napproximately linearly with the adaptation accuracy for varying stimulus\nmagnitudes in the so-called perfect adaptation limit. This result complements\nthe well-known logarithmic cost-accuracy relationship for varying chemical\ndriving. Next, we study linearly coupled pairs of sensory units. We find that\nthe interaction reduces the dissipation rate per unit and affects the overall\ncost-accuracy relationship. A coupling of the slow methylation variables\nresults in a better accuracy than a coupling of activities. Overall, the\nfindings highlight the significance of both the working range and collective\noperation mode as crucial design factors that impact the accuracy and energy\nexpenditure of molecular adaptation networks.\n",

In the current\nwork, we moved away from this idea of discrete state transition and\ninvestigated EMT dynamics in a continuous phenotypic space. We used morphology\nto define the phenotype of a cell.

During EMT, as the morphology changed, the\ndistribution of cells in the morphospace also changed. However, this\nmorphospace had a very high dimension. We reduced it to a 2-dimensional\n\"reduced morphospace\" and investigated the temporal change in the spatial\ndistribution of cells in this reduced space. We used proper orthogonal\ndecomposition to find dominant dynamical features of this spatio-temporal data.\nThe modal analysis detected key features of EMT in this experimental system -\nreversible transition, distinct paths of phenotypic transition during induction\nand reversal of EMT, and enhanced diversity of cells during reversal of EMT.

Despite this versatility of behaviors, population-level measurements\nhave reported low information content (\\textless 1 bit) relayed through the ERK\npathway, rendering the population barely able to distinguish the presence or\nabsence of stimuli. Here, we contrast the information transmitted by a single\ncell and a population of cells. Using a combination of optogenetic experiments,\ndata analysis based on information theory framework, and numerical simulations\nwe quantify the amount of information transduced from the receptor to ERK, from\nresponses to singular, brief and sparse input pulses. We show that single cells\nare indeed able to resolve between graded stimuli, yielding over 2 bit of\ninformation, however showing a large population heterogeneity.\n",

Among these, sarcomere structures are fundamental to\nthe organization and function of the cytoskeletal architecture. In muscle-type\ncells, sarcomeres exhibit ordered structures of consistent lengths, optimized\nfor stable force generation. By contrast, nonmuscle-type cells display a higher\ndegree of structural variability, with sarcomeres of varying lengths that\ncontribute not only to force generation but also to adaptive remodeling upon\nenvironmental cues. While these differences in sarcomere structures have\ntraditionally been attributed to the unique properties of specific proteins\nexpressed in each cell type, the functional implications of such structural\nvariability remain unclear. Here, we present a nonequilibrium physics framework\nto elucidate the role of sarcomere variability in cytoskeletal adaptation.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that the effective binding strength of sarcomere\ncomponents can be evaluated by analyzing structural randomness using Shannon\nentropy. The increased entropy associated with the inherent randomness of\nsarcomere structures in nonmuscle-type cells lowers the energy barrier for\ncytoskeletal remodeling, enabling flexible adaptation to environmental demands.\nMeanwhile, the ordered sarcomere arrangements in muscle-type cells correspond\nto higher binding energies and more stable cytoskeletal configurations.\nAlthough structural disorder is often regarded as unfavorable in terms of\nstability, our study suggests that it plays a key role in enabling adaptive\nresponses in cellular systems.\n",

The existing mathematical models for collective migration of cell\npopulations driven by this non-local form of environmental sensing rely on the\nsimplifying assumption that cells in the population share the same cytoskeletal\nproperties, and thus form surface extensions of the same size. To overcome this\nsimplification, we develop a modelling framework wherein a population of\nmigrating cells is structured by a continuous phenotypic variable that captures\nvariability in structural properties of the cytoskeleton. The framework\nprovides a multiscale representation of collective cell migration, from\nsingle-cell dynamics to population-level behaviours, as we start with a\nmicroscopic model that describes the dynamics of single cells in terms of\nstochastic processes. Next, we formally derive the mesoscopic counterpart of\nthis model, which consists of a phenotype-structured kinetic equation for the\ncell distribution in each of phase and phenotype space. Then, considering an\nappropriately rescaled version of this kinetic equation, we formally derive the\ncorresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a partial differential\nequation for the cell number density. To validate the formal procedure employed\nto derive the macroscopic model from the microscopic one, we first compare the\nresults of numerical simulations of the two models. We then compare numerical\nsolutions of the macroscopic model with the results of cell locomotion assays,\nto test the ability of the model to recapitulate qualitative features of\nexperimental observations.\n",

Model scalability becomes of paramount interest. In an effort to start\naddressing this critical issue, here, we present a novel multi-scale and\nmulti-resolution agent-based in silico glioma model. While \"multi-scale\" refers\nto employing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven molecular\nnetwork to process cellular phenotypic decisions within the micro-macroscopic\nenvironment, \"multi-resolution\" is achieved through algorithms that classify\ncells to either active or inactive spatial clusters, which determine the\nresolution they are simulated at. The aim is to assign computational resources\nwhere and when they matter most for maintaining or improving the predictive\npower of the algorithm, onto specific tumor areas and at particular times.\nUsing a previously described 2D brain tumor model, we have developed four\ndifferent computational methods for achieving the multi-resolution scheme,\nthree of which are designed to dynamically train on the high-resolution\nsimulation that serves as control. To quantify the algorithms' performance, we\nrank them by weighing the distinct computational time savings of the simulation\nruns versus the methods' ability to accurately reproduce the high-resolution\nresults of the control. Finally, to demonstrate the flexibility of the\nunderlying concept, we show the added value of combining the two highest-ranked\nmethods.\n",

A hybrid\nagent-based model has been developed to investigate the synergistic and\nantagonistic cell motility-impacting effects of three microenvironment\nvariables simultaneously: chemoattraction, haptotactic permission, and\nbiomechanical constraint or resistance. Reflecting distinct cell-specific\nintracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modelled as processing a variety\nof spatial search strategies that respond to these three influencing factors\nwith differential weights attached to each. While responding exclusively to\nchemoattraction optimizes cell displacement effectiveness, incorporating\npermission and resistance components becomes increasingly important with\ngreater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the\nligand's effective diffusion coefficient. Extending this to a heterogeneous\npopulation of cells shows that displacement effectiveness increases with clonal\ndiversity as characterized by the Shannon index. However, the resulting data\ncan be fit best to an exponential function, suggesting that there is a level of\npopulation heterogeneity beyond which its added value to the cancer system\nbecomes minimal as directionality ceases to increase.

In the existing literature, the population variation of\nsingle-cell creep compliance has so far been modeled universally by using a\nlog-normal distribution. Here we use optical stretching, a non-contact and\nrelatively high-throughput technique for probing cell mechanics, to accumulate\na sufficient data set that demonstrates robustly that cell compliance varies\naccording to the similar but distinct gamma distribution. Additionally, we\nre-examine existing simulations that were originally proposed to justify a\nlog-normal fit, and show that in fact these simulation data also correspond to\nthe gamma distribution. Finally, we propose a general stochastic differential\nequation that analytically predicts a gamma distribution of creep compliance\nduring cell stretching, as well as the Gaussian distribution of cell recovery\nthat we observe experimentally upon removal of applied load. The population\nvariation is well characterized by just a single parameter in each of the creep\nand recovery regimes. We expect our correction of a phenomenological\ndistribution fit, enabled by an expansive data set for mesenchymal stem cells,\nto enable the development of more accurate constitutive laws to describe\ncytoskeletal deformation. These findings thus serve to replace an empirical\ndistribution with a better-fitting model that rests on a more solid\nexperimental and theoretical foundation, and also provides a basis to predict\nand understand the stochastic nature of the mechanical response of individual\ncells within populations.\n",

We find that the high frequency noise\nis filtered by the output degradation process through time-averaging; while the\nlow frequency noise is damped by adaptation through negative feedback. Both\nfiltering processes themselves introduce intrinsic noises, which are found to\nbe unfiltered and can thus amount to a significant internal noise floor even\nwithout signaling. These results are applied to E. coli chemotaxis. We show\nunambiguously that the molecular mechanism for the Berg-Purcell time-averaging\nscheme is the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY-P, not the\nreceptor adaptation process as previously suggested. The high frequency noise\ndue to the stochastic ligand binding-unbinding events and the random ligand\nmolecule diffusion is averaged by the CheY-P dephosphorylation process to a\nnegligible level in E.coli. We identify a previously unstudied noise source\ncaused by the random motion of the cell in a ligand gradient. We show that this\nrandom walk induced signal noise has a divergent low frequency component, which\nis only rendered finite by the receptor adaptation process. For gradients\nwithin the E. coli sensing range, this dominant external noise can be\ncomparable to the significant intrinsic noise in the system. The dependence of\nthe response and its fluctuations on the key time scales of the system are\nstudied systematically.

It is known to modulate a number of processes\nthat depend on mitochondrial AdN content, such as gluconeogenesis, protein\nsynthesis, and citrulline synthesis. Despite this critical role, a kinetic\nmodel of the underlying mechanism has not been developed and validated. Here, a\nbiophysical model of the APC is developed that is thermodynamically balanced\nand accurately reproduces a number of reported data sets from isolated rat\nliver and rat kidney mitochondria. The model is based on an ordered bi-bi\nmechanism for hetero-exchange of ATP and Pi and also includes homo-exchanges of\nATP and Pi to explain both the initial rate and time course data on ATP and Pi\ntransport via the APC. The model invokes seven kinetic parameters regarding the\nAPC mechanism and three parameters related to matrix pH regulation by external\nPi. These parameters are estimated based on nineteen independent data curves;\nthe estimated parameters are validated using six additional data curves. The\nmodel takes into account the effects of pH, Mg2+ and Ca2+ on ATP and Pi\ntransport via the APC and supports the conclusion that the pH gradient across\nthe IMM serves as the primary driving force for AdN uptake or efflux.

These tissues are\nmaintained by a population of stem cells, which generate differentiated\nprogenies and self-renew. Asymmetric division of each stem cell into one stem\ncell and one differentiated cell can accomplish both tasks. However, in\nmammalian cycling tissues, some stem cells divide symmetrically into two\ndifferentiated cells and are replaced by a neighbor that divides symmetrically\ninto two stem cells. Besides this heterogeneity in fate (population asymmetry),\nstem cells also exhibit heterogenous proliferation-rates; in the long run,\nhowever, all stem cells proliferate at the same average rate (equipotency). We\nconstruct and simulate a mathematical model based on these experimental\nobservations. We show that the complex steady-state dynamics of\npopulation-asymmetric stem cells reduces the rate of replicative aging of the\ntissue --potentially lowering the incidence of somatic mutations and genetics\ndiseases such as cancer. Essentially, slow-dividing stem cells proliferate and\npurge the population of the fast-dividing --older-- cells which had undertaken\nthe majority of the tissue-generation burden. As the number of slow-dividing\ncells grows, their proliferation-rate increases, eventually turning them into\nfast-dividers, which are themselves replaced by newly emerging slow-dividers.\nGoing beyond current experiments, we propose a mechanism for equipotency that\ncan potentially halve the rate of replicative aging.

High resolution numerical simulations\nusing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) of the new model are presented, showing\nthat the chemotactic term enhances the velocity of propagation of the colony\nenvelope for dense-branching morphologies. In addition, the chemotaxis seems to\nstabilize the formation of branches in the soft-agar, low-nutrient regime. An\nasymptotic estimation predicts the growth velocity of the colony envelope as a\nfunction of both the nutrient concentration and the chemotactic sensitivity.\nFor fixed nutrient concentrations, the growth velocity is an increasing\nfunction of the chemotactic sensitivity.\n",

Networks that show cell\ndifferentiation are extracted and two forms of symmetric differentiation based\non Turing's mechanism and asymmetric differentiation are identified.

Differentiation to a fixed-point type\nbehavior follows with a further increase in the number of cells. The cell type\nwith oscillatory dynamics corresponds to a stem cell that can both proliferate\nand differentiate, while the latter fixed-point type only proliferates. This\ndifferentiation is analyzed as a saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant\ncircle, while the number ratio of each cell type is shown to be robust against\nperturbations due to self-consistent determination of the effective bifurcation\nparameter as a result of the cell--cell interaction. Complex cell\ndifferentiation is designed by combing these simple two-gene networks. The\ngenerality of the present differentiation mechanism, as well as its biological\nrelevance, is discussed.\n",

Since protein composition determines responses in\nindividual cells, it stands to reason that the variations themselves are\nsubject to selective pressures. But the functional role of these cell-to-cell\ndifferences is not well understood. One way to tackle questions regarding\nrelationships between form and function is to perturb the form (e.g., change\nthe protein abundances) and observe the resulting changes in some function.\nHere we take on the form-function relationship from the inverse perspective,\nasking instead what specific constraints on cell-to-cell variations in protein\nabundance are imposed by a given functional phenotype. We develop a maximum\nentropy (MaxEnt) based approach to posing questions of this type, and\nillustrate the method by application to the well characterized chemotactic\nresponse in Escherichia coli (E. coli). We find that full determination of\nobserved cell-to-cell variations in protein abundances is not inherent in\nchemotaxis itself, but in fact appears to be jointly imposed by the chemotaxis\nprogram in conjunction with other factors, e.g., the protein synthesis\nmachinery and/or additional non-chemotactic cell functions such as cell\nmetabolism.

With multiple strategies available\nfor acquisition of this nondimensional property, fluidity may serve as a useful\nand robust parameter for distinguishing cell populations, and for understanding\nthe physical origins of deformability in soft matter. Here, for three disparate\neukaryotic cell types deformed in the suspended state via optical stretching,\nwe examine the dependence of fluidity on chemical and environmental influences\naround a time scale of 1 s. We find that fluidity estimates are consistent in\nthe time and the frequency domains under a structural damping (power-law or\nfractional derivative)model, but not under an equivalent-complexity\nlumpedcomponent (spring-dashpot) model; the latter predicts spurious time\nconstants. Although fluidity is suppressed by chemical crosslinking, we find\nthat adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in the cell does not measurably\nalter the parameter, and thus conclude that active ATP-driven events are not a\ncrucial enabler of fluidity during linear viscoelastic deformation of a\nsuspended cell.

Therefore, AQP1 has been proposed as a novel\npromoter of tumor angiogenesis.

Conclusions/Significance: All together,\nour findings show that AQP1 plays a role inside the cells through\nLin-7/b-catenin interaction.

In the former,\nsplenocytes from knocked out (KO) mice engineered to silence the transcription\nfactor IRF-8, crucial for the development and function of several immune\npopulations, were used.

Osteocytes derive from bone-synthesising cells (osteoblasts) that\nbecome buried in bone matrix during bone deposition. The generation of\nosteocytes is a complex process that remains incompletely understood. Whilst\nosteoblast burial determines the density of osteocytes, the expanding network\nof osteocytes regulates in turn osteoblast activity and osteoblast burial. In\nthis paper, a spatiotemporal continuous model is proposed to investigate the\nosteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. The aims of the model are (i) to link\ndynamic properties of osteocyte generation with properties of the osteocyte\nnetwork imprinted in bone, and (ii) to investigate Marotti's hypothesis that\nosteocytes prompt the burial of osteoblasts when they become covered with\nsufficient bone matrix. Osteocyte density is assumed in the model to be\ngenerated at the moving bone surface by a combination of osteoblast density,\nmatrix secretory rate, rate of entrapment, and curvature of the bone substrate,\nbut is found to be determined solely by the ratio of the instantaneous burial\nrate and matrix secretory rate. Osteocyte density does not explicitly depend on\nosteoblast density nor curvature. Osteocyte apoptosis is also included to\ndistinguish between the density of osteocyte lacuna and the density of live\nosteocytes. Experimental measurements of osteocyte lacuna densities are used to\nestimate the rate of burial of osteoblasts in bone matrix. These results\nsuggest that: (i) burial rate decreases during osteonal infilling, and (ii) the\ncontrol of osteoblast burial by osteocytes is likely to emanate as a collective\nsignal from a large group of osteocytes, rather than from the osteocytes\nclosest to the bone deposition front.\n",

No\ndetectable changes in the cellular morphology or attachment of A549 cells\ngrowing on graphene thin films or cells exposed to graphene flakes (0.1 to 5\nug/mL) for 4 to 72 h was observed. Graphene treatments caused a very low level\nof increase in cellular production of reactive oxygen species in A549 cells,\nbut no detectable damage to the nuclei such as changes in morphology,\ncondensation or fragmentation was observed. In contrast, carbon black proved to\nbe significantly more toxic than the graphene. These data open up a promising\nview of using graphene enabled composites for a diverse scope of safer\napplications.\n",

Here we present a novel\ncomputational model to reproduce the probability of glioma incidence across the\nlifespan. Previous mathematical models explaining glioma incidence are framed\nin a rather abstract way, and do not directly relate to empirical findings. To\ndecrease this gap between theory and experimental observations, we incorporate\nrecent data on cellular and molecular factors underlying gliomagenesis. Since\nevidence implicates the adult neural stem cell as the likely cell-of-origin of\nglioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem\ncell number, cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our\nmodel. We demonstrate that our model yields results which match actual\ndemographic data in the human population. In particular, this model accounts\nfor the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age,\nwithout the need to assert differential susceptibility throughout the\npopulation. Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that glioma is caused by\nrandomly-occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell population.\nBased on this model, we assess the influence of the (experimentally indicated)\ndecrease in the number of neural stem cells and increase of cell division rate\nduring aging. Our model provides multiple testable predictions, and suggests\nthat different temporal sequences of oncogenic mutations can lead to\ntumorigenesis. Finally, we conclude that four or five oncogenic mutations are\nsufficient for the formation of glioma.\n",

However, in many neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders,\nmicrotubules and neurofilaments segregate apart from each other, with\nmicrotubules and membranous organelles clustered centrally and neurofilaments\ndisplaced to the periphery. This striking segregation precedes abnormal and\nexcessive neurofilament accumulation in these diseases, which in turn leads to\nfocal axonal swellings. While neurofilament accumulation suggests the\nimpairment of neurofilament transport along axons, the underlying mechanism of\ntheir segregation from microtubules remains poorly understood for over 30\nyears. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model for\nthe cross-sectional distribution of microtubules and neurofilaments in axons.\nThe model describes microtubules, neurofilaments and organelles as interacting\nparticles in a 2D cross-section, and incorporates the stochastic interactions\nthese particles through molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate\nthat organelles can pull nearby microtubules together, and in the absence of\nneurofilament transport, this mechanism gradually segregates microtubules from\nneurofilaments on a time scale of hours, similar to that observed in toxic\nneuropathies. This suggests that the microtubule-neurofilament segregation is\nsimply a consequence of the selective impairment of neurofilament transport.\nThe model generates the experimentally testable prediction that the rate and\nextent of segregation will be dependent on the sizes of the moving organelles\nas well as the density of their traffic.\n",

Here, we describe a simple and generic framework in which two common\nformalisms can be used interchangeably: (i) a continuous-time division process\ndescribed by a hazard function and (ii) a discrete-time equation describing\ncell size across generations (where the unit of time is a cell cycle). In our\nframework, this second process is a discrete-time Langevin equation with a\nsimple physical analogue.

As\nwe show by analytical estimates and numerical simulation, the available data\nare characterized with great precision by the first-order approximation of this\nexpansion.

These heterocysts form a\nquasi-regular pattern in the filament, representing a prototype of patterning\nand morphogenesis in prokaryotes. Recent years have seen advances in the\nidentification of the molecular mechanism regulating this pattern. We use this\ndata to build a theory on heterocyst pattern formation, for which both genetic\nregulation and the effects of cell division and filament growth are key\ncomponents. The theory is based on the interplay of three generic mechanisms:\nlocal autoactivation, early long range inhibition, and late long range\ninhibition. These mechanisms can be identified with the dynamics of hetR, patS\nand hetN expression. Our theory reproduces quantitatively the experimental\ndynamics of pattern formation and maintenance for wild type and mutants. We\nfind that hetN alone is not enough to play the role as the late inhibitory\nmechanism: a second mechanism, hypothetically the products of nitrogen fixation\nsupplied by heterocysts, must also play a role in late long range inhibition.\nThe preponderance of even intervals between heterocysts arises naturally as a\nresult of the interplay between the timescales of genetic regulation and cell\ndivision. We also find that a purely stochastic initiation of the pattern,\nwithout a two-stage process, is enough to reproduce experimental observations.\n",

However, how\nexactly geometry influences the behaviour of bone-forming cells remains\nelusive. Geometry modulates cell populations collectively through the evolving\nspace available to the cells, but it may also modulate the individual\nbehaviours of cells. To factor out the collective influence of geometry and\ngain access to the geometric regulation of individual cell behaviours, we\ndevelop a mathematical model of the infilling of cortical bone pores and use it\nwith available experimental data on cortical infilling rates. Testing different\npossible modes of geometric controls of individual cell behaviours consistent\nwith the experimental data, we find that efficient smoothing of irregular pores\nonly occurs when cell secretory rate is controlled by porosity rather than\ncurvature. This porosity control suggests the convergence of a large scale of\nintercellular signalling to single bone-forming cells, consistent with that\nprovided by the osteocyte network in response to mechanical stimulus. After\nvalidating the mathematical model with the histological record of a real\ncortical pore infilling, we explore the infilling of a population of randomly\ngenerated initial pore shapes. We find that amongst all the geometric\nregulations considered, the collective influence of curvature on cell crowding\nis a dominant factor for how fast cortical bone pores infill, and we suggest\nthat the irregularity of cement lines thereby explains some of the variability\nin double labelling data as well as the overall speed of osteon infilling.\n",

We thus test computationally different hypotheses on late\nstages of bone mineralisation by simulating BMDDs in low turnover conditions.\nMaterials and Methods: An established computational model of the BMDD that\naccounts for mineralisation and remodelling processes was extended to limit\nmineralisation to various maximum calcium capacities of bone. Simulated BMDDs\nobtained by reducing turnover rate from the reference trabecular BMDD under\ndifferent assumptions on late stage mineralisation kinetics were compared with\nexperimental BMDDs of low-turnover bone. Results: Simulations show that an\nabrupt stopping of mineralisation near a maximum calcium capacity induces a\npile-up of minerals in the BMDD statistics that is not observed experimentally.\nWith a smooth decrease of mineralisation rate, imposing low maximum calcium\ncapacities helps to match peak location and width of simulated low turnover\nBMDDs with peak location and width of experimental BMDDs, but results in a\ndistinctive asymmetric peak shape. No tuning of turnover rate and maximum\ncalcium capacity was able to explain the differences found in experimental\nBMDDs between trabecular bone (high turnover) and femoral cortical bone (low\nturnover). Conclusions: Secondary mineralisation in human bone does not stop\nabruptly, but continues slowly up to a calcium content greater than 30 wt% Ca.\nThe similar mineral heterogeneity seen in trabecular and femoral cortical bones\nat different peak locations was unexplained by turnover differences tested.\n",

Presence of stochastic noise in the biochemical pathway of the\ncell has important consequence on the switching mechanism of motor bias, which\nin turn affects the runs and tumbles of the cell. We model the intra-cellular\nreaction network in terms of coupled time-evolution of three stochastic\nvariables, kinase activity, methylation level and CheY-P protein level, and\nstudy the effect of methylation noise on the chemotactic performance of the\ncell. In presence of a spatially varying nutrient concentration profile, a good\nchemotactic performance allows the cell to climb up the concentration gradient\nfast and localize in the nutrient-rich regions in the long time limit. Our\nsimulations show that the best performance is obtained at an optimal noise\nstrength. While it is expected that chemotaxis will be weaker for very large\nnoise, it is counter-intuitive that the performance worsens even when noise\nlevel falls below a certain value. We explain this striking result by detailed\nanalysis of CheY-P protein level statistics for different noise strengths. We\nshow that when the CheY-P level falls below a certain (noise-dependent)\nthreshold, the cell tends to move down the concentration gradient of the\nnutrient, which has a detrimental effect on its chemotactic response. This\nthreshold value decreases as noise is increased, and this effect is responsible\nfor noise-induced enhancement of chemotactic performance. In a harsh chemical\nenvironment, when the nutrient degrades with time, the amount of nutrient\nintercepted by the cell trajectory, is an effective performance criterion. In\nthis case also, we find an optimum noise strength, depending on the nutrient\nlifetime.\n",

Although the inductive approach\nhas not been effective in developing medical treatments, it has amassed enough\ninformation to allow construction of quantitative, deductive models of acute\ncell injury. In this work we develop a modeling approach by extending an\nautonomous nonlinear dynamic theory of acute cell injury that offered new ways\nto conceptualize cell injury but possessed limitations that decrease its\neffectiveness. Here we study the global dynamics of the cell injury theory\nusing a nonautonomous formulation. Different from the standard scenario in\nnonlinear dynamics that is determined by the steady state and fixed points of\nthe model equations, in this nonautonomous model with a trivial fixed point,\nthe system property is dominated by the transient states and the corresponding\ndynamic processes. The model gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical\npatterns that can be mapped to the behavior of cells after clinical acute\ninjuries. The nonautonomous theory predicts the existence of a latent stress\nresponse capacity (LSRC) possessed by injured cells. The LSRC provides a\ntheoretical explanation of how therapies, such as hypothermia, can prevent cell\ndeath after lethal injuries. The nonautonomous theory of acute cell injury\nprovides an improved quantitative framework for understanding cell death and\nrecovery and lays a foundation for developing effective therapeutics for acute\ninjury.\n",

The cells consist of two disks, modelling the\ncell body and a pseudopod, connected by a finite extensible spring. The cells\nexhibit locomotion due to a linear coupling of the motility force to the cell\nextension. With a simple mechanism for contact inhibition of proliferation, we\nfind the typical regimes of colony growth, with exponential growth at short\ntimes turning into sub-exponential growth at long times. In the latter regime\nthe colony boundary moves outwards with a constant speed. We identify simple\nscaling relations for both regimes and the crossover between them. We find that\nthe shape of the cells (the ratio between the two disk's radii) determines the\nefficiency with which cells orient themselves away from the colony. The better\nthe cells are at aligning themselves away from the colony, the faster the\ncolony expands.\n",

        "summary": "  In cell extrusion, a cell embedded in an epithelial monolayer loses its\napical or basal surface and is subsequently squeezed out of the monolayer by\nneighboring cells. Cell extrusions occur during apoptosis,\nepithelial-mesenchymal transition, or pre-cancerous cell invasion. They play\nimportant roles in embryogenesis, homeostasis, carcinogenesis, and many other\nbiological processes. Although many of the molecular factors involved in cell\nextrusion are known, little is known about the mechanical basis of cell\nextrusion. We used a three-dimensional (3D) vertex model to investigate the\nmechanical stability of cells arranged in a monolayer with 3D foam geometry. We\nfound that when the cells composing the monolayer have homogeneous mechanical\nproperties, cells are extruded from the monolayer when the symmetry of the 3D\ngeometry is broken due to an increase in cell density or a decrease in the\nnumber of topological neighbors around single cells. Those results suggest that\nmechanical instability inherent in the 3D foam geometry of epithelial\nmonolayers is sufficient to drive epithelial cell extrusion. In the situation\nwhere cells in the monolayer actively generate contractile or adhesive forces\nunder the control of intrinsic genetic programs, the forces act to break the\nsymmetry of the monolayer, leading to cell extrusion that is directed to the\napical or basal side of the monolayer by the balance of contractile and\nadhesive forces on the apical and basal sides. Although our analyses are based\non a simple mechanical model, our results are in accordance with observations\nof epithelial monolayers {\\it in vivo} and consistently explain cell extrusions\nunder a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Our\nresults illustrate the importance of a mechanical understanding of cell\nextrusion and provide a basis by which to link molecular regulation to physical\nprocesses.\n",

To model the transport of cell wall\nbuilding material to the cell wall we follow Bartnicki-Garcia et al in assuming\nthat the cell wall building material is transported in straight lines by an\nisotropic point source. To model the dynamics of the cell wall, including its\ngrowth by new material, we use the approach of Campas and Mahadevan, which\nassumes that the cell wall is a thin viscous sheet sustained by a pressure\ndifference.

During sprouting, a highly motile type of\nendothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed\nby stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To\nget more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an\nexisting computational model of vascular network formation based on the\ncellular Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a\npriori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To\npredict potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip\ncells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the\nangiogenic networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less\neffectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to\nthe tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A\ncomparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip\nand stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its\nreceptor APJ may match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we\ninhibited Apelin signaling in our model and in an \\emph{in vitro} model of\nangiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of\nits receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the prediction of the\ncomputational model, we propose that the differential expression of Apelin and\nAPJ yields a \"self-generated\" gradient mechanisms that accelerates the\nextension of the sprout.\n",

With theory and simulation, we show collective chemotaxis is\nlimited by cell-to-cell variation in signaling.

We study this general mechanism of\n\"collective guidance\" computationally with models that integrate stochastic\ndynamics for individual cells with biochemical reactions within the cells, and\ndiffusion of chemical signals between the cells. We show that if clusters of\ncells use the well-known local excitation, global inhibition (LEGI) mechanism\nto sense chemoattractant gradients, the speed of the cell cluster becomes\nnon-monotonic in the cluster's size - clusters either larger or smaller than an\noptimal size will have lower speed. We argue that the cell cluster speed is a\ncrucial readout of how the cluster processes chemotactic signal; both\namplification and adaptation will alter the behavior of cluster speed as a\nfunction of size. We also show that, contrary to the assumptions of earlier\ntheories, collective guidance does not require persistent cell-cell contacts\nand strong short range adhesion to function. If cell-cell adhesion is absent,\nand the cluster cohesion is instead provided by a co-attraction mechanism, e.g.\nchemotaxis toward a secreted molecule, collective guidance may still function.\nHowever, new behaviors, such as cluster rotation, may also appear in this case.\nTogether, the combination of co-attraction and adaptation allows for collective\nguidance that is robust to varying chemoattractant concentrations while not\nrequiring strong cell-cell adhesion.\n",

Third, this cell aggregate is robust in the number distribution of\ndifferentiated cell types. We here address how cells acquire the ability of\ncell differentiation and division of labor simultaneously, which is also\nconnected with the robustness of a cell society. For this purpose, we developed\na dynamical-systems model of cells consisting of chemical components with\nintracellular catalytic reaction dynamics. The reactions convert external\nnutrients into internal components for cellular growth, and the divided cells\ninteract via chemical diffusion. We found that cells sharing an identical\ncatalytic network spontaneously differentiate via induction from cell-cell\ninteractions, and then achieve division of labor, enabling a higher growth rate\nthan that in the unicellular case. This symbiotic differentiation emerged for a\nclass of reaction networks with limited resources and strong cell-cell\ninteractions. Then, robustness in the cell type distribution was achieved,\nwhile instability of collective growth could emerge even among the cooperative\ncells when the internal reserves of products were dominant. The present\nmechanism is simple and general as a natural result of interacting cells with\nresource limitation, and is consistent with the observed behaviors and forms of\nseveral aggregates of unicellular organisms.\n",

A deeper understanding of\nbiological polarity pattern formation can be gained from the consideration of\npattern reorganisation in response to an opposing instructive cue, which we\nhere consider by example of experimentally inducible body axis inversions in\nplanarian flatworms. Our dynamically diluted alignment model represents three\nprocesses: entrainment of cell polarity by a global signal, local cell-cell\ncoupling aligning polarity among neighbours and cell turnover inserting\ninitially unpolarised cells. We show that a persistent global orienting signal\ndetermines the final mean polarity orientation in this stochastic model.\nCombining numerical and analytical approaches, we find that neighbour coupling\nretards polarity pattern reorganisation, whereas cell turnover accelerates it.\nWe derive a formula for an effective neighbour coupling strength integrating\nboth effects and find that the time of polarity reorganisation depends linearly\non this effective parameter and no abrupt transitions are observed. This allows\nto determine neighbour coupling strengths from experimental observations.

Such mechanosensitive responses to ECM mechanics are key to\nunderstanding the regulation of biological tissues by mechanical cues, as it\noccurs, e.g., during angiogenesis and the alignment of cells in muscles and\ntendons. Although it is well established that the mechanical cell-ECM\ninteractions are mediated by focal adhesions, the mechanosensitive molecular\ncomplexes linking the cytoskeleton to the substrate, it is poorly understood\nhow the stiffness-dependent kinetics of the focal adhesions eventually produce\nthe observed interdependence of substrate stiffness and cell shape and cell\nbehavior. Here we show that the mechanosensitive behavior of single-focal\nadhesions, cell contractility and substrate adhesivity together suffice to\nexplain the observed stiffness-dependent behavior of cells. We introduce a\nmultiscale computational model that is based upon the following assumptions:\n(1) cells apply forces onto the substrate through FAs; (2) the FAs grow and\nstabilize due to these forces; (3) within a given time-interval, the force that\nthe FAs experience is lower on soft substrates than on stiffer substrates due\nto the time it takes to reach mechanical equilibrium; and (4) smaller FAs are\npulled from the substrate more easily than larger FAs. Our model combines the\ncellular Potts model for the cells with a finite-element model for the\nsubstrate, and describes each FA using differential equations. Together these\nassumptions provide a unifying model for cell spreading, cell elongation and\ndurotaxis in response to substrate mechanics.\n",

Telomeres at\nthe end of each chromosome are shortened at cell division and, when they reach\na critical length, the cell will enter permanent cell cycle arrest - a state\nknown as senescence. This mechanism is thought to be tumor suppressing, as it\nhelps prevent precancerous cells from dividing uncontrollably.\n  Stem cells express the enzyme telomerase, which elongates the telomeres,\nthereby postponing senescence. However, unlike germ cells and most types of\ncancer cells, stem cells only express telomerase at levels insufficient to\nfully maintain the length of their telomeres leading to a slow decline in\nproliferation potential. It is not yet fully understood how this decline\ninfluences the risk of cancer and the longevity of the organism. We here\ndevelop a stochastic model to explore the role of telomere dynamics in relation\nto both senescence and cancer. The model describes the accumulation of\ncancerous mutations in a multicellular organism and creates a coherent\ntheoretical framework for interpreting the results of several recent\nexperiments on telomerase regulation. We demonstrate that the longest average\ncancer free life span before cancer onset is obtained when stem cells start\nwith relatively long telomeres that are shortened at a steady rate at cell\ndivision. Furthermore, the risk of cancer early in life can be reduced by\nhaving a short initial telomere length.

Two mechanisms were found for reprogramming in a\ntwo level hierarchy: cycle specific perturbations and a noise-induced\nswitching. The former corresponds to a \\emph{directed} perturbation that\ninduces a transition into a cycle state of a different cell type in the potency\nhierarchy (mainly a stem cell) whilst the latter is a priori undirected and\ncould be induced, e.g., by a (stochastic) change in the cellular environment.\nThese reprogramming protocols were found to be effective in large regimes of\nthe parameter space and make specific predictions concerning reprogramming\ndynamics which are broadly in line with experimental findings.\n",

        "summary": "  Cell migration in fibreous extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial to many\nphysiological and pathological processes such as tissue regeneration, immune\nresponse and cancer progression. During migration, individual cells can\ngenerate active pulling forces via actin filament contraction, which are\ntransmitted to the ECM fibers through focal adhesion complexes, remodel the\nECM, and eventually propagate to and can be sensed by other cells in the\nsystem. The microstructure and physical properties of the ECM can also\nsignificantly influence cell migration, e.g., via durotaxis and contact\nguidance. Here, we develop a computational model for cell migration regulated\nby cell-ECM micro-mechanical coupling. Our model explicitly takes into account\na variety of cellular level processes including focal adhesion formation and\ndisassembly, active traction force generation and cell locomotion due to actin\nfilament contraction, transmission and propagation of tensile forces in the\nECM, as well as the resulting ECM remodeling. We validate our model by\naccurately reproducing single-cell dynamics of MCF-10A breast cancer cells\nmigrating on collagen gels and show that the durotaxis and contact guidance\neffects naturally arise as a consequence of the cell-ECM micro-mechanical\ninteractions considered in the model. Moreover, our model predicts strongly\ncorrelated multi-cellular migration dynamics, which are resulted from the\nECM-mediated mechanical coupling among the migrating cell and are subsequently\nverified in {\\it in vitro} experiments using MCF-10A cells. Our computational\nmodel provides a robust tool to investigate emergent collective dynamics of\nmulti-cellular systems in complex {\\it in vivo} micro-environment and can be\nutilized to design {\\it in vitro} micro-environments to guide collective\nbehaviors and self-organization of cells.\n",

A\nsimilar, but highly deranged process might also occur during the aberrant\ngrowth of cancers, which frequently display a loss of the orderly structures of\nthe tissue of origin, but retain a multicellular organization in the form of\nspheroids, strands, and buds. The latter structures are often seen when tumors\nmasses switch to an invasive behavior into surrounding tissues. However, the\ngeneral physical principles governing the self-organized architectures of tumor\ncell populations remain by and large unclear. In this work, we perform in-vitro\nexperiments to characterize the growth properties of glioblastoma budding\nemerging from monolayers. Using a theoretical model and numerical tools here we\nfind that such a topological transition is a self-organised, non-equilibrium\nphenomenon driven by the trade--off of mechanical forces and physical\ninteractions exerted at cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions. Notably, the\nunstable disorder states of uncontrolled cellular proliferation macroscopically\nemerge as complex spatio--temporal patterns that evolve statistically\ncorrelated by a universal law.\n",

To gain a better understanding of which signaling pathways or\ncombination of pathways are linked to NTS1 activation and function, we\ninvestigated the ability of activated hNTS1, which was stably expressed by\nCHO-K1 cells, to directly engage G proteins, activate second messenger cascades\nand recruit \\b{eta}-arrestins. Using BRET-based biosensors, we found that\nneurotensin (NT), NT(8-13) and neuromedin N (NN) activated the G{\\alpha}q-,\nG{\\alpha}i1-, G{\\alpha}oA-, and G{\\alpha}13-protein signaling pathways as well\nas the recruitment of \\b{eta}-arrestins 1 and 2. Using pharmacological\ninhibitors, we further demonstrated that all three ligands stimulated the\nproduction of inositol phosphate and modulation of cAMP accumulation along with\nERK1/2 activation. Interestingly, despite the functional coupling to\nG{\\alpha}i1 and G{\\alpha}oA, NT was found to produce higher levels of cAMP in\nthe presence of pertussis toxin, supporting that hNTS1 activation leads to cAMP\naccumulation in a G{\\alpha}s-dependent manner. Additionally, we demonstrated\nthat the full activation of ERK1/2 required signaling through both a\nPTX-sensitive Gi/o-c-Src signaling pathway and PLCb-DAG-PKC-Raf-1- dependent\npathway downstream of Gq. Finally, the whole-cell integrated signatures\nmonitored by the cell-based surface plasmon resonance and changes in the\nelectrical impedance of a confluent cell monolayer led to identical phenotypic\nresponses between the three ligands. The characterization of the hNTS1-mediated\ncellular signaling network will be helpful to accelerate the validation of\npotential NTS1 biased ligands with an improved therapeutic/adverse effect\nprofile.\n",

In particular, our analysis provides strong\nevidence that (i) pre-antral follicles produce anti-M{\\\"u}llerian hormone\nindependently of effects from other follicles, (ii) oocytes mature to\nmetaphase-II independently of the woman's age, her BMI, and other factors,\n(iii) early embryo development is memoryless for the variables assessed here,\nin that the probability of an embryo transitioning from its current\ndevelopmental stage to the next is independent of its previous stage. Our\nresults both provide insight into the fundamentals of oogenesis and\nembryogenesis and have implications for the clinical practice of IVF.\n",

This arrangement enables\nthe ballistic transport of cargo bound to microtubules, both dynein mediated\ntransport towards the MTOC and kinesin mediated transport away from it,\ninterspersed with diffusion for unbound cargo-motor complexes. Spatial and\ntemporal positioning of the MTOC allows for bidirectional transport towards and\naway from specific organelles and locations within the cell and also the\nsequestering and subsequent dispersal of dynein transported cargo. The general\nprinciples governing dynamics, efficiency and tunability of such transport in\nthe MTOC vicinity is not fully understood. To address this, we develop a\none-dimensional model that includes advective transport towards an attractor\n(such as the MTOC), and diffusive transport that allows particles to reach\nabsorbing boundaries (such as cellular membranes). We calculated the mean first\npassage time (MFPT) for cargo to reach the boundaries as a measure of the\neffectiveness of sequestering (large MFPT) and diffusive dispersal (low MFPT).\nThe MFPT experiences a dramatic growth in magnitude, transitioning from a low\nto high MFPT regime (dispersal to sequestering) over a window of cargo\nattachment/detachment rates that is close to in vivo values. We find that\nincreasing either the attachment or detachment rate, while fixing the other,\ncan result in optimal dispersal when the attractor is placed asymmetrically.\nFinally, we describe a rare event regime, where the escape location is\nexponentially sensitive to the attractor positioning. Our results suggest that\nstructures such as the MTOC allow for the sensitive control of the spatial and\ntemporal features of transport and corresponding function under physiological\nconditions.\n",

The result is a non-monotonic\nrelationship between aggregate size and average velocity with both a\ntheoretically predicted and empirically observed optimum of 6-7\nsperm/aggregate. To understand the role of sexual selection in driving these\nsperm group dynamics, we compared two sister-species with divergent mating\nsystems and find that sperm of $P.\\,maniculatus$ (highly promiscuous), which\nhave evolved under intense competition, form optimal-sized aggregates more\noften than sperm of $P.\\,polionotus$ (strictly monogamous), which lack\ncompetition.

This induces a functional coupling between\nmovement and sensation, since tumbling probability is controlled by the\ninternal state of the organism which, in turn, depends on previous signal\nlevels. Although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state\nclose to adapted levels, positive feedback can arise when motion up the\ngradient reduces tumbling probability, further boosting drift up the gradient.\nImportantly, such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the\ninternal state, complicating analytical approaches. Previous studies focused on\nwhat happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics. By contrast, we\nshow here that there is a large portion of physiologically-relevant parameter\nspace where the positive feedback can dominate, even when gradients are\nrelatively shallow. We demonstrate how large transients emerge because of\nnon-normal dynamics (non-orthogonal eigenvectors near a stable fixed point)\ninherent in the positive feedback, and further identify a fundamental\nnonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect. Most importantly, this\namplification is asymmetric, elongating runs in favorable directions and\nabbreviating others. The result is a \"ratchet-like\" gradient climbing behavior\nwith drift speeds that can approach half the maximum run speed of the organism.\nOur results thus show that the classical drawback of run-and-tumble navigation\n--- wasteful runs in the wrong direction --- can be mitigated by exploiting the\nnon-normal dynamics implicit in the run-and-tumble strategy.\n",

We develop a\ngeneralized continuum hydrodynamic description and describe the tissue as a two\ncomponent fluid system. The cells and the interstitial fluid are the two\ncomponents and we keep all terms allowed by symmetry. In particular we keep\ntrack of the cell pumping activity for both solvent flow and electric current\nand discuss the corresponding orders of magnitude. We study the growth dynamics\nof tissue slabs, their steady states and obtain the dependence of the cell\nvelocity, net cell division rate, and cell stress on the flow strength and the\napplied electric field. We find that finite thickness tissue slabs exist only\nin a restricted region of phase space and that relatively modest electric\nfields or imposed external flows can induce either proliferation or death.\n",

Since the initial\nrepertoire is the result of random gene rearrangement, binding of receptors is\nnot limited to pathogen-associated antigens but also includes self antigens.\nThere is a fine balance between having a diverse repertoire, protecting from\nmany different pathogens, and yet reducing its self-reactivity as far as\npossible to avoid damage to self. In the ageing immune system this balance is\naltered, manifesting in reduced specificity of response to pathogens or\nvaccination on a background of higher self-reactivity. To answer the question\nwhether age-related changes of repertoire in the diversity and self/non-self\naffinity balance of antibodies could explain the reduced efficacy of the\nhumoral response in older people, we construct a minimal mathematical model of\nthe humoral immune response. The principle of least damage allows us, for a\ngiven repertoire of antibodies, to resolve a tension between the necessity to\nneutralise target antigens as quickly as possible and the requirement to limit\nthe damage to self antigens leading to an optimal dynamics of immune response.\nThe model predicts slowing down of immune response for repertoires with reduced\ndiversity and increased self-reactivity.\n",

These pathological\nchanges can be traced back to malfunctions of cellular signalling pathways, and\ncalcium signalling plays a prominent role in these. We formulate a new model\nfor cancer cell movement which for the first time explicitly accounts for the\ndependence of cell proliferation and cell-cell adhesion on calcium. At the\nheart of our work is a non-linear, integro-differential (non-local) equation\nfor cancer cell movement, accounting for cell diffusion, advection and\nproliferation. We also employ an established model of cellular calcium\nsignalling with a rich dynamical repertoire that includes experimentally\nobserved periodic wave trains and solitary pulses. The cancer cell density\nexhibits travelling fronts and complex spatial patterns arising from an\nadhesion-driven instability (ADI). We show how the different calcium signals\nand variations in the strengths of cell-cell attraction and repulsion shape the\nemergent cellular aggregation patterns, which are a key component of the\nmetastatic process. Performing a linear stability analysis, we identify\nparameter regions corresponding to ADI. These regions are confirmed by\nnumerical simulations, which also reveal different types of aggregation\npatterns and these patterns are significantly affected by \\ca. Our study\ndemonstrates that the maximal cell density decreases with calcium\nconcentration, while the frequencies of the calcium oscillations and the cell\ndensity oscillations are approximately equal in many cases. Furthermore, as the\ncalcium levels increase the speed of the travelling fronts increases, which is\nrelated to a higher cancer invasion potential. These novel insights provide a\nstep forward in the design of new cancer treatments that may rely on\ncontrolling the dynamics of cellular calcium.\n",

The model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations\n(ODE) that describe platelet aggregation (adhesion and cohesion),\nsoluble-agonist-dependent platelet activation, and the flow of blood through\nthe injury. The formation of platelet aggregates increases resistance to flow\nthrough the injury, which is modeled using the Stokes-Brinkman equations. Data\nfrom analogous experimental (microfluidic flow) and partial differential\nequation models informed parameter values used in the ODE model description of\nplatelet adhesion, cohesion, and activation. This model predicts injury\nocclusion under a range of flow and platelet activation conditions. Simulations\ntesting the effects of shear and activation rates resulted in delayed occlusion\nand aggregate heterogeneity. These results validate our hypothesis that\nflow-mediated dilution of activating chemical ADP hinders aggregate\ndevelopment.

During the\nspreading of the monolayer, it is known that so-called \"leader cells\" generate\nthe driving force and lead the other cells. Our time-lapse observations of cell\nbehavior showed that these leader cells appeared at the early stage of the\nspreading, and formed the monolayer protrusion. Informed by these observations,\nwe developed a simple mathematical model that included differences in cell\nmotility, cell-cell adhesion, and random cell movement. The model reproduced\nthe quantitative characteristics obtained from the experiment, such as the\nspreading speed, the distribution of the increment, and the dynamic scaling\nlaw. Analysis of the model equation revealed that the model could reproduce the\ndifferent scaling law from ${\\alpha} = 0.5, {\\beta} = 0.25$ to ${\\alpha} = 0.9,\n{\\beta} = 0.75$, and the exponents ${\\alpha}, {\\beta}$ were determined by the\ntwo indices: $\\rho t$ and $c$.

In this paper,\nwe develop and investigate a phenotype-structured model of solid tumour growth\nin which cells are structured by a stemness level, which varies continuously\nbetween stem-like and terminally differentiated behaviours. Cell evolution is\ndriven by proliferation and apoptosis, as well as advection and diffusion with\nrespect to the stemness structure variable. We use the model to investigate how\nthe environment, in particular oxygen levels, affects the tumour's population\ndynamics and composition, and its response to radiotherapy. We use a\ncombination of numerical and analytical techniques to quantify how under\nphysiological oxygen levels the cells evolve to a differentiated phenotype and\nunder low oxygen level (i.e., hypoxia) they de-differentiate. Under normoxia,\nthe proportion of cancer stem cells is typically negligible and the tumour may\nultimately become extinct whereas under hypoxia cancer stem cells comprise a\ndominant proportion of the tumour volume, enhancing radio-resistance and\nfavouring the tumour's long-term survival. We then investigate how such\nphenotypic heterogeneity impacts the tumour's response to treatment with\nradiotherapy under normoxia and hypoxia. Of particular interest is establishing\nhow the presence of radio-resistant cancer stem cells can facilitate a tumour's\nregrowth following radiotherapy. We also use the model to show how\nradiation-induced changes in tumour oxygen levels can give rise to complex\nre-growth dynamics. For example, transient periods of hypoxia induced by damage\nto tumour blood vessels may rescue the cancer cell population from extinction\nand drive secondary regrowth.

The direction of cell velocity is changed according to stochastic\nrules mimicking a dense fluid. We develop a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm\ninspired from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method initially used\nfor dilute gases. The evolution of an initially localized tumor is analyzed.\nQualitatively different behaviors are observed as the field regulating activity\nfluctuations decreases. For high field values, i.e. efficient thermalization,\ncancer is controlled. For small field values, cancer rapidly and monotonously\nescapes from immunosurveillance. For the critical field value separating these\ntwo domains, the 3E's of immunotherapy are reproduced, with an apparent initial\nelimination of cancer, a long quasi-equilibrium period followed by large\nfluctuations, and the final escape of cancer, even for a favored production of\nimmune system cells. For field values slightly smaller than the critical value,\nmore regular oscillations of the number of immune system cells are\nspontaneously observed in agreement with clinical observations.

As the cell number increases\nand cell size decreases, the cells contacted to the eggshell become closer to\neach other along with harder lateral compression, and a cell that internalizes\ncould effectively increase the cell neighbor distance and lower the potential\nenergy of the system. The multicellular structure transits from single- to\ndouble-layer spontaneously with bistable states existing from 15- to 44-cell\nstages, near the gastrulation timing in vivo. Specifically, the cells with a\nlarger size or placed near a smaller-curvature boundary are easier to\ninternalize.

Current understanding of RhoA\nactivity in cell migration has been largely derived from studies of cells\nplated on a two-dimensional (2D) substrate using a FRET biosensor. There has\nbeen increasing evidence that cells behave differently in a more\nphysiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) environment, however, studies\nof RhoA activities in 3D have been hindered by low signal-to-noise ratio in\nfluorescence imaging. In this paper, we present a machine learning-assisted\nFRET technique to follow the spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activities of\nsingle breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) migrating in a 3D as well as a 2D\nenvironment using a RhoA biosensor.

Several mathematical approaches have been proposed to\nmodel the coupling of both processes, where one of the most successful methods\nrelies on a phase field that encodes the morphology of the cell, together with\nthe integration of partial differential equations that account for the\npolarization mechanism inside the cell domain as defined by the phase field.\nThis approach has been previously employed to model the motion of single cells\nof the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a widely used model organism to\nstudy actin-driven motility and chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells. Besides single\ncell motility, Dictyostelium discoideum is also well-known for its collective\nbehavior. Here, we extend the previously introduced model for single cell\nmotility to describe the collective motion of large populations of interacting\namoebae by including repulsive interactions between the cells. We performed\nnumerical simulations of this model, first characterizing the motion of single\ncells in terms of their polarity and velocity vectors. We then systematically\nstudied the collisions between two cells that provided the basic interaction\nscenarios also observed in larger ensembles of interacting amoebae. Finally,\nthe relevance of the cell density was analyzed, revealing a systematic decrease\nof the motility with density, associated with the formation of transient cell\nclusters that emerge in this system. This model is a prototypical active matter\nsystem for the investigation of the emergent collective dynamics of deformable,\nself-driven cells with a highly complex, nonlinear coupling of cell shape\ndeformations, self-propulsion and repulsive cell-cell interactions.\n",

We consider\nattractant concentration with strong and weak spatial gradient. During the\nuphill and downhill motion of the cell along the gradient, we measure the\ntemporal variation of average methylation level of the receptor clusters. Our\nnumerical simulations show that the methylation dynamics depends sensitively on\nthe size of the receptor clusters and also on the strength of the gradient. At\nshort times after the beginning of a run, the methylation dynamics is mainly\ncontrolled by short runs which are generally associated with high receptor\nactivity. This results in demethylation at short times. But for intermediate or\nlarge times, long runs play an important role and depending on receptor\ncooperativity or gradient strength, the qualitative variation of methylation\ncan be completely different in this time regime. For weak gradient, both for\nuphill and downhill runs, after the initial demethylation, we find methylation\nlevel increases steadily with time for all cluster sizes. Similar qualitative\nbehavior is observed for strong gradient during uphill runs as well. However,\nthe methylation dynamics for downhill runs in strong gradient show highly\nnon-trivial dependence on the receptor cluster size.

Cells interact with each other via the formation of\nprotrusions or filopodia and they adhere to other cells through binding of cell\nsurface proteins. The resulting adhesive forces are then related to cell size\nand shape and, often, continuum models represent them by nonlocal attractive\ninteractions. In this paper, we present a new continuum model of cell-cell\nadhesion which can be derived from a general nonlocal model in the limit of\nshort-range interactions. This new model is local, resembling a system of\nthin-film type equations, with the various model parameters playing the role of\nsurface tensions between different cell populations. Numerical simulations in\none and two dimensions reveal that the local model maintains the diversity of\ncell sorting patterns observed both in experiments and in previously used\nnonlocal models.

Volvocine algae are models for this\ntransition, as they span from the unicellular biflagellate Chlamydomonas to\nmulticellular species of Volvox with up to 50,000 Chlamydomonas-like cells on\nthe surface of a spherical extracellular matrix. The mechanism of phototaxis in\nthese species is of particular interest since they lack a nervous system and\nintercellular connections; steering is a consequence of the response of\nindividual cells to light. Studies of Volvox and Gonium, a 16-cell organism\nwith a plate-like structure, have shown that the flagellar response to changing\nillumination of the cellular photosensor is adaptive, with a recovery time\ntuned to the rotation period of the colony around its primary axis. Here,\ncombining high-resolution studies of the flagellar photoresponse with 3D\ntracking of freely-swimming cells, we show that such tuning also underlies\nphototaxis of Chlamydomonas. A mathematical model is developed based on the\nrotations around an axis perpendicular to the flagellar beat plane that occur\nthrough the adaptive response to oscillating light levels as the organism\nspins. Exploiting a separation of time scales between the flagellar\nphotoresponse and phototurning, we develop an equation of motion that\naccurately describes the observed photoalignment. In showing that the adaptive\ntime scale is tuned to the organisms' rotational period across three orders of\nmagnitude in cell number, our results suggest a unified picture of phototaxis\nin green algae in which the asymmetry in torques that produce phototurns arise\nfrom the individual flagella of Chlamydomonas, the flagellated edges of Gonium\nand the flagellated hemispheres of Volvox.\n",

On the other hand, in the case of\nclosely adjacent cells, effectively performing collective migration, the leader\ncell moves $12\\%$ faster since the follower cell pushes it. This work shows\nthat mechanical interactions between cells can increase the net transmigration\nspeed of cancer cells, resulting in increased invasiveness.

We hypothesize environmental signals are transmitted into the cell\nby ion fluxes along pre-existing gradients through gated ion-specific membrane\nchannels. The consequent changes of cytoplasmic ion concentration can generate\na local response and orchestrate global or regional responses through wire-like\nion fluxes along pre-existing and self-assembling cytoskeleton to engage the\nendoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nucleus.\n  Here, we frame our hypothesis through a quasi-physical (Cell-Reservoir) model\nthat treats intra-cellular ion-based information dynamics as a sub-cellular\nprocess permitting spatiotemporally resolved cellular response that is also\ncapable of learning complex nonlinear dynamical cellular behavior. We\ndemonstrate the proposed ion dynamics permits rapid dissemination of response\nto information extrinsic perturbations that is consistent with experimental\nobservations.\n",

Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in\nprinciple possess more information about the electric field direction when\ntheir long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields\nmaximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower\nvariability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field.

        "summary": "  Bacterial cells use run-and-tumble motion to climb up attractant\nconcentration gradient in their environment. By extending the uphill runs and\nshortening the downhill runs the cells migrate towards the higher attractant\nzones. Motivated by this, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm\nwhere an agent moves in one dimension in the presence of an attractant\ngradient. The agent can perform two actions: either persistent motion in the\nsame direction or reversal of direction. We assign costs for these actions\nbased on the recent history of the agent's trajectory. We ask the question:\nwhich RL strategy works best in different types of attractant environment. We\nquantify efficiency of the RL strategy by the ability of the agent (a) to\nlocalize in the favorable zones after large times, and (b) to learn about its\ncomplete environment. Depending on the attractant profile and the initial\ncondition, we find an optimum balance is needed between exploration and\nexploitation to ensure the most efficient performance.\n",

Near the critical density a complex picture\nemerges with interacting clusters of cells moving in groups. Motivated by these\nexperiments we have constructed a flocking model that exhibits a continuous\ntransition to the ordered phase, while assuming only short-range interactions\nand no explicit information about the knowledge of the directions of motion of\nneighbors.

Using a\nsimple purely hydrodynamic model that incorporates a stroke cycle and an\nintrinsic Gaussian white noise, we show that a stochastic run-and-tumble\nbehavior could emerge, due to the nonlinearity of the combined\nsynchronization-rotation-translation dynamics.

A number of general principles have been established.\nThe interactions at the level of cells are quite different from those among\nindividual animals therefore the study of collective motion of cells is likely\nto reveal some specific important features which are overviewed in this paper.\nIn addition to presenting the most appealing results from the quickly growing\nrelated literature we also deliver a critical discussion of the emerging\npicture and summarize our present understanding of collective motion at the\ncellular level. Collective motion of cells plays an essential role in a number\nof experimental and real-life situations. In most cases the coordinated motion\nis a helpful aspect of the given phenomenon and results in making a related\nprocess more efficient (e.g., embryogenesis or wound healing), while in the\ncase of tumor cell invasion it appears to speed up the progression of the\ndisease. In these mechanisms cells both have to be motile and adhere to one\nanother, the adherence feature being the most specific to this sort of\ncollective behavior. One of the central aims of this review is both presenting\nthe related experimental observations and treating them in the light of a few\nbasic computational models so as to make an interpretation of the phenomena at\na quantitative level as well.\n",

It presents a bridge between the\nfields of molecular communication and microscopic game theory. Molecular\ncommunication uses conventional communication engineering theory and techniques\nto study and design systems that use chemical molecules as information\ncarriers. Microscopic game theory models interactions within and between\npopulations of cells and microorganisms. Integrating these two fields provides\nunique opportunities to understand and control microscopic populations that\nhave imperfect signal propagation. Two examples, namely bacteria quorum sensing\nand tumour cell signalling, are presented with potential games to demonstrate\nthe application of this approach. Finally, a case study of bacteria resource\nsharing demonstrates how noisy signalling can alter the distribution of\nbehaviour.\n",

        "summary": "  Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development\nand homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and\ntumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which\ndescribes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual\ncell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many\nphysiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of\ncontact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance\nof cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is\nstill debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as\nnumerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell\nensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact\ninhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a\nminimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by\nextending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells\nduring growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous\nin-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a\nsystematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell\ndynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of\nemergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective\ncell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the\ntransition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent\nregime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the\nvolume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only\ninter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a\nsize-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed\ncontact inhibition.\n",
