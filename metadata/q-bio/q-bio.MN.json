Analysis of a\nmodel of gene interactions based on differential equations showed that\nwild-type expression patterns of these genes can be obtained for a wide range\nof kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by\nthe topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between\ncomponents, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we\npropose and analyze a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary\nON/OFF representation of transcription and protein levels, and in which the\ninteractions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and\ntemporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the\nnetwork and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute\nlevels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their\ninteractions. The model is able to reproduce the wild type gene expression\npatterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in\nover-expression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute\nexplicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of\nattraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the\nfunctioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of\nthe wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct\nerrors in the prepattern.\n",

Often pairs of models can reproduce these features with\nindistinguishable fidelity despite being generated by vastly different\nmechanisms. In such cases, these few target features are insufficient to\ndistinguish which of the different models best describes real world networks of\ninterest; moreover, it is not clear a priori that any of the presently-existing\nalgorithms for network generation offers a predictive description of the\nnetworks inspiring them.

In biochemical networks, the concentrations of\nthe components are often low. This means that the discrete nature of the\nreactants and the stochastic character of their interactions have to be taken\ninto account. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the components can be of\ncrucial importance. However, the current numerical techniques for simulating\nbiochemical networks either ignore the particulate nature of matter or treat\nthe spatial fluctuations in a mean-field manner. We have developed a new\ntechnique, called Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD), that makes it\npossible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in both\ntime and space. In this scheme, a maximum time step is chosen such that only\nsingle particles or pairs of particles have to be considered. For these\nparticles, the Smoluchowski equation can be solved analytically using Green's\nfunctions. The main idea of GFRD is to exploit the exact solution of the\nSmoluchoswki equation to set up an event-driven algorithm. This allows GFRD to\nmake large jumps in time when the particles are far apart from each other.\nHere, we apply the technique to a simple model of gene expression. The\nsimulations reveal that the scheme is highly efficient.

Nevertheless, a quantitative analysis of the\ntopological properties of an immunological network involving this complex\ninterchange of mediators among immune cells is still lacking. Here we present a\nmethod for quantifying the relevance of different mediators in the immune\nnetwork, which exploits a definition of centrality based on the concept of\nefficient communication. The analysis, applied to the human immune system,\nindicates that its mediators significantly differ in their network relevance.\nWe found that cytokines involved in innate immunity and inflammation and some\nhormones rank highest in the network, revealing that the most prominent\nmediators of the IS are molecules involved in these ancestral types of defence\nmechanisms highly integrated with the adaptive immune response, and at the\ninterplay among the nervous, the endocrine and the immune systems.\n",

In order to determine the stability of the genetic switches, we\nmake a connection with reactive flux theory and transition state theory. The\nswitch stability is characterised by a well defined lifetime $\\tau$. We find\nthat $\\tau$ grows exponentially with the mean number $\\Nmean$ of transcription\nfactor molecules involved in the switching. In the regime accessible to direct\nnumerical simulations, the growth law is well characterised by\n$\\tau\\sim\\Nmean{}^{\\alpha}\\exp(b\\Nmean)$, where $\\alpha$ and $b$ are\nparameters. The switch stability is decreased by phenomena that increase the\nnoise in gene expression, such as the production of multiple copies of a\nprotein from a single mRNA transcript (shot noise), and fluctuations in the\nnumber of proteins produced per transcript. However, robustness against\nbiochemical noise can be drastically enhanced by arranging the transcription\nfactor binding domains on the DNA such that competing transcription factors\nmutually exclude each other on the DNA. We also elucidate the origin of the\nenhanced stability of the exclusive switch with respect to that of the general\nswitch: while the kinetic prefactor is roughly the same for both switches, the\n`barrier' for flipping the switch is significantly higher for the exclusive\nswitch than for the general switch.\n",

Intriguingly, it has been observed\nin numerous developmental contexts, and particularly hematopoiesis, that genes\nregulating differentiation are initially co-expressed in progenitors despite\ntheir antagonism, before one is upregulated and others downregulated. We\ncharacterise conditions under which 3 classes of generic \"master regulatory\nnetworks\", modelled at the molecular level after experimentally-observed\ninteractions (including bHLH protein dimerisation), and including an arbitrary\nnumber of antagonistic components, can behave as a \"multi-switch\", directing\ndifferentiation in an all-or-none fashion to a specific cell-type chosen among\nmore than 2 possible outcomes. bHLH dimerisation networks can readily display\ncoexistence of many antagonistic factors when competition is low (a simple\ncharacterisation is derived). Decision-making can be forced by a transient\nincrease in competition, which could correspond to some unexplained\nexperimental observations related to Id proteins; the speed of response varies\nwith the initial conditions the network is subjected to, which could explain\nsome aspects of cell behaviour upon reprogramming. The coexistence of\nantagonistic factors at low levels, early in the differentiation process or in\npluripotent stem cells, could be an intrinsic property of the interaction\nbetween those factors, not requiring a specific regulatory system.\n",

We propose here that the increasing complexity of protein-protein\ninteractions has driven the selection of longer proteins, as longer proteins\nare more able to distinguish among a larger number of distinct interactions due\nto their greater average surface area. Annotated protein sequences available\nfrom the SWISS-PROT database were analyzed for thirteen eukaryotes, eight\nbacteria, and two archaea species. The number of subcellular locations to which\neach protein is associated is used as a measure of the number of interactions\nto which a protein participates. Two databases of yeast protein-protein\ninteractions were used as another measure of the number of interactions to\nwhich each \\emph{S. cerevisiae} protein participates. Protein length is shown\nto correlate with both number of subcellular locations to which a protein is\nassociated and number of interactions as measured by yeast two-hybrid\nexperiments. Protein length is also shown to correlate with the probability\nthat the protein is encoded by an essential gene. Interestingly, average\nprotein length and number of subcellular locations are not significantly\ndifferent between all human proteins and protein targets of known, marketed\ndrugs. Increased protein length appears to be a significant mechanism by which\nthe increasing complexity of protein-protein interaction networks is\naccommodated within the natural evolution of species.

In the metabolic networks of\nE. coli, S. cerevisiae and S. aureus, we identified metabolites with a low\ndegree of connectivity, particularly those that are produced and/or consumed in\njust a single reaction.

Subgraph centrality gives important structural information about the\nrole of individual proteins and permits the selection of possible targets for\nrational drug discovery through the identification of essential proteins in the\nPIN.\n",

While the degree distribution does\nnot capture all aspects of a network, it has often been suggested that its\nfunctional form contains important clues as to underlying evolutionary\nprocesses that have shaped the network. Generally, the functional form for the\ndegree distribution has been determined in an ad-hoc fashion, with clear\npower-law like behaviour often only extending over a limited range of\nconnectivities. Here we apply formal model selection techniques to decide which\nprobability distribution best describes the degree distributions of protein\ninteraction networks. Contrary to previous studies this well defined approach\nsuggests that the degree distribution of many molecular networks is often\nbetter described by distributions other than the popular power-law\ndistribution. This, in turn, suggests that simple, if elegant, models may not\nnecessarily help in the quantitative understanding of complex biological\nprocesses.\\\n",

The\nidentity of the rate-limiting step for this slow response can be inferred from\nthe initial yields and specific growth rates measured by exposing steady state\ncultures at various dilution rates to substrate-excess conditions. We measured\nthese parameters for glucose-limited cultures of E. coli ML308 growing at\nvarious dilution rates between 0.03 and 0.6 1/hr. In all the cases, the initial\nyields were 20-30% less than the steady state yields. The decline of the yield\nimplies that overflow metabolism is triggered in response to excess glucose. It\nis therefore unlikely that the initial response of the cells is limited by\nsubstrate uptake. The initial specific growth rates of cultures growing at low\ndilution rates (D = 0.03, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.3 1/hr) were significantly higher\nthan the steady state specific growth rates. However, the increment in the\nspecific growth rate decreased with the dilution rate, and at D=0.6 1/hr, there\nwas no improvement in the specific growth rate. The initial specific growth\nrates varied hyperbolically with the dilution, decreasing sharply at dilution\nrates below 0.1 1/hr and saturating at D=0.6 1/hr.

Despite this dynamic similarity,\nthe models vary with respect to the range of dynamics captured. The Brandt et\nal model captures only the diauxic growth pattern, whereas the remaining two\nmodels capture both diauxic and non-diauxic growth patterns. The models also\ndiffer with respect to the mechanisms that generate the mutual inhibition\nbetween the enzymes. In the Narang model, the mutual inhibition occurs because\nthe enzymes for each substrate enhance the dilution of the enzymes for the\nother substrate.

In response to signals\nsuch as DNA damage, p53 controls the transcription of a series of genes that\ncause cell cycle arrest during which DNA damage is repaired, or triggers\nprogrammed cell death that eliminates possibly cancerous cells wherein DNA\ndamage might have remained unrepaired. Previous experiments showed oscillations\nin p53 level in response to DNA damage, but the mechanism of oscillation\nremained unclear. Here we examine a model where the concentrations of p53\nisoforms are regulated by Mdm22, Arf, Siah, and beta-catenin. The extent of DNA\ndamage is signalled through the switch-like activity of a DNA damage sensor,\nthe DNA-dependent protein kinase Atm. This switch is responsible for initiating\nand terminating oscillations in p53 concentration. The strength of the DNA\ndamage signal modulates the number of oscillatory waves of p53 and Mdm22 but\nnot the frequency or amplitude of oscillations{a result that recapitulates\nexperimental findings. A critical fnding was that the phosphorylated form of\nNbs11, a member of the DNA break repair complex Mre11-Rad50-Nbs11 (MRN), must\naugment the activity of Atm kinase. While there is in vitro support for this\nassumption, this activity appears essential for p53 dynamics. The model\nprovides several predictions concerning, among others, degradation of the\nphosphorylated form of p53, the rate of DNA repair as a function of DNA damage,\nthe sensitivity of p53 oscillation to transcription rates of SIAH, beta-CATENIN\nand ARF, and the hysteretic behavior of active Atm kinase levels with respect\nto the DNA damage signal\n",

Network decomposition of three microbes (Escherichia coli, Aeropyrum\npernix and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) shows that almost all of the sub-networks\nexhibit a highly modularized bow-tie topological pattern similar to that of the\nglobal metabolic networks. Moreover, these small bow-ties are hierarchically\nnested into larger ones and collectively integrated into a large metabolic\nnetwork, and important features of this modularity are not observed in the\nrandom shuffled network. In addition, such a bow-tie pattern appears to be\npresent in certain chemically isolated functional modules and spatially\nseparated modules including carbohydrate metabolism, cytosol and mitochondrion\nrespectively. The highly modularized bow-tie pattern is present at different\nlevels and scales, and in different chemical and spatial modules of metabolic\nnetworks, which is likely the result of the evolutionary process rather than a\nrandom accident. Identification and analysis of such a pattern is helpful for\nunderstanding the design principles and facilitate the modelling of metabolic\nnetworks.\n",

We explored factors affecting the\ndose-response curves of this pathway and found that both negative feedback and\nconcentrations of the proteins involved in the MAPK cascade play crucial role.\nContrary to some other MAPK systems where signaling sensitivity is being\namplified successively along the cascade, here the mating signal is transmitted\nthrough the cascade in an almost linear fashion.\n",

Our circuit is of the same size as\nthe well-known genetic toggle switch (an unconditional latch) which consists of\ntwo mutually repressing genes, but is complemented with a \"regulatory front\nend\" involving protein heterodimerization as a simple way to implement\nconditional control. Deterministic and stochastic analysis of the circuit\ndynamics indicate that an experimental implementation is feasible based on\nwell-characterized genes and proteins. It is not known, to which extent\nmolecular networks are able to conditionally store information in natural\ncontexts for bacteria. However, our results suggest that such sequential logic\nelements may be readily implemented by cells through the combination of\nexisting protein-protein interactions and simple transcriptional regulation.\n",

While some RNAs are\nessential for embryogenesis, others are limited to fine-tuning a predetermined\ngene expression pattern. Here we explore the possibility that small RNAs\nparticipate in sharpening a gene expression profile that was crudely\nestablished by a morphogen. To this end we study a model where small RNAs\ninteract with a target gene and diffusively move from cell to cell.

We\nshow that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic\nfluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even\nwithout specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in\nprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and\ndegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an\nadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.\nUnder the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less\naffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are\nlarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells\nare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a\ncellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This\nleads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model\nsimulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results\nsuggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a\nprocess that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation.

First, our analysis allows us to\nidentify a bimodal activity depending of the strength of self-repression\ncoupling D. In the strong coupling region D>>1, the variance of the\ntranscriptional noise is found to be reduced a 28 % more than described\nearlier. Secondly, the contribution of the noise effect to the abundance of\nregulating protein becomes manifest when the coefficient of variation is\ncomputed. In the strong coupling region, this coefficient is found to be\nindependent of all parameters and in fair agreement with the experimentally\nobserved values. Finally, our analysis reveals that the regulating protein is\nsignificantly induced by the intrinsic and external noise in the strong\ncoupling region. In short, it indicates that the existence of inherent noise in\nFBL makes it possible to produce a basal amount of proteins even though the\nrepression level D is very strong.\n",

The number of functionally unclassified\nproteins is large even for simple and well studied organisms such as baker's\nyeast.

Since\nproteins aggregate to perform a certain function, analyzing structural\nproperties of PPI networks may provide useful clues about the biological\nfunction of individual proteins, protein complexes they participate in, and\neven larger subcellular machines.\n  We design a sensitive graph theoretic method for comparing local structures\nof node neighborhoods that demonstrates that in PPI networks, biological\nfunction of a node and its local network structure are closely related. The\nmethod groups topologically similar proteins under this measure in a PPI\nnetwork and shows that these protein groups belong to the same protein\ncomplexes, perform the same biological functions, are localized in the same\nsubcellular compartments, and have the same tissue expressions.

The\ninvestigation of such systems with classical mathematical tools, such as\ndifferential equations for their dynamics, is not always suitable. The graph\ntheoretical models may serve as a rough but powerful tool in such cases. In\nthis thesis, I first consider the network modeling for the representation of\nthe biological systems. Both the topological and dynamical investigation tools\nare developed and applied to the various model networks. In particular, the\nattractor features' scaling with system size and distributions are explored for\nmodel networks. Moreover, the theoretical robustness expressions are discussed\nand computational studies are done for confirmation. The main biological\nresearch in this thesis is to investigate the transcriptional regulation of\ngene expression with synchronously and deterministically updated Boolean\nnetwork models. I explore the attractor structure and the robustness of the\nknown interaction network of the yeast, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and compare\nwith the model networks. Furthermore, I discuss a recent model claiming a\npossible root to the topology of the yeast's gene regulation network and\ninvestigate this model dynamically. The thesis also included another study\nwhich investigates a relation between folding kinetics with a new network\nrepresentation, namely, the incompatibility network of a protein's native\nstructure. I showed that the conventional topological aspects of these networks\nare not statistically correlated with the phi-values, for the limited data that\nis available.\n",

This is especially true in the field of chemical reactions where the\nabilities to form bonds between different types of atoms and molecules create\nmuch of the properties we experience in our everyday life, especially in all\nbiological activity. There are essentially two types of processes related to\nbiochemical reaction networks, the interactions among molecules and\ninteractions involving their conformational changes, so in a sense, their\ninternal state. The first type of processes can be conveniently approximated by\nthe so-called mass-action kinetics, but this is not necessarily so for the\nsecond kind where molecular states do not define any kind of density or\nconcentration. In this paper we demonstrate the necessity to study reaction\nnetworks in a stochastic formulation for which we can construct a coherent\napproximation in terms of specific space-time scales and the number of\nparticles. The continuum limit procedure naturally creates equations of\nFokker-Planck type where the evolution of the concentration occurs on a slower\ntime scale when compared to the evolution of the conformational changes, for\nexample triggered by binding or unbinding events with other (typically smaller)\nmolecules. We apply the asymptotic theory to derive the effective, i.e.\nmacroscopic dynamics of the biochemical reaction system. The theory can also be\napplied to other processes where entities can be described by finitely many\ninternal states, with changes of states occuring by arrival of other entities\ndescribed by a birth-death process.\n",

The classical approaches\nthrough the computation of the right null space leads to the decomposition of\nthe network into complex ``cycles'' of reactions concerned with all\nmetabolites. We show how, departing from the left null space computation, the\nflux analysis can be decoupled into linear fluxes and single loops, allowing a\nmore refine qualitative analysis as a function of the antagonisms and\nconnections among these local fluxes. This analysis is made possible by the\ndecomposition of the molecules into elementary subunits, called \"reactons\" and\nthe consequent decomposition of the whole network into simple first order unary\npartial reactions related with simple transfers of reactons from one molecule\nto another. This article explains and justifies the algorithmic steps leading\nto the total decomposition of the reaction network into its constitutive\nelementary subpart.\n",

As such they\nare amenable to methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics used in our study.\nWe investigate the effects of network connectivity on these fluctuations and\ncompare them to their upper and lower bounds. The collective effects are shown\nto sometimes lead to large power-law distributed amplification of spontaneous\nfluctuations as compared to the expectation for isolated dimers. As a\nconsequence of this, the strength of both types of fluctuations is positively\ncorrelated with the overall network connectivity of proteins forming the\ncomplex.

Its signal-response curve appears sigmoidal, constituting a\nbiochemical switch. However, the switch behavior only emerges in the\n\"zero-order region\", i.e. when the signal molecule concentration is much lower\nthan that of the substrate it modifies. In this work we showed that the\nswitching behavior can also occur under comparable concentrations of signals\nand substrates, provided that the signal molecules catalyze the modification\nreaction in cooperation. We also studied the effect of dynamic disorders on the\nproposed biochemical switch, in which the enzymatic reaction rates, instead of\nconstant, appear as stochastic functions of time. We showed that the system is\nrobust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder\nis quasi-static, large fluctuations of the switch response behavior may be\nobserved at low concentrations. Such fluctuation is relevant to many biological\nfunctions. It can be reduced by either increasing the conformation\ninterconversion rate of the protein, or correlating the enzymatic reaction\nrates in the network.\n",

Comparison and alignment of\nbiological networks will likely have a similar impact. Existing network\nalignments use information external to the networks, such as sequence, because\nno good algorithm for purely topological alignment has yet been devised. In\nthis paper, we present a novel algorithm based solely on network topology, that\ncan be used to align any two networks. We apply it to biological networks to\nproduce by far the most complete topological alignments of biological networks\nto date.

Our alignment of the\nprotein-protein interaction networks of two very different species--yeast and\nhuman--indicate that even distant species share a surprising amount of network\ntopology with each other, suggesting broad similarities in internal cellular\nwiring across all life on Earth.\n",

While many other network analysis methods based\non random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our\nearlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes.\nIn addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier\nformalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow\nthat yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein\nfunctions and pathways. However, the directed flow from origins to destinations\nwas induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a\ntheoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier\nwork for directed information flow. This is achieved by constructing a\npotential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the\nchannel mode. For each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of\nemitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a\nchannel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be\ninterpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a\ndestination. Similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses\ndamping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow.\nThrough examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate\nthe versatility and stability of our new framework.\n",

For technical reasons, comparing large networks is\ncomputationally infeasible, and thus heuristics such as the degree distribution\nhave been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by\nsimply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much\nharder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating\ntheir similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is\ncomputationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger\nthe number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more\nlikely it is that the networks will truly be similar.\n  We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that\nimposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In\nparticular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of\nnodes 'touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes\n'touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic\nsubgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure\nconsists of 73 graphlet degree distributions (GDDs) of graphlets with 2-5\nnodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e.\ngraphlets). Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 GDDs into a network\n'agreement' measure. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that\nalmost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, are better\nmodeled by geometric random graphs than by Erdos-Reny, random scale-free, or\nBarabasi-Albert scale-free networks.\n",

The model rationalizes an unexpected poor correlation between the\nmid-point of in vivo promoter activity profiles and in vitro equilibrium\nconstants for MarA binding to promoter sequences. Analysis of the promoter\nactivity data using the model yielded the following predictions regarding\nactivation mechanisms: (1) MarA activation of the marRAB, sodA, and micF\npromoters involves a net acceleration of the kinetics of transitions after RNA\npolymerase binding, up to and including promoter escape and message elongation;\n(2) RNA polymerase binds to these promoters with nearly unit occupancy in the\nabsence of MarA, making recruitment of polymerase an insignificant factor in\nactivation of these promoters; and (3) instead of recruitment, activation of\nthe micF promoter might involve a repulsion of polymerase combined with a large\nacceleration of the kinetics of polymerase activity. These predictions are\nconsistent with published chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of interactions\nbetween polymerase and the E. coli chromosome. A lack of recruitment in\ntranscriptional activation represents an exception to the textbook description\nof activation of bacterial sigma-70 promoters.

However, existing gene network models\ndo not explain more complex properties of cell fate dynamics such as the\nhierarchical branching of developmental paths. Here, we construct a generic\nminimal model of the genetic regulatory network controlling cell fate\ndetermination, which exhibits five elementary characteristics of cell\ndifferentiation: stability, directionality, branching, exclusivity, and\npromiscuous expression. We argue that a modular architecture comprising\nrepeated network elements reproduces these features of differentiation by\nsequentially repressing selected modules and hence restricting the dynamics to\nlower dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional state space. We implement\nour model both with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to explore the role\nof bifurcations in producing the one-way character of differentiation, and with\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs), to demonstrate the effect of noise on\nthe system. We further argue that binary cell fate decisions are prevalent in\ncell differentiation due to general features of the underlying dynamical\nsystem.

The precision of this control is\nlimited by the inevitable randomness of individual molecular events. Here we\nexplore how cells can maximize their control power in the presence of these\nphysical limits; formally, we solve the theoretical problem of maximizing the\ninformation transferred from inputs to outputs when the number of available\nmolecules is held fixed. We start with the simplest version of the problem, in\nwhich a single transcription factor protein controls the readout of one or more\ngenes by binding to DNA. We further simplify by assuming that this regulatory\nnetwork operates in steady state, that the noise is small relative to the\navailable dynamic range, and that the target genes do not interact. Even in\nthis simple limit, we find a surprisingly rich set of optimal solutions.\nImportantly, for each locally optimal regulatory network, all parameters are\ndetermined once the physical constraints on the number of available molecules\nare specified. Although we are solving an over--simplified version of the\nproblem facing real cells, we see parallels between the structure of these\noptimal solutions and the behavior of actual genetic regulatory networks.\nSubsequent papers will discuss more complete versions of the problem.\n",

An exceptionally large\ndynamically relevant core network found in Yeast in comparison with the second\nensemble points to a strong bias towards a collective organization which is\nachieved by subtle modifications in the network's degree distributions. We use\na Boolean model of regulatory dynamics with various classes of update functions\nto represent in vivo regulatory interactions.

Almaas et al have shown that the flux distribution\nfollows a power law, and it is possible to associate with most metabolites two\nreactions which maximally produce and consume a give metabolite, respectively.\nThis observation led to the concept of high-flux backbone (HFB) in metabolic\nnetworks.

In this paper, we investigate the conservation of HFB of a\nparticular solution for a given medium across different alternate optima and\nnear-optima in metabolic networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Using flux\nvariability analysis (FVA), we propose a method to determine reactions that are\nguaranteed to be in HFB regardless of alternate solutions. We find that the HFB\nof a particular optima is largely conserved across alternate optima in E. coli,\nwhile it is only moderately conserved in S. cerevisiae. However, the HFB of a\nparticular near-optima shows a large variation across alternate near-optima in\nboth organisms.

A well-known example is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\ncascade, where in each layer of the cascade a protein is phosphorylated at two\nsites. It has long been known that the response of a MAPK pathway strongly\ndepends on whether the enzymes that modify the protein act processively or\ndistributively: distributive mechanism, in which the enzyme molecules have to\nrelease the substrate molecules in between the modification of the two sites,\ncan generate an ultrasensitive response and lead to hysteresis and bistability.\nWe study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics, a stochastic scheme that makes\nit possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in time\nand space, a dual phosphorylation cycle in which the enzymes act according to a\ndistributive mechanism. We find that the response of this network can differ\ndramatically from that predicted by a mean-field analysis based on the chemical\nrate equations. In particular, rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the\nsubstrate molecules after modification of the first site can markedly speed up\nthe response, and lead to loss of ultrasensitivity and bistability. In essence,\nrapid enzyme-substrate rebindings can turn a distributive mechanism into a\nprocessive mechanism.

By choosing specific regulatory interactions with up\nto three transcription factors, we designed several functional motifs, each of\nwhich is shown to perform a certain function and can be integrated into larger\nnetworks. We analyzed three kinds of networks: (i) Motifs derived from\nincoherent feedforward motifs, which behave as `amplitude filters', or\n`concentration detectors'.

These complex dynamics can be modeled using Boolean networks,\nallowing us to explain the existence of different cell states and the\ntransition between them. Boolean models have been introduced both as specific\nexamples and as ensemble or distribution network models. However, current\nensemble Boolean network models do not make a systematic distinction between\ndifferent cell components such as epigenetic factors, gene and transcription\nfactors. Consequently, we still do not understand their relative contributions\nin controlling the cell fate. In this work we introduce and study higher order\nBoolean networks, which feature an explicit distinction between the different\ncell components and the types of interactions between them. We show that the\nstability of the cell state dynamics can be determined solving the eigenvalue\nproblem of a matrix representing the regulatory interactions and their\nstrengths. The qualitative analysis of this problem indicates that, in addition\nto the classification into stable and chaotic regimes, the cell state can be\nsimple or complex depending on whether it can be deduced from the independent\nstudy of its components or not.

In our point of view this approach is too restrictive, as, one the\none hand, due to predominant parameter uncertainty numerical methods are\ngenerally difficult to apply to realistic models originating in Systems\nBiology. And on the other hand switching already arises with the occurrence of\na saddle type steady state (characterized by a Jacobian where exactly one\nEigenvalue is positive and the remaining eigenvalues have negative real part).\nConsequently we derive conditions based on linear inequalities that allow the\nanalytic computation of states and parameters where the Jacobian derived from a\nmass action network has a defective zero eigenvalue so that -- under certain\ngenericity conditions -- a saddle-node bifurcation occurs. Our conditions are\napplicable to general mass action networks involving at least one conservation\nrelation, however, they are only sufficient (as infeasibility of linear\ninequalities does not exclude defective zero eigenvalues).\n",

In particular a precise\nadaptive response, where system activity is maintained at a constant level at\nsteady state, does not ensure a large dynamic range neither in input signal nor\nin system output.

We find that a protein phosphorylation\ncycle by itself is robust when protein turnover is low. For high decay or\ndilution rates (and co mpensating synthesis rate), however, the\nphosphorylation-based oscillator loses its integrity. Circadian rhythms thus\ncannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate,\nand consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a\npurely post-translational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling\ntime drops below the 24 hour clock period. At higher growth rates, a\ntranscription-translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust\ncircadian rhythms. Interestingly, while a transcription-translation cycle is\nnecessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a\nphosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a\ntranscription-translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. Our\nanalysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust\ncircadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.\n",

Here, by employing systems biology\napproach, we reveal a systemic virus-entry network initiated by human\ncytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread opportunistic pathogen. This network\ncontains all known interactions and functional modules (i.e. groups of\nproteins) coordinately responding to HCMV entry. The number of both genes and\nfunctional modules activated in this network dramatically declines shortly,\nwithin 25 min post-infection. While modules annotated as receptor system, ion\ntransport, and immune response are continuously activated during the entire\nprocess of HCMV entry, those for cell adhesion and skeletal movement are\nspecifically activated during viral early attachment, and those for immune\nresponse during virus entry. HCMV entry requires a complex receptor network\ninvolving different cellular components, comprising not only cell surface\nreceptors, but also pathway components in signal transduction, skeletal\ndevelopment, immune response, endocytosis, ion transport, macromolecule\nmetabolism and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, genes that function in\nchromatin remodeling are the most abundant in this receptor system, suggesting\nthat global modulation of transcriptions is one of the most important events in\nHCMV entry. Results of in silico knock out further reveal that this entire\nreceptor network is primarily controlled by multiple elements, such as EGFR\n(Epidermal Growth Factor) and SLC10A1 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter family,\nmember 1). Thus, our results demonstrate that a complex systemic network, in\nwhich components coordinating efficiently in time and space contributes to\nvirus entry.\n",

The intracellular signaling processes and their control mechanisms,\nhowever, are susceptible to both extrinsic and intrinsic noise. In this\narticle, we present numerical evidence for a universal dynamic behavior of\nNF-{\\kappa}B, namely oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, due to the\nfundamentally stochastic nature of the NF-{\\kappa}B signaling network. We\nsimulated the effect of extrinsic noise with a deterministic ODE model, using a\nstatistical ensemble approach, generating many copies of the signaling network\nwith different kinetic rates sampled from a biologically feasible parameter\nspace. We modeled the effect of intrinsic noise by simulating the same networks\nstochastically using the Gillespie algorithm. The results demonstrate that\nextrinsic noise diversifies the shuttling patterns of NF-{\\kappa}B response,\nwhereas intrinsic noise induces oscillatory behavior in many of the otherwise\nnon-oscillatory patterns.

By sampling model behaviors over the\nphysiologically realistic parameter range we find that the model exhibits only\ntwo different qualitative behaviours and these depend mainly on the relative\nprotein concentrations, which offers a powerful point of control to the cell.\nOur study highlights the necessity to characterize model behavior not for a\nsingle parameter optimum, but to identify parameter sets that characterize\ndifferent signaling modes.\n",

This\nactivation model previously demonstrated that peptide-activated PAR1 has a\ndifferent receptor/G-protein binding affinity that favors Galpha_q activation\nover Galpha_12/13 by approximately 800-fold.

However, establishing the network\ntopologies that can exhibit bistability remains a challenge, in part due to the\nexceedingly large variety of GRNs that exist for even a small number of\ncomponents. We begin to address this problem by employing chemical reaction\nnetwork theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity\nfor bistability of more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two\ntranscription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins (assuming only\nthe most elementary biochemical processes). We find that there exist reaction\nrate constants leading to bistability in ~90% of these GRN models, including\nseveral circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly\nassociated with bistable systems, and the majority of which could only be\nidentified as bistable through an original subnetwork-based analysis. A\ntopological sorting of the two-gene family of networks based on the presence or\nabsence of biochemical reactions reveals eleven minimal bistable networks\n(i.e., bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable\nsubnetwork). The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies\nsuggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with\nrelative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. To highlight\nthe relevance of the systematic application of CRNT to bistable network\nidentification in real biological systems, we integrated publicly available\nprotein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data\nfrom Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave\nin a bistable fashion.\n",

All chemical reaction systems are shaped by the\nsame physics that gives molecules their stability and affinity to react. These\nfundamental factors cannot be captured by standard null-models based on\nrandomization. The unique property of organismal metabolism is that it is\ncontrolled, to some extent, by an enzymatic machinery that is subject to\nevolution. In this paper, we explore the possibility that reaction systems of\nplanetary atmospheres can serve as a null-model against which we can define\nmetabolic structure and trace the influence of evolution. We find that the two\ntypes of data can be distinguished by their respective degree distributions.\nThis is especially clear when looking at the degree distribution of the\nreaction network (of reaction connected to each other if they involve the same\nmolecular species). For the Earth's atmospheric network and the human metabolic\nnetwork, we look into more detail for an underlying explanation of this\ndeviation. However, we cannot pinpoint a single cause of the difference, rather\nthere are several concurrent factors. By examining quantities relating to the\nmodular-functional organization of the metabolism, we confirm that metabolic\nnetworks have a more complex modular organization than the atmospheric\nnetworks, but not much more. We interpret the more variegated modular\narrangement of metabolism as a trace of evolved functionality. On the other\nhand, it is quite remarkable how similar the structures of these two types of\nnetworks are, which emphasizes that the constraints from the chemical\nproperties of the molecules has a larger influence in shaping the reaction\nsystem than does natural selection.\n",

Proteins that specialize in this function are\ncalled by a variety names, including adapter, linker and scaffold.\nScaffold-mediated nucleation of protein complexes can be either constitutive or\ninduced. Induced nucleation is commonly mediated by a docking site on a\nscaffold that is activated by phosphorylation. Here, by considering minimalist\nmathematical models, which recapitulate scaffold effects seen in more\nmechanistically detailed models, we obtain analytical and numerical results\nthat provide insights into scaffold function. These results elucidate how\nrecruitment of a pair of ligands to a scaffold depends on the concentrations of\nthe ligands, on the binding constants for ligand-scaffold interactions, on\nbinding cooperativity, and on the milieu of the scaffold, as ligand recruitment\nis affected by competitive ligands and decoy receptors. For the case of a\nbivalent scaffold, we obtain an expression for the unique scaffold\nconcentration that maximally recruits a pair of monovalent ligands. Through\nsimulations, we demonstrate that a bivalent scaffold can nucleate distinct sets\nof ligands to equivalent extents when the scaffold is present at different\nconcentrations. Thus, the function of a scaffold can potentially change\nqualitatively with a change in copy number. We also demonstrate how a scaffold\ncan change the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme and the sensitivity of the\nrate of reaction to substrate concentration.

With the aim of\nclosing this gap, we have developed PUB-MS (for Proximity Utilizing\nBiotinylation and Mass Spectrometry), an approach to monitor protein-protein\nproximity, based on biotinylation of a protein fused to a biotin-acceptor\npeptide (BAP) by a biotin-ligase, BirA, fused to its interaction partner. The\nbiotinylation status of the BAP can be further detected by either Western\nanalysis or mass spectrometry. The BAP sequence was redesigned for easy\nmonitoring of the biotinylation status by LC-MS/MS. In several experimental\nmodels, we demonstrate that the biotinylation in vivo is specifically enhanced\nwhen the BAP- and BirA- fused proteins are in proximity to each other. The\nadvantage of mass spectrometry is demonstrated by using BAPs with different\nsequences in a single experiment (allowing multiplex analysis) and by the use\nof stable isotopes. Finally, we show that our methodology can be also used to\nstudy a specific subfraction of a protein of interest that was in proximity\nwith another protein at a predefined time before the analysis.\n",

Specifically we ask\nin how far the lethality of eliminating nodes may be predicted by their network\ncentrality, such as degree and betweenness, without knowing the function of the\nsystem. The function is taken as the ability to reproduce a fixed point under a\ndiscrete Boolean dynamics. We investigate two types of stochastically generated\nnetworks: fully random networks and structures grown with a mechanism of node\nduplication and subsequent divergence of interactions. On all networks we find\nthat the out-degree is a good predictor of the lethality of a single node\nknock-out. For knock-outs of node pairs, the fraction of successors shared\nbetween the two knocked-out nodes (out-overlap) is a good predictor of\nsynthetic lethality. Out-degree and out-overlap are locally defined and\ncomputationally simple centrality measures that provide a predictive power\nclose to the optimal predictor.\n",

Apoptotic regulatory network contains several\nsignificant control points, including probably the most important one - Bcl--2\napoptotic switch. There are two proposed hypotheses regarding its internal\nworking - the indirect activation and direct activation models. Since these\nhypotheses form extreme poles of full continuum of intermediate models, we have\nconstructed more general model with these two models as extreme cases.\n  By studying relationship between model parameters and steady-state response\nultrasensitivity we have found optimal interaction pattern which reproduces\nbehavior of Bcl-2 apoptotic switch. Our results show, that stimulus-response\nultrasensitivity is negatively related to spontaneous activation of Bcl-2\neffectors - subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins. We found that ultrasensitivity requires\neffector's activation, mediated by another subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins -\nactivators. We have shown that the auto-activation of effectors forms\nultrasensitivity enhancing feedback loop, only if mediated by monomers, but not\nby oligomers. Robustness analysis revealed that interaction pattern proposed by\ndirect activation hypothesis is able to conserve stimulus-response dependence\nand preserve ultrasensitivity despite large changes of its internal parameters.\nThis ability is strongly reduced as for the intermediate to indirect side of\nthe models.\n  Computer simulation of the more general model presented here suggest, that\nstimulus-response ultrasensitivity is an emergent property of the direct\nactivation model, that cannot originate within model of indirect activation.\nIntroduction of indirect-model-specific interactions does not provide better\nexplanation of Bcl-2 functioning compared to direct model.\n",

This\nregulatory motif is active during cell differentiation and is thought to act as\na memory device, being able to choose and maintain cell fate decisions. In this\ncontribution, we study the stability and dynamics of a two-stage gene\nexpression switch within a probabilistic framework inspired by the properties\nof the Pu/Gata toggle switch in myeloid progenitor cells. We focus on low mRNA\nnumbers, high protein abundance and monomeric transcription factor binding.\nContrary to the expectation from a deterministic description, this switch shows\ncomplex multi-attractor dy- namics without autoactivation and cooperativity.\nMost importantly, the four attractors of the system, which only emerge in a\nprobabilistic two-stage description, can be identified with committed and\nprimed states in cell differentiation. We first study the dynamics of the\nsystem and infer the mechanisms that move the system between attractors using\nboth the quasi-potential and the probability flux of the system. Second, we\nshow that the residence times of the system in one of the committed attractors\nare geometrically distributed and provide an analytical expression of the\ndistribution. Most importantly we find that the mean residence time increases\nlinearly with the mean protein level. Finally, we study the implications of\nthis distribution for the stability of a switch and discuss the influence of\nthe stability on a specific cell differentiation mechanism. Our model explains\nlineage priming and proposes the need of either high protein numbers or long\nterm modifications such as chromatin remodeling to achieve stable cell fate\ndecisions.

The\nworst, same experimental systems dealing with the same pairs of mRNA and miRNA\ncan provide ambiguous evidences about which is the actual mechanism of\ntranslation repression observed in the experiment. We start with reviewing the\ncurrent knowledge of various mechanisms of miRNA action and suggest that\nmathematical modeling can help resolving some of the controversial\ninterpretations. We describe three simple mathematical models of miRNA\ntranslation that can be used as tools in interpreting the experimental data on\nthe dynamics of protein synthesis. The most complex model developed by us\nincludes all known mechanisms of miRNA action. It allowed us to study possible\ndynamical patterns corresponding to different miRNA-mediated mechanisms of\ntranslation repression and to suggest concrete recipes on determining the\ndominant mechanism of miRNA action in the form of kinetic signatures. Using\ncomputational experiments and systematizing existing evidences from the\nliterature, we justify a hypothesis about co-existence of distinct\nmiRNA-mediated mechanisms of translation repression.

        "summary": "  The identification of cellular objectives is one of the central topics in the\nresearch of microbial metabolic networks. In particular, the information about\na cellular objective is needed in flux balance analysis which is a commonly\nused constrained-based metabolic network analysis method for the prediction of\ncellular phenotypes. The cellular objective may vary depending on the organism\nand its growth conditions. It is probable that nutritionally scarce conditions\nare very common in the nature and, in order to survive in those conditions,\ncells exhibit various highly efficient nutrient processing systems like\nenzymes. In this study, we explore the efficiency of a metabolic network in\ntransformation of substrates to new biomass, and we introduce a new objective\nfunction simulating growth efficiency.\n  We examined the properties of growth efficiency using a metabolic model for\nEschericia coli. We found that the maximal growth efficiency is obtained at a\nfinite nutrient uptake rate. The rate is substrate-dependent and it typically\ndoes not exceed 20 mmol/h/gDW. We further examined whether the maximal growth\nefficiency could serve as a cellular objective function in metabolic network\nanalysis, and found that cellular growth in batch cultivation can be predicted\nreasonably well under this assumption. The fit to experimental data was found\nslightly better than with the commonly used objective function of maximal\ngrowth rate.\n  Based on our results, we suggest that the maximal growth efficiency can be\nconsidered as a plausible optimization criterion in metabolic modeling for E.\ncoli. In the future, it would be interesting to study growth efficiency as a\ncellular objective also in other cellular systems and under different\ncultivation conditions.\n",

Despite existence of\nmultiple mathematical models of translation, varying in the level of\nmechanistical details, surprisingly, there is no basic and simple chemical\nkinetic model of this process, derived directly from the detailed kinetic\nmodel. One of the reasons for this is that the translation process is\ncharacterized by indefinite number of states, thanks to existence of polysomes.\nWe bypass this difficulty by applying a trick consisting in lumping multiple\nstates of translated mRNA into few dynamical variables and by introducing a\nvariable describing the pool of translating ribosomes. The simplest model can\nbe solved analytically under some assumptions. The basic and simple model can\nbe extended, if necessary, to take into account various phenomena such as the\ninteraction between translating ribosomes, limited amount of ribosomal units or\nregulation of translation by microRNA. The model can be used as a building\nblock (translation module) for more complex models of cellular processes. We\ndemonstrate the utility of the model in two examples. First, we determine the\ncritical parameters of the single protein synthesis for the case when the\nribosomal units are abundant. Second, we demonstrate intrinsic bi-stability in\nthe dynamics of the ribosomal protein turnover and predict that a minimal\nnumber of ribosomes should pre-exists in a living cell to sustain its protein\nsynthesis machinery, even in the absence of proliferation.\n",

Although the\nidea of autocatalytic sets was already conceived of many years ago, only\nrecently have they gained more interest, following advances in creating them\nexperimentally in the laboratory. In our own work, we have studied\nautocatalytic sets extensively from a computational and theoretical point of\nview.\n  Results: We present results from an initial study of the dynamics of\nself-sustaining autocatalytic sets (RAFs). In particular, simulations of\nmolecular flow on autocatalytic sets are performed, to illustrate the kinds of\ndynamics that can occur.

While gene expression is often\nhighly erratic, embryonic development is usually exceedingly precise. In\nparticular, gene expression boundaries are robust not only against intrinsic\nnoise from gene expression and protein diffusion, but also against\nembryo-to-embryo variations in the morphogen gradients, which provide\npositional information to the differentiating cells. How development is robust\nagainst intra- and inter-embryonic variations is not understood. A common motif\nin the gene regulation networks that control embryonic development is mutual\nrepression between pairs of genes. To assess the role of mutual repression in\nthe robust formation of gene expression patterns, we have performed large-scale\nstochastic simulations of a minimal model of two mutually repressing gap genes\nin Drosophila, hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni). Our model includes not only\nmutual repression between hb and kni, but also the stochastic and cooperative\nactivation of hb by the anterior morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) and of kni by the\nposterior morphogen Caudal (Cad), as well as the diffusion of Hb and Kni. Our\nanalysis reveals that mutual repression can markedly increase the steepness and\nprecision of the gap gene expression boundaries. In contrast to spatial\naveraging and cooperative gene activation, mutual repression thus allows for\ngene-expression boundaries that are both steep and precise. Moreover, mutual\nrepression dramatically enhances their robustness against embryo-to-embryo\nvariations in the morphogen levels. Finally, our simulations reveal that gap\nprotein diffusion plays a critical role not only in reducing the width of gap\ngene expression boundaries via spatial averaging, but also in repairing\npatterning errors that could arise due to the bistability induced by mutual\nrepression.\n",

We introduce a\nkinetic network model that describes the functions of riboswitches at the\nsystems level. Using experimental data for flavin mono nucleotide riboswitch as\na guide we show that efficient function, implying a large dynamic range without\ncompromising the requirement to suppress transcription, is determined by a\nbalance between the transcription speed, the folding and unfolding rates of the\naptamer, and the binding rates of the metabolite. We also investigated the\neffect of negative feedback accounting for binding to metabolites, which are\nthemselves the products of genes that are being regulated. For a range of\ntranscription rates negative feedback suppresses gene expression by nearly 10\nfold. Negative feedback speeds the gene expression response time, and\nsuppresses the change of steady state protein concentration by half relative to\nthat without feedback, when there is a modest spike in DNA concentration. A\ndynamic phase diagram expressed in terms of transcription speed, folding rates,\nand metabolite binding rates predicts different scenarios in\nriboswitch-mediated transcription regulation.\n",

This study\nsystematically analyzes multiple-omics data and builds a systems physical\nnetwork including genome-wide interactions between miRNAs and their targets to\nreveal the systems mechanism of miRNA functions in mouse pluripotent stem\ncells. Globally, miRNAs directly repress the pluripotent core factors during\ndifferentiation state. Surprisingly, during pluripotent state, the top\nimportant miRNAs do not directly regulate the pluripotent core factors as\nthought, but they only directly target the pluripotent signal pathways and\ndirectly repress developmental processes. Furthermore, at pluripotent state\nmiRNAs predominately repress DNA methyltransferases, the core enzymes for DNA\nmethylation. The decreasing methylation repressed by miRNAs in turn activates\nthe top miRNAs and pluripotent core factors, creating an active circuit system\nto modulate pluripotency. MiRNAs vary their functions with different stem cell\nstates. While miRNAs directly repress pluripotent core factors to facilitate\nthe differentiation during cell differentiation, they also help stem cells to\nmaintain pluripotency by activating pluripotent cores through directly\nrepressing DNA methylation systems and primarily inhibiting development.\n",

Experimental results have shown that autocatalytic\nsets can indeed emerge in real chemical systems, and theoretical work has shown\nthat the existence of such self-sustaining sets is highly likely in formal\nmodels of chemical systems. Here, we take a first step towards merging these\ntwo lines of work by constructing and investigating a formal model of a real\nchemical system of RNA replicators exhibiting autocatalytic sets.\n  Results: We show that the formal model accurately reproduces recent\nexperimental results on an RNA replicator system, in particular how the system\ngoes through a sequence of larger and larger autocatalytic sets, and how a\ncooperative (autocatalytic) system can outcompete an equivalent selfish system.\nMoreover, the model provides additional insights that could not be obtained\nfrom experiments alone, and it suggests several experimentally testable\nhypotheses.\n  Conclusions: Given these additional insights and predictions, the modeling\nframework provides a better and more detailed understanding of the nature of\nchemical systems in general and the emergence of autocatalytic sets in\nparticular.

These\nnetworks have been formalised and investigated within the framework of RAF\ntheory, which has led to a number of insights and results concerning the\nlikelihood of such networks forming. In this paper, we extend this analysis by\nfocussing on how {\\em small} autocatalytic networks are likely to be when they\nfirst emerge. First we show that simulations are unlikely to settle this\nquestion, by establishing that the problem of finding a smallest RAF within a\ncatalytic reaction system is NP-hard. However, irreducible RAFs (irrRAFs) can\nbe constructed in polynomial time, and we show it is possible to determine in\npolynomial time whether a bounded size set of these irrRAFs contain the\nsmallest RAFs within a system. Moreover, we derive rigorous bounds on the sizes\nof small RAFs and use simulations to sample irrRAFs under the binary polymer\nmodel. We then apply mathematical arguments to prove a new result suggested by\nthose simulations: at the transition catalysis level at which RAFs first form\nin this model, small RAFs are unlikely to be present. We also investigate\nfurther the relationship between RAFs and another formal approach to\nself-sustaining and closed chemical networks, namely chemical organisation\ntheory (COT).\n",

To understand the role of individual\nmembers of this family within the MOMP regulation, we constructed a boolean\nnetwork-based mathematical model of interactions between the Bcl-2 proteins.\nResults of computational simulations reveal the existence of the potentially\nmalign configurations of activities of the Bcl-2 proteins, blocking the\noccurrence of MOMP, independently of the incoming stimuli. Our results suggest\nrole of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 in relation to these configurations. We\ndemonstrate here, the importance of the Bid and Bim according to activation of\neffectors Bax and Bak, and the irreversibility of this activation. The model\nfurther shows the distinct requirements for effectors activation, where the\nantiapoptic protein Bcl-w is seemingly a key factor preventing the Bax\nactivation.

In this article we show the complex system of\ninteractions determined by human Sirtuins (Sirt) largely involved in many\nmetabolic processes as well as in different diseases.

We exactly solve a stochastic model\ndescribing a ubiquitous motif in membrane signaling. The solution reveals that\npartitioning improves signaling reliability via two effects: it moderates the\nnon-linearity of the switching response, and it reduces noise in the response\nby suppressing correlations between molecules. An optimal partition size arises\nfrom a trade-off between minimizing the number of proteins per partition to\nimprove signaling reliability and ensuring sufficient proteins per partition to\nmaintain signal propagation. The predicted optimal partition size agrees\nquantitatively with experimentally observed systems. These results persist in\nspatial simulations with explicit diffusion barriers. Our findings suggest that\nmolecular partitioning is not merely a consequence of the complexity of\ncellular substructures, but also plays an important functional role in cell\nsignaling.\n",

The chemical master equation provides a fundamental\nframework for studying these networks, and the time-varying landscape\nprobability distribution over the full microstates provide a full\ncharacterization of the network dynamics. A complete characterization of the\nspace of the microstates is a prerequisite for obtaining the full landscape\nprobability distribution of a network. However, there are neither closed-form\nsolutions nor algorithms fully describing all microstates for a given molecular\nnetwork.\n  We have developed an algorithm that can exhaustively enumerate the\nmicrostates of a molecular network of small copy numbers under the finite\nbuffer condition that the net gain in newly synthesized molecules is smaller\nthan a predefined limit. We also describe a simple method for computing the\nexact mean or steady state landscape probability distribution over microstates.\nWe show how the full landscape probability for the gene networks of the\nself-regulating gene and the toggle-switch in the steady state can be fully\ncharacterized. We also give an example using the MAPK cascade network.\n  Our algorithm works for networks of small copy numbers buffered with a finite\ncopy number of net molecules that can be synthesized, regardless of the\nreaction stoichiometry, and is optimal in both storage and time complexity. The\nbuffer size is limited by the available memory or disk storage. Our algorithm\nis applicable to a class of biological networks when the copy numbers of\nmolecules are small and the network is closed, or the network is open but the\nnet gain in newly synthesized molecules does not exceed a predefined buffer\ncapacity.\n",

Although enhanced radial migration\nin plates suggested positive chemotaxis to both amino acids, capillary assays\nfailed to show an attractant response to either, in cells expressing only these\ntwo chemoreceptors. In vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)\nmeasurements of kinase activity revealed that in wild-type bacteria, cysteine\nand cystine are chemoeffectors of opposing sign, the reduced form being a\nchemoattractant and the oxidized form a repellent. The attractant response to\ncysteine was mediated primarily by Tsr, as reported earlier for E. coli. The\nrepellent response to cystine was mediated by McpB / C. Adaptive recovery upon\ncystine exposure required the methyl-transferase/-esterase pair, CheR / CheB,\nbut restoration of kinase activity was never complete (i.e. imperfect\nadaptation).

In this contribution networks describing the phosphorylation and\ndephosphorylation of a protein at $n$ sites in a sequential distributive\nmechanism are considered. Multistationarity (i.e.\\ the existence of at least\ntwo positive steady state solutions of the associated polynomial dynamical\nsystem) has been analyzed and established in several contributions. It is, for\nexample, known that there exist values for he rate constants where\nmultistationarity occurs. However, nothing else is known about these rate\nconstants.\n  Here we present a sign condition that is necessary and sufficient for\nmultistationarity in $n$-site sequential, distributive phosphorylation. We\nexpress this sign condition in terms of linear systems and show that solutions\nof these systems define rate constants where multistationarity is possible. We\nthen present, for $n\\geq 2$, a collection of {\\em feasible} linear systems and\nhence give a new and independent proof that multistationarity is possible for\n$n\\geq 2$. Moreover, our results allow to explicitly obtain values for the rate\nconstants where multistationarity is possible.

We show by modeling that in equilibrium systems the precision is\nlimited by the number of receptors; the downstream network can never increase\nprecision. This limit arises from a trade-off between the removal of extrinsic\nnoise in the receptor and intrinsic noise in the downstream network.\nNon-equilibrium systems can lift this trade-off by storing the receptor state\nover time in chemical modification states of downstream molecules.

A major advantage of these frameworks is that they do not require\nprecise quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large\nnetworks. While numerous groups have developed specific computational tools\nthat provide original methods to analyse qualitative models, a standard format\nto exchange qualitative models has been missing.\n  Results: We present the System Biology Markup Language (SBML) Qualitative\nModels Package (\"qual\"), an extension of the SBML Level 3 standard designed for\ncomputer representation of qualitative models of biological networks. We\ndemonstrate the interoperability of models via SBML qual through the analysis\nof a specific signalling network by three independent software tools.\nFurthermore, the cooperative development of the SBML qual format paved the way\nfor the development of LogicalModel, an open-source model library, which will\nfacilitate the adoption of the format as well as the collaborative development\nof algorithms to analyze qualitative models.\n  Conclusion: SBML qual allows the exchange of qualitative models among a\nnumber of complementary software tools. SBML qual has the potential to promote\ncollaborative work on the development of novel computational approaches, as\nwell as on the specification and the analysis of comprehensive qualitative\nmodels of regulatory and signalling networks.\n",

Here we show by\nmathematical modeling that living cells can multiplex a constant and an\noscillatory signal: they can transmit these two signals through the same\nsignaling pathway simultaneously, and yet respond to them specifically and\nreliably. We find that information transmission is reduced not only by noise\narising from the intrinsic stochasticity of biochemical reactions, but also by\ncrosstalk between the different channels. Yet, under biologically relevant\nconditions more than 2 bits of information can be transmitted per channel, even\nwhen the two signals are transmitted simultaneously.

        "summary": "  In many sensory systems, transmembrane receptors are spatially organized in\nlarge clusters. Such arrangement may facilitate signal amplification and the\nintegration of multiple stimuli. However, this organization likely also affects\nthe kinetics of signaling since the cytoplasmic enzymes that modulate the\nactivity of the receptors must localize to the cluster prior to receptor\nmodification. Here we examine how these spatial considerations shape signaling\ndynamics at rest and in response to stimuli. As a model, we use the chemotaxis\npathway of Escherichia coli, a canonical system for the study of how organisms\nsense, respond, and adapt to environmental stimuli. In bacterial chemotaxis,\nadaptation is mediated by two enzymes that localize to the clustered receptors\nand modulate their activity through methylation-demethylation. Using a novel\nstochastic simulation, we show that distributive receptor methylation is\nnecessary for successful adaptation to stimulus and also leads to large\nfluctuations in receptor activity in the steady state. These fluctuations arise\nfrom noise in the number of localized enzymes combined with saturated\nmodification kinetics between localized enzymes and receptor substrate. An\nanalytical model explains how saturated enzyme kinetics and large fluctuations\ncan coexist with an adapted state robust to variation in the expression level\nof the pathway constituents, a key requirement to ensure the functionality of\nindividual cells within a population. This contrasts with the well-mixed\ncovalent modification system studied by Goldbeter and Koshland in which mean\nactivity becomes ultrasensitive to protein abundances when the enzymes operate\nat saturation. Large fluctuations in receptor activity have been quantified\nexperimentally. Here we clarify their mechanistic relationship with\nwell-studied aspects of the chemotaxis system, precise adaptation and\nfunctional robustness.\n",

In contrast, essential plasticity, the dominant class,\ntends to be inter-pathway but strongly localized and unveils Cell Envelope\nBiosynthesis as an essential backup for Membrane Lipid Metabolism. When\ncomparing E. coli and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we find that the metabolic\nnetworks of the two organisms exhibit a large difference in the relative\nimportance of plasticity and redundancy which is consistent with the conjecture\nthat plasticity is a sophisticated mechanism that requires a complex\norganization. Finally, coessential reaction pairs are explored in different\nenvironmental conditions to uncover the interplay between the two mechanisms.\nWe find that synthetic lethal interactions and their classification in\nplasticity and redundancy are basically insensitive to medium composition, and\nare highly conserved even when the environment is enriched with nonessential\ncompounds or overconstrained to decrease maximum biomass formation.\n",

We address this fundamental problem in a class\nof model systems by developing a general mathematical framework that allows the\ncalculation of mesoscopic properties from the knowledge of microscopic\nMarkovian transition probabilities. We show how exact analytic formulae for the\nfirst and second moments of resident time distributions in mesostates can be\nderived from microscopic resident times and transition probabilities even for\nsystems with a large number of microstates. We apply our formalism to models of\nthe inositol trisphosphate receptor, which plays a key role in generating\ncalcium signals triggering a wide variety of cellular responses. We demonstrate\nhow experimentally accessible quantities, such as opening and closing times and\nthe coefficient of variation of inter-spike intervals, and other, more\nelaborated, quantities can be analytically calculated from the underlying\nmicroscopic Markovian dynamics. A virtue of our approach is that we do not need\nto follow the detailed time evolution of the whole system, as we derive the\nrelevant properties of its steady state without having to take into account the\noften extremely complicated transient features. We emphasize that our formulae\nfully agree with results obtained by stochastic simulations and approaches\nbased on a full determination of the microscopic system's time evolution. We\nalso illustrate how experiments can be devised to discriminate between\nalternative molecular models of the inositol trisphosphate receptor. The\ndeveloped approach is applicable to any system described by a Markov process\nand, owing to the analytic nature of the resulting formulae, provides an easy\nway to characterize also rare events that are of particular importance to\nunderstand the intermittency properties of complex dynamic systems.\n",

However, the initial\nconditions for these early stages are determined by the female during\noogenesis, and it is unknown whether reproducibility is passed on to the zygote\nor whether it is reacquired by the zygote. Here we examine the earliest\nreproducible pattern in the Drosophila embryo, the Bicoid protein gradient.\nUsing a unique combination of absolute molecule counting techniques, we show\nthat it is generated from a highly controlled source of mRNA molecules that is\nreproducible from embryo to embryo to within ~8%. This occurs in a perfectly\nlinear feed-forward process: changes in the female's gene dosage lead to\nproportional changes in the mRNA and protein counts in the embryo. In this\nsetup, noise is kept low in the transition from one molecular species to\nanother, allowing the female to precisely deposit the same absolute number of\nmRNA molecules in each embryo and therefore confer reproducibility to the\nBicoid pattern. Our results indicate that the reproducibility of the\nmorphological structures that emerge in the embryo originates during oogenesis\nwhen all initial patterning signals are controlled with precision similar to\nwhat we observe for the Bicoid pattern.\n",

One approach has been to measure the transcriptional output\n(fluorescently labeled messenger RNAs or proteins) from single cells in a\ngenetically identical population, which could then be compared to predictions\nfrom models that incorporate different molecular mechanisms of transcription\ninitiation. However, this approach suffers from the problem, that processes\ndownstream from transcription can affect the measured output and therefore mask\nthe signature of stochastic transcription initiation on the cell-to-cell\nvariability of the transcriptional outputs. Here we show theoretically that\nmeasurements of the cell-to-cell variability in the number of nascent RNAs\nprovide a more direct test of the mechanism of transcription initiation. We\nderive exact expressions for the first two moments of the distribution of\nnascent RNA molecules and apply our theory to published data for a collection\nof constitutively expressed yeast genes. We find that the measured nascent RNA\ndistributions are inconsistent with transcription initiation proceeding via one\nrate-limiting step, which has been generally inferred from measurements of\ncytoplasmic messenger RNA. Instead, we propose a two-step mechanism of\ninitiation, which is consistent with the available data. These findings for the\nyeast promoters highlight the utility of our theory for deciphering\ntranscriptional dynamics in vivo from experiments that count nascent RNA\nmolecules in single cells.\n",

This kind of phenotypic heterogeneity with\nstochastic phenotype switching is generally understood to be an adaptive\nbet-hedging strategy. Mathematical models are essential to gain a deeper\ninsight into the principle behind bet-hedging and the pattern behind\nexperimental data. Traditional deterministic models cannot provide a correct\ndescription of stochastic phenotype switching and bet-hedging, and traditional\nMarkov chain models at the cellular level fail to explain their underlying\nmolecular mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear stochastic model of\nmultistable bacterial systems at the molecular level. It turns out that our\nmodel not only provides a clear description of stochastic phenotype switching\nand bet-hedging within isogenic bacterial populations, but also provides a\ndeeper insight into the analysis of multidimensional experimental data.\nMoreover, we use some deep mathematical theories to show that our stochastic\nmodel and traditional Markov chain models are essentially consistent and\nreflect the dynamic behavior of the bacterial system at two different time\nscales. In addition, we provide a quantitative characterization of the critical\nstate of multistable bacterial systems and develop an effective data-driven\nmethod to identify the critical state without resorting to specific\nmathematical models.\n",

This study focuses on understanding\nthe influence of environmental conditions on bacterial denitrification\nperformance, using a mathematical model of a metabolic network in P.\naeruginosa. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of\ndenitrification for this bacterium. Analysis of the long-term behavior of the\nnetwork under changing concentration levels of oxygen ($O_{2}$), nitrate\n($NO_{3}$), and phosphate ($PO_{4}$) suggests that $PO_{4}$ concentration\nstrongly affects denitrification performance.

GRNs alone cannot explain the evolution of multicellular life in the\nCambrian Explosion. Networks are based on addressing systems which are used to\nconstruct network links. The more complex the network the greater the number of\nlinks and the larger the required address space. It has been assumed that\ncombinations of transcription factors generate a large enough address space to\nform GRNs that are complex enough to control the development of complex\nmulticellular life. However, it is shown in this article that transcription\nfactors do not have sufficient combinatorial power to serve as the basis of an\naddressing system for regulatory control of genomes in the development of\ncomplex organisms. It is proven that given $n$ transcription factor genes in a\ngenome and address combinations of length $k$ then there are at most $n/k$\nk-length transcription factor addresses in the address space. The complexity of\nembryonic development requires a corresponding complexity of control\ninformation in the cell and its genome. Therefore, a different addressing\nsystem must exist to form the complex control networks required for complex\ncontrol systems. It is postulated that a new type of network evolved based on\nan RNA-DNA addressing system that utilized and subsumed the extant GRNs. These\nnew developmental control networks are called CENES (for Control genes). The\nevolution of these new higher networks would explain how the Cambrian Explosion\nwas possible.

Stochastic switching between different phenotypes can occur as the\nresult of random fluctuations in molecular copy numbers of mRNA and proteins\narising in transcription, translation, transport, and binding. However, which\ncomponent of a pathway triggers such a transition is generally not known. By\nlinking single-cell experiments on the lactose-uptake pathway in E. coli to\nmolecular simulations, we devise a general method to pinpoint the particular\nfluctuation driving phenotype switching and apply this method to the transition\nbetween the uninduced and induced states of the lac genes.

We confirm this notion in\nstrains with a high expression level of the repressor (leading to shorter\nperiods over which the lac-operon remains unbound), which show a reduced\nswitching rate.

The standard models in enzyme kinetics generally ignore\nthe temporal dynamics of ATP because it is assumed to be present in large\nexcess. However, this assumption may not hold in many situations of cellular\nstress where ATP concentrations may be comparable to substrate levels. Here, we\ndemonstrate the importance of ATP concentration on the dynamics of multi-enzyme\nreactions by explicit consideration of ATP as a secondary substrate for an\nenzyme. We apply our model to the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase\ncascade, which is involved in the regulation of a vast range of cellular\nactivities. We show that three fundamental features of this signaling network\n--- (i) duration of response, (ii) signal amplification, and (iii)\nultrasensitivity to stimulus concentration --- are all dependent on ATP\nconcentration. Our results indicate that the concentration of ATP regulates the\nresponse of the MAP kinase activation network, and potentially suggests another\npossible mechanism for disruption of the cascade in pathogenic states.\n",

        "summary": "  Synthetic lethal reaction/gene-sets are sets of reactions/genes where only\nthe simultaneous removal of all reactions/genes in the set abolishes growth of\nan organism. In silico, synthetic lethal sets can be identified by simulating\nthe effect of removal of gene sets from the reconstructed genome-scale\nmetabolic network of an organism. Flux balance analysis (FBA), based on linear\nprogramming, has emerged as a powerful tool for the in silico analyses of\nmetabolic networks. To identify all possible synthetic lethal reactions\ncombinations, an exhaustive sampling of all possible combinations is\ncomputationally expensive. We surmount the computational complexity of\nexhaustive search by iteratively restricting the sample space of reaction\ncombinations for search, resulting in a substantial reduction in the running\ntime. We here propose an algorithm, Fast-SL, which provides an efficient way to\nanalyse metabolic networks for higher order lethal reaction sets. Fast-SL\noffers a substantial speed-up through a massive reduction in the search space\nfor synthetic lethals; in the case of E. coli, Fast-SL reduces the search space\nfor synthetic lethal triplets by over 4000-fold. Fast-SL also compares\nfavourably with SL Finder, an algorithm for identifying synthetic lethal sets,\nby Suthers et al (2009), which involves the solution of a bi-level Mixed\nInteger Linear Programming problem. We have implemented the Fast-SL algorithm\nin MATLAB, building upon COBRA toolbox v2.0.\n",

Several well-performing clustering algorithms exist to\ninfer topological network partitions. However, due to respective technical\nidiosyncrasies they might produce dissimilar modular decompositions of a given\nnetwork. In this contribution, we aimed to analyze how alternative modular\ndescriptions could condition the outcome of follow-up network biology analysis.\nWe considered a human protein interaction network and two paradigmatic cluster\nrecognition algorithms, namely: the Clauset-Newman-Moore and the infomap\nprocedures. We analyzed at what extent both methodologies yielded different\nresults in terms of granularity and biological congruency. In addition, taking\ninto account Guimera cartographic role characterization of network nodes, we\nexplored how the adoption of a given clustering methodology impinged on the\nability to highlight relevant network meso-scale connectivity patterns. As a\ncase study we considered a set of aging related proteins, and showed that only\nthe high-resolution modular description provided by infomap, could unveil\nstatistically significant associations between them and inter-intra modular\ncartographic features. Besides reporting novel biological insights that could\nbe gained from the discovered associations, our contribution warns against\npossible technical concerns that might affect the tools used to mine for\ninteraction patterns in network biology studies.

Recent studies in Naked Mole Rat (NMR) and long- lived sea\nurchin showed that the level of gene expression changes with age is lower than\nin other organisms. These phenotypic observations correlate well with\nexceptional endurance of NMR tissues to various genotoxic stresses. Therefore,\nthe lifelong transcriptional stability of an organism may be a key determinant\nof longevity. However, the exact relation between genetic network stability,\nstress-resistance and aging has not been defined. We analyze the stability of a\nsimple genetic- network model of a living organism under the influence of\nexternal and endogenous factors. We demonstrate that under most common\ncircumstances a gene network is inherently unstable and suffers from\nexponential accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.\nHowever, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective, the gene network\ncan stabilize so that gene damage remains constrained along with mortality of\nthe organism, which may then enjoy a remarkable degree of stability over very\nlong times. We clarify the relation between stress-resistance and aging and\nsuggest that stabilization of the genetic network may provide a mathematical\nexplanation of the Gompertz equation describing the relationship between age\nand mortality in many species, and of the apparently negligible senescence\nobserved in exceptionally long-lived animals.

However, diseases such as cancer are a\nresult of the combined effect of multiple genes. Gene products such as proteins\nseldom act in isolation, but instead constitute stable multi-protein complexes\nperforming dedicated functions. Therefore, complexes aggregate the effect of\nindividual genes (proteins) and can be used to gain a better understanding of\ncancer mechanisms. Here, we observe that complexes show considerable changes in\ntheir expression, in turn directed by the concerted action of transcription\nfactors (TFs), across cancer conditions. We seek to gain novel insights into\ncancer mechanisms through a systematic analysis of complexes and their\ntranscriptional regulation.\n  Results: We integrated large-scale protein-interaction (PPI) and\ngene-expression datasets to identify complexes that exhibit significant changes\nin their expression across different conditions in cancer. We devised a\nlog-linear model to relate these changes to the differential regulation of\ncomplexes by TFs. The application of our model on two case studies involving\npancreatic and familial breast tumour conditions revealed: (i) complexes in\ncore cellular processes, especially those responsible for maintaining genome\nstability and cell proliferation (e.g. DNA damage repair and cell cycle) show\nconsiderable changes in expression; (ii) these changes include decrease and\ncountering increase for different sets of complexes indicative of compensatory\nmechanisms coming into play in tumours; and (iii) TFs work in cooperative and\ncounteractive ways to regulate these mechanisms.

We note that stochastic fluctuations can possibly confer a new\ndynamical capability to a network. Thus, it is of tremendous value to\nunderstand and be able to control the landscape of stochastic dynamical\nbehaviors of a biochemical reaction network as a function of network\narchitecture. Here we investigate such a case where stochastic fluctuations can\ngive rise to the new capability of noise-induced oscillation in a subset of\nbiochemical reaction networks, the networks with only three biochemical species\nwhose reactions are governed by mass action kinetics and with the coupling of\npositive and negative feedback loops. We model the networks with the master\nequations and approximate them, using the linear noise approximation. For each\nnetwork, we read the signal-to-noise ratio value, an indicator of amplified and\ncoherent noise-induced oscillation, off from the analytically derived power\nspectra. We classify the networks into three performance groups based on the\naverage values of the signal-to-noise ratio and the robustness. We identify the\ncommon network architecture among the networks belonging to the same\nperformance group, from which we learn that the coupling of negative and\npositive feedback loops generally enhance the noise-induced oscillation\nperformance better than the negative feedback loops alone. The performance of\nnetworks also depends on the relative size of the positive and negative\nfeedback loops; the networks with the bigger positive and smaller negative\nfeedbacks are much worse oscillators than the networks with only negative\nfeedback loops.\n",

Previous work has shown that single, dissociated SCN neurons\nrespond differently to Cry1 and Cry2 knockouts: Cry1 knockouts are arrhythmic\nwhile Cry2 knockouts display more regular rhythms. These differences have led\nto speculation that CRY1 and CRY2 may play different functional roles in the\noscillator.

The fundamental\nmathematical abstraction of a network as a weighted graph brings to bear the\ntools of graph theory--a highly developed subject of mathematical research. But\nmore importantly, recently proposed geometric notions of curvature on very\ngeneral metric measure spaces allow us to utilize a whole new set of tools and\nideas that help quantify functionality and robustness of graphs. In particular,\nrobustness is closely connected to network entropy which, in turn, is very\nclosely related to curvature. We will see that there are a number of\nalternative notions of discrete curvature that are compatible with the\nclassical Riemannian definition, each having its own advantages and\ndisadvantages, and are relevant to networks of interest.

Using a flux-based\ndescription of kinetic models, a canonical representation of the set of all\npossible feasible equilibria is developed. The characterization is made in\nterms of strictly stable compartmental matrices to define the so-called family\nof solutions. Feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints, which are linear\non a log-transformed space of complexes, and relate to the kernel of a matrix,\nthe columns of which span the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly\ninteresting representation of these constraints can be expressed in terms of a\nclass of monotonous decreasing functions. This allows connections to be\nestablished with classical results in CRNT that relate to the existence and\nuniqueness of equilibria along positive stoichiometric compatibility classes.\nIn particular, monotonicity can be employed to identify regions in the set of\npossible reaction rate coefficients leading to complex balancing, and to\nconclude uniqueness of equilibria for a class of positive deficiency networks.\nThe latter result might support constructing an alternative proof of the\nwell-known deficiency one theorem.

Our\nresults reveal that p53 activities can display rich dynamics under different\nPDCD5 levels, including monostability, bistability with two stable steady\nstates, oscillations, and co-existence of a stable steady state and an\noscillatory state. Physical properties of the p53 oscillations are further\nshown by the potential landscape, in which the potential force attracts the\nsystem state to the limit cycle attractor, and the curl flux force drives the\ncoherent oscillation along the cyclic. We also investigate the effect of PDCD5\nefficiency on inducing the p53 oscillations. We show that Hopf bifurcation is\ninduced by increasing the PDCD5 efficiency, and the system dynamics show clear\ntransition features in both barrier height and energy dissipation when the\nefficiency is close to the bifurcation point.

The cross-over from one steady state (weakly regulated) to the other\n(strongly regulated) is accompanied by a divergence-like growth in the\nfluctuation of both the effector and regulatory T-cell concentration over a\nwide range of pathogenic stimulation, displaying a dynamical phase transition\nlike behavior. The growth in fluctuation in this desired immune response regime\nis found to arise from an intermittent fluctuation between regulatory and\neffector T-cells that results in a bimodal distribution of population of each,\nindicating bistability. The signature of intermittent behavior is further\nconfirmed by calculating the power spectrum of the corresponding fluctuation of\ntime correlation function. The calculated time correlation functions of\nfluctuations show that the slow fluctuation causes the bistabilty in healthy\nstate. Thus, in diseases diagnosis process, such steady state response\nparameters can provide immense information which might become helpful to define\nan immune status.\n",

Recent work on the optimization of information flow\nthrough regulatory networks indicates that the lower end of the dynamic range\nof concentrations is simply inaccessible, overwhelmed by the impact of this\nnoise. Motivated by the behavior of homeodomain proteins, such as the maternal\nmorphogen Bicoid in the fruit fly embryo, we suggest a scheme in which\ntranscription factors also act as indirect translational regulators, binding to\nthe mRNA of other transcription factors.

With a Markovian representation and a simple\nmodel of repression, we prove that, under a scaling regime, the repression\nmechanism follows a Hill repression scheme with an hyperbolic control. An\nexplicit asymptotic expression of the variance of the number of proteins under\nthis regulation mechanism is obtained. Simulations are used to study other\naspects of autoregulation such as the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the\nproduction process and the case where the control of the production process of\nproteins is achieved via the inhibition of mRNAs.\n",

Since\nproteins half-lives can be comparable to the cell-cycle length, randomness in\ncell-division times generates additional intercellular variability in protein\nlevels. Moreover, as many mRNA/protein species are expressed at low-copy\nnumbers, errors incurred in partitioning of molecules between the mother and\ndaughter cells are significant. We derive analytical formulas for the total\nnoise in protein levels for a general class of cell-division time and\npartitioning error distributions. Using a novel hybrid approach the total noise\nis decomposed into components arising from i) stochastic expression; ii)\npartitioning errors at the time of cell-division and iii) random cell-division\nevents. These formulas reveal that random cell-division times not only generate\nadditional extrinsic noise but also critically affect the mean protein copy\nnumbers and intrinsic noise components. Counter intuitively, in some parameter\nregimes noise in protein levels can decrease as cell-division times become more\nstochastic. Computations are extended to consider genome duplication, where the\ngene dosage is increased by two-fold at a random point in the cell-cycle. We\nsystematically investigate how the timing of genome duplication influences\ndifferent protein noise components. Intriguingly, results show that noise\ncontribution from stochastic expression is minimized at an optimal genome\nduplication time. Our theoretical results motivate new experimental methods for\ndecomposing protein noise levels from single-cell expression data.\nCharacterizing the contributions of individual noise mechanisms will lead to\nprecise estimates of gene expression parameters and techniques for altering\nstochasticity to change phenotype of individual cells.\n",

Not surprisingly, cells encode diverse\nregulatory mechanisms to buffer noise. One such mechanism is the incoherent\nfeedforward circuit. We analyze a simplistic version of this circuit, where an\nupstream regulator X affects both the production and degradation of a protein\nY. Thus, any random increase in X's copy numbers would increase both production\nand degradation, keeping Y levels unchanged. To study its stochastic dynamics,\nwe formulate this network into a mathematical model using the Chemical Master\nEquation formulation. We prove that if the functional dependence of Y's\nproduction and degradation on X is similar, then the steady-distribution of Y's\ncopy numbers is independent of X. To investigate how fluctuations in Y\npropagate downstream, a protein Z whose production rate only depend on Y is\nintroduced. Intriguingly, results show that the extent of noise in Z increases\nwith noise in X, in spite of the fact that the magnitude of noise in Y is\ninvariant of X. Such counter intuitive results arise because X enhances the\ntime-scale of fluctuations in Y, which amplifies fluctuations in downstream\nprocesses. In summary, while feedforward systems can buffer a protein from\nnoise in its upstream regulators, noise can propagate downstream due to changes\nin the time-scale of fluctuations.\n",

In recent years, SL has\nemerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the\nSL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be selectively\nkilled while sparing the normal cells. Consequently, a number of studies have\nattempted prediction of SL interactions in human, a majority by extrapolating\nSL interactions inferred through large-scale screens in model organisms.\nHowever, these predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or\ndo not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers, and are\ntherefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy.\n  Results: Here, we develop a computational approach to infer SL interactions\ndirectly from frequently altered genes in human cancers. It is based on the\nobservation that pairs of genes that are altered in a (significantly) mutually\nexclusive manner in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using\ngenomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers, breast,\nprostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas, we identify 718 genes that are frequently amplified or upregulated, and\nare likely to be synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes\nin these cancers. By comparing with published data on gene essentiality (~16000\ngenes) from ten DDR-deficient cancer cell lines, we show that our identified\ngenes are enriched among the top quartile of essential genes in these cell\nlines, implying that our inferred genes are highly likely to be (synthetic)\nlethal upon knockdown in these cell lines.\n",

We argue that the cyanobacterium Synechococcus\nelongatus has evolved two features that protect its clock from such\ndisturbances, both of which are needed to fully insulate it from the cell cycle\nand give it its observed robustness: a phosphorylation-based protein\nmodification oscillator, together with its accompanying push-pull read-out\ncircuit that responds primarily to the ratios of the different phosphoforms,\nmakes the clock less susceptible to perturbations in protein synthesis; and the\npresence of multiple, asynchronously replicating copies of the same chromosome\ndiminishes the effect of replicating any single copy of a gene.\n",

Although the key molecular players involved\nin the metabolic and regulatory processes underlying this system have been\nknown for decades, their interactions and chemical kinetics remain incompletely\nunderstood. Mathematical models can provide an alternative method to study the\ndynamics of this network from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective.\nHere, we employ such approaches to unravel the main properties of the galactose\nnetwork, including equilibrium binary and temporal responses, as a way to\ndecipher its adaptation to actively-changing inputs. We combine the two main\ncomponents of the network; namely, the genetic branch which allows for bistable\nresponses, and a metabolic branch, encompassing the relevant metabolic\nprocesses and glucose repressive reactions. We use both computational tools to\nestimate model parameters based on published experimental data, as well as\nbifurcation analysis to decipher the properties of the system in various\nparameter regimes. Our model analysis reveals that the interplay between the\ninducer (galactose) and the repressor (glucose) creates the bistability regime\nwhich dictates the temporal responses of the system.

A periodically changing allocation of the\nprotein budget between reactions or pathways may increase the overall metabolic\nefficiency. To study this hypothesis, I quantify the possible benefits of\nsmall-amplitude enzyme rhythms in kinetic models. Starting from an\nenzyme-optimised steady state, I score the effects of possible enzyme rhythms\non a metabolic objective and optimise their amplitudes and phase shifts.\nAssuming small-amplitude rhythms around an optimal reference state, optimal\nphases and amplitudes can be computed by solving a quadratic optimality\nproblem. In models without amplitude constraints, general periodic enzyme\nprofiles can be obtained by Fourier synthesis. The theory of optimal enzyme\nrhythms combines the dynamics and economics of metabolic systems and explains\nhow optimal small-amplitude enzyme profiles are shaped by network structure,\nkinetics, external rhythms, and the metabolic objective. The formulae show how\norchestrated enzyme rhythms can exploit synergy effects to improve metabolic\nperformance and that optimal enzyme profiles are not simply adapted to existing\nmetabolic rhythms, but that they actively shape these rhythms to improve their\nown (and other enzymes') efficiency. The resulting optimal enzyme profiles\n\"portray\" the enzymes' dynamic effects in the network: for example, enzymes\nthat act synergistically may be coexpressed, periodically and with some optimal\nphase shifts. The theory yields optimality conditions for enzyme rhythms in\nmetabolic cycles, with static enzyme adaptation as a special case, and predicts\nhow cells should combine transcriptional and posttranslational regulation to\nrealise enzyme rhythms at different frequencies.\n",

The patterning system is thus said to encode\npositional information, a concept that was formalized recently in the framework\nof information theory. Here we introduce a toy model of patterning in one\nspatial dimension, which can be seen as an extension of Wolpert's paradigmatic\n\"French Flag\" model, to patterning by several interacting, spatially coupled\ngenes subject to intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Our model, a variant of an\nIsing spin system, allows us to systematically explore expression patterns that\noptimally encode positional information. We find that optimal patterning\nsystems use positional cues, as in the French Flag model, together with\ngene-gene interactions to generate combinatorial codes for position which we\ncall \"Counter\" patterns. Counter patterns can also be stabilized against noise\nand variations in system size or morphogen dosage by longer-range spatial\ninteractions of the type invoked in the Turing model.

Moreover, similar amounts of\ndifferent enzymes might incur different costs for the cell, depending on\nenzyme-specific properties such as protein size and half-life. Here, we\ndeveloped enzyme cost minimization (ECM), a scalable method for computing\nenzyme amounts that support a given metabolic flux at a minimal protein cost.\nThe complex interplay of enzyme and metabolite concentrations, e.g. through\nthermodynamic driving forces and enzyme saturation, would make it hard to solve\nthis optimization problem directly. By treating enzyme cost as a function of\nmetabolite levels, we formulated ECM as a numerically tractable, convex\noptimization problem.

We are interested in networks\nthat contain n high-degree nodes preferably connected to a large number of Ns\nweakly connected satellites, a property that we call n/Ns-centrality. If the\nhub dynamics is slow, we obtain that the large time network dynamics is\ncompletely defined by the hub dynamics. Moreover, such networks are maximally\nflexible and switchable, in the sense that they can switch from a globally\nattractive rest state to any structurally stable dynamics when the response\ntime of a special controller hub is changed. In particular, we show that a\ndecrease of the controller hub response time can lead to a sharp variation in\nthe network attractor structure: we can obtain a set of new local attractors,\nwhose number can increase exponentially with N, the total number of nodes of\nthe nework. These new attractors can be periodic or even chaotic. We provide an\nalgorithm, which allows us to design networks with the desired switching\nproperties, or to learn them from time series, by adjusting the interactions\nbetween hubs and satellites. Such switchable networks could be used as models\nfor context dependent adaptation in functional genetics or as models for\ncognitive functions in neuroscience.\n",

We investigated a biophysical\nmodel of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription\nfactor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by\nbinding energy (-{\\Delta}G) and TF dosage. Transcription and gene expression\nproceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids, individuals may be\nheterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or at the TF's own\npromoter, which determines allele-specific dosage. We find that when the TF's\ncoding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for occupancy at the cis\nsites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion to the difference in\nbinding strength. When the TF's own promoter is heterozygous, the TF produced\nat the higher dosage is also dominant. Cis-site heterozygotes have additive\nexpression and therefore codominant phenotypes. Binding dominance propagates to\naffect the expression of downstream loci and it is sensitive in both magnitude\nand direction to genetic background, but its detectability often attenuates.\nWhile binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular level, it is difficult\nto detect in the phenotype under some biophysical conditions, more so when TF\ndosage is high and allele-specific binding affinities are similar. A body of\nempirical research on the biophysics of TF binding demonstrates the\nplausibility of this mechanism of dominance, but studies of gene expression\nunder competitive binding in heterozygotes in a diversity of genetic\nbackgrounds are needed.\n",

The\ninitial measurement of the morphogens by the hunchback promoter takes place\nduring very short cell cycles, not only giving each nucleus little time for a\nprecise readout, but also resulting in short time traces of transcription.\nAdditionally, the relationship between the measured signal and the promoter\nstate depends on the molecular design of the reporting probe.

Many of these\nprocesses are based on gene expression. For example, an activated gene may be\nrequired to reach in a precise time a threshold level of expression that\ntriggers a specific downstream process. However, gene expression is subject to\nstochastic fluctuations, naturally inducing an uncertainty in this\nthreshold-crossing time with potential consequences on biological functions and\nphenotypes. Here, we consider such \"timing fluctuations\", and we ask how they\ncan be controlled. Our analytical estimates and simulations show that, for an\ninduced gene, timing variability is minimal if the threshold level of\nexpression is approximately half of the steady-state level. Timing fuctuations\ncan be reduced by increasing the transcription rate, while they are insensitive\nto the translation rate. In presence of self-regulatory strategies, we show\nthat self-repression reduces timing noise for threshold levels that have to be\nreached quickly, while selfactivation is optimal at long times. These results\nlay a framework for understanding stochasticity of endogenous systems such as\nthe cell cycle, as well as for the design of synthetic trigger circuits.\n",

The stochasticity stems from the updating schedule. Standard updating\nschedules include the synchronous update, where all the nodes are updated at\nthe same time, and the asynchronous update where a random node is updated at\neach time step. The former produces a deterministic dynamics while the latter a\nstochastic dynamics. A more general stochastic setting considers propensity\nparameters for updating each node. Stochastic Discrete Dynamical Systems (SDDS)\nis a modeling framework that considers two propensity parameters for updating\neach node and uses one when the update has a positive impact on the variable,\nthat is, when the update causes the variable to increase its value, and uses\nthe other when the update has a negative impact, that is, when the update\ncauses it to decrease its value. This framework offers additional features for\nsimulations but also adds a complexity in parameter estimation of the\npropensities. This paper presents a method for estimating the propensity\nparameters for SDDS. The method is based on adding noise to the system using\nthe Google PageRank approach to make the system ergodic and thus guaranteeing\nthe existence of a stationary distribution.

        "summary": "  Recently, there has been a lot of effort in understanding sRNA mediated\nregulation of gene expression and how this mode of regulation differs from\ntranscriptional regulation.In E.coli, in the presence of oxidative stress, the\nsynthesis of sigma^s is regulated through an interesting mechanism involving\nboth transcriptional and sRNA-mediated translational regulation. The key\nregulatory factors involved in transcriptional and translational regulation are\nArcA and ArcB proteins and ArcZ sRNA, respectively. Phosphorylated ArcA, in a\nfeedforward mechanism, represses the transcriptions sigma^s and ArcZ sRNA with\nthe latter being a post-transcriptional activator for sigma^s. Through a\nfeedback mechanisms, ArcZ sRNA destabilises ArcB mRNA and regulates the level\nof ArcB protein, a kinase that phosphorylates ArcA. The oxygen and energy\navailability is expected to influence the ArcA phosphorylation rate and, as a\nconsequence, in equilibrium, the system is likely to be in either a high ArcB\n(low ArcZ) or a low ArcB (high ArcZ) state. Kinetic modelling studies suggest\nthat the rate of destabilisation of ArcB mRNA by ArcZ sRNA must be\nappropriately tuned for achieving the desired state. In particular, for a high\nphosphorylation rate, the transition from a low to a high ArcZ synthesis regime\nwith the increase in sRNA-mRNA interaction is similar to the threshold-linear\nresponse observed earlier. Further, we show that the mRNA destabilisation by\nsRNA might be, in particular, beneficial in the low phosphorylation state for\nhaving the right concentration levels of ArcZ and ArcB. Stochastic simulation\nresults suggest that as the ArcZ-ArcB binding affinity is increased, the\nprobability distribution for the number of ArcZ molecules becomes flatter\nindicating frequently occurring transcriptional bursts of varying strengths.\n",

However, the biology of QS\nremains incompletely understood in heterogeneous communities, where variant\nbacterial strains possess distinct QS systems that produce chemically unique\nAIs. AI molecules bind to 'cognate' receptors, but also to 'non-cognate'\nreceptors found in other strains, resulting in inter-strain crosstalk.\nUnderstanding these interactions is a prerequisite for deciphering the\nconsequences of crosstalk in real ecosystems, where multiple AIs are regularly\npresent in the same environment. As a step towards this goal, we map crosstalk\nin a heterogeneous community of variant QS strains onto an artificial neural\nnetwork model. This formulation allows us to systematically analyze how\ncrosstalk regulates the community's capacity for flexible decision making, as\nquantified by the Boltzmann entropy of all QS gene expression states of the\nsystem. In a mean-field limit of complete cross-inhibition between variant\nstrains, the model is exactly solvable, allowing for an analytical formula for\nthe number of variants that maximize capacity as a function of signal kinetics\nand activation parameters. An analysis of previous experimental results on the\nStaphylococcus aureus two-component Agr system indicates that the observed\ncombination of variant numbers, gene expression rates and threshold\nconcentrations lies near this critical regime of parameter space where capacity\npeaks.

Methods exist to measure the GO\nsimilarity between two proteins in isolation, but pairs of proteins in a\nnetwork alignment are not isolated: each pairing is implicitly dependent upon\nevery other pairing via the alignment itself. Current methods fail to take into\naccount the frequency of GO terms across the networks, and attempt to account\nfor common GO terms in an ad hoc fashion by imposing arbitrary rules on when to\n\"allow\" GO terms based on their location in the GO hierarchy, rather than using\nreadily available frequency information in the PPI networks themselves. Here we\ndevelop a new measure, NetGO, that naturally weighs infrequent, informative GO\nterms more heavily than frequent, less informative GO terms, without requiring\narbitrary cutoffs. In particular, NetGO down-weights the score of frequent GO\nterms according to their frequency in the networks being aligned. This is a\nglobal measure applicable only to alignments, independent of pairwise GO\nmeasures, in the same sense that the edge-based EC or S3 scores are global\nmeasures of topological similarity independent of pairwise topological\nsimilarities. We demonstrate the superiority of NetGO by creating alignments of\npredetermined quality based on homologous pairs of nodes and show that NetGO\ncorrelates with alignment quality much better than any existing GO-based\nalignment measures. We also demonstrate that NetGO provides a measure of\ntaxonomic similarity between species, consistent with existing taxonomic\nmeasures--a feature not shared with existing GO-based network alignment\nmeasures.

In particular, mRNA synthesis is\nnow acknowledged to occur in a highly bursty manner. We propose to view the\ninference problem as a fitting procedure for a mechanistic gene network model\nthat is inherently stochastic and takes not only protein, but also mRNA levels\ninto account. We first explain how to build and simulate this network model\nbased upon the coupling of genes that are described as piecewise-deterministic\nMarkov processes. Our model is modular and can be used to implement various\nbiochemical hypotheses including causal interactions between genes. However, a\nnaive fitting procedure would be intractable. By performing a relevant\napproximation of the stationary distribution, we derive a tractable procedure\nthat corresponds to a statistical hidden Markov model with interpretable\nparameters. This approximation turns out to be extremely close to the\ntheoretical distribution in the case of a simple toggle-switch, and we show\nthat it can indeed fit real single-cell data. As a first step toward inference,\nour approach was applied to a number of simple two-gene networks simulated in\nsilico from the mechanistic model and satisfactorily recovered the original\nnetworks.

Whereas early attempts at network\nreverse-engineering focused predominantly on producing maps of system\narchitectures with minimal predictive modeling, reconstructions now play\ninstrumental roles in answering questions about the statistics and dynamics of\nthe underlying systems they represent. Many of these predictions have clinical\nrelevance, suggesting novel paradigms for drug discovery and disease treatment.\nWhile other reviews focus predominantly on the details and effectiveness of\nindividual network inference algorithms, here we examine the emerging field as\na whole. We first summarize several key application areas in which inferred\nnetworks have made successful predictions. We then outline the two major\nclasses of reverse-engineering methodologies, emphasizing that the type of\nprediction that one aims to make dictates the algorithms one should employ. We\nconclude by discussing whether recent breakthroughs justify the computational\ncosts of large-scale reverse-engineering sufficiently to admit it as a mainstay\nin the quantitative analysis of living systems.\n",

With the advancement of strand-displacement DNA computing, a large\nclass of abstract biochemical networks may be physically realized using DNA\nmolecules. Methods for systematic design of the abstract systems with\nprescribed behaviors have been predominantly developed at the (less-detailed)\ndeterministic level. However, stochastic effects, neglected at the\ndeterministic level, are increasingly found to play an important role in\nbiochemistry. In such circumstances, methods for controlling the intrinsic\nnoise in the system are necessary for a successful network design at the\n(more-detailed) stochastic level. To bridge the gap, the noise-control\nalgorithm for designing biochemical networks is developed in this paper. The\nalgorithm structurally modifies any given reaction network under mass-action\nkinetics, in such a way that (i) controllable state-dependent noise is\nintroduced into the stochastic dynamics, while (ii) the deterministic dynamics\nare preserved. The capabilities of the algorithm are demonstrated on a\nproduction-decay reaction system, and on an exotic system displaying\nbistability. For the production-decay system, it is shown that the algorithm\nmay be used to redesign the network to achieve noise-induced multistability.\nFor the exotic system, the algorithm is used to redesign the network to control\nthe stochastic switching, and achieve noise-induced oscillations.\n",

Different formalisms and a huge\nvariety of classical mathematical tools have been used to describe and analyse\nsuch networks. Michael A. Savageau defined a formalism to model\ngenetic-metabolic networks called S-Systems, [12], [13], [15]. There is a limit\nin the number of nodes that can be analysed when these systems are solved using\nclassical numerical methods such as non-linear dynamic analysis and linear\noptimization algorithms. We propose to use toric algebraic geometry to solve\nS-systems. In this work we prove that S-systems are toric varieties and that as\na consequence Hilbert basis can be used to solve them. This is achieved by\napplying two theorems, proved here, the theorem about Embedding of S-Systems in\ntoric varieties and the theorem about Toric Resolution on S-Systems. In\naddition, we define the realization of minimal phenotypic polytopes, phenotypic\ntoric ideals and phenotypic toric varieties as a generalization of the\nphenotypic polytopes described by M. Savageau, [8], [9], [10]. Also we studied\na synthetic oscillatory network of two genes under diverse environmental\ncontrol modes, we reproduce S.

Mathematical tools based on\ndynamical systems theory are often used to model these networks, but the size\nand complexity of these models mean that their behaviour is not always\nintuitive and the underlying mechanisms can be difficult to decipher. For this\nreason, methods that simplify and aid exploration of complex networks are\nnecessary. To this end we develop a broadly applicable form of the Zwanzig-Mori\nprojection. By first converting a thermodynamic state ensemble model of gene\nregulation into mass action reactions we derive a general method that produces\na set of time evolution equations for a subset of components of a network. The\ninfluence of the rest of the network, the bulk, is captured by memory functions\nthat describe how the subnetwork reacts to its own past state via components in\nthe bulk. These memory functions provide probes of near-steady state dynamics,\nrevealing information not easily accessible otherwise. We illustrate the method\non a simple cross-repressive transcriptional motif to show that memory\nfunctions not only simplify the analysis of the subnetwork but also have a\nnatural interpretation. We then apply the approach to a GRN from the vertebrate\nneural tube, a well characterised developmental transcriptional network\ncomposed of four interacting transcription factors. The memory functions reveal\nthe function of specific links within the neural tube network and identify\nfeatures of the regulatory structure that specifically increase the robustness\nof the network to initial conditions.

PNA produces aligned node pairs between two networks.\nMNA produces aligned node clusters between more than two networks.

The issue is that, due\nto the different outputs of PNA and MNA, a PNA method is only compared to other\nPNA methods, and an MNA method is only compared to other MNA methods.\nComparison of PNA against MNA must be done to evaluate whether MNA's higher\ncomplexity is justified by its higher accuracy.

Thermodynamically infeasible cy-cles (TICs) causing unbounded\nmetabolic flux ranges are often encountered. TICs satisfy the mass balance and\ndirectionality constraints but violate the second law of thermodynamics.\nCurrent prac-tices involve implementing additional constraints to ensure not\nonly optimal but also loopless flux distributions. However, the mixed integer\nlinear programming problems required to solve become computationally\nintractable for genome-scale metabolic models. Results: We aimed to identify\nthe fewest needed constraints sufficient for optimality under the loop-less\nrequirement. We found that loopless constraints are required only for the\nreactions that share elementary flux modes representing TICs with reactions\nthat are part of the objective function. We put forth the concept of localized\nloopless constraints (LLCs) to enforce this minimal required set of loopless\nconstraints. By combining with a novel procedure for minimal null-space\ncalculation, the computational time for loopless flux variability analysis is\nreduced by a factor of 10-150 compared to the original loopless constraints and\nby 4-20 times compared to the currently fastest method Fast-SNP with the\npercent improvement increasing with model size.

While the exact relationship of each of the three definitions of\ncurvature to one another is still not known, they do yield similar results on\nour biological networks of interest. These notions are initially defined on\npositively weighted graphs; however, Forman-Ricci curvature can also be defined\non directed positively weighted networks. We will generalize this notion of\ndirected Forman Ricci curvature on the network to a form that also considers\nthe signs of the directions (e. g., activator and repressor in transcription\nnetworks). We call this notion the \\emph{signed-control Ricci curvature}. Given\nreal biological networks are almost always directed and possess positive and\nnegative controls, the notion of signed-control curvature can elucidate the\nnetwork-based study of these complex networks. Finally, we compare the results\nof these notions of Ricci curvature on networks to some known network measures,\nnamely, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficients on graphs.\n",

For a biomolecular oscillator, the\noverall constraints in how tuning of amplitude affects period, and vice versa,\nare generally unclear. Here we investigate this co-variation of the period and\namplitude in mathematical models of biomolecular oscillators using both\nsimulations and analytical approximations. We computed the amplitude-period\nco-variation of eleven benchmark biomolecular oscillators as their parameters\nwere individually varied around a nominal value, classifying the various\nco-variation patterns such as a simultaneous increase/ decrease in period and\namplitude. Next, we repeated the classification using a power norm-based\namplitude metric, to account for the amplitudes of the many biomolecular\nspecies that may be part of the oscillations, finding largely similar trends.\nFinally, we calculate \"scaling laws\" of period-amplitude co-variation for a\nsubset of these benchmark oscillators finding that as the approximated period\nincreases, the upper bound of the amplitude increases, or reaches a constant\nvalue. Based on these results, we discuss the effect of different parameters on\nthe type of period-amplitude co-variation as well as the difficulty in\nachieving an oscillation with large amplitude and small period.\n",

Stochastic simulation is often inefficient for such\nsystems, because most of the simulation time is spent waiting for rare,\nbarrier-crossing events to occur. We present a rare-event simulation-based\nmethod for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in\nmetastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of\nmetastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an\nautomated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic\ninformation that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied\nto a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations\nrevealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among\nphenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative\nprobabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and\ndifferentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing\ntranscription factor-DNA binding kinetics.

The first section provides a brief history of\nempirical observations on toxicity dating back to the dawn of Sumerian\ncivilization. Interestingly, the concept of dose emerged very early on, leading\nup to the modern emphasis on kinetic properties, which in turn encodes the\ninsight that toxicity is not solely a property of a compound but instead\ndepends on the interaction with the host organism. The next logical step is the\ncurrent conception of evaluating drugs from a personalized medicine\npoint-of-view. We review recent work on integrating what could be referred to\nas classical pharmacokinetic analysis with emerging systems biology approaches\nincorporating multiple omics data. These systems approaches employ advanced\nstatistical analytical data processing complemented with machine learning\ntechniques and use both pharmacokinetic and omics data. We find that such\nintegrated approaches not only provide improved predictions of toxicity but\nalso enable mechanistic interpretations of the molecular mechanisms\nunderpinning toxicity and drug resistance. We conclude the chapter by\ndiscussing some of the main challenges, such as how to balance the inherent\ntension between the predictive capacity of models, which in practice amounts to\nconstraining the number of features in the models versus allowing for rich\nmechanistic interpretability, i.e. equipping models with numerous molecular\nfeatures. This challenge also requires patient-specific predictions on\ntoxicity, which in turn requires proper stratification of patients as regards\nhow they respond, with or without adverse toxic effects. In summary, the\ntransformation of the ancient concept of dose is currently successfully\noperationalized using rich integrative data encoded in patient-specific models.\n",

However, if flux cost functions are linear and meant to describe\nunderlying enzyme costs, this entails that enzyme efficiencies are constant and\nignores the interplay between fluxes, metabolite concentrations and enzyme\nlevels in cells. Here I introduce realistic flux cost functions that describe\nan \"overhead cost\", namely the minimum enzyme and metabolite cost associated\nwith the fluxes in a kinetic model. These flux cost functions have general\nmathematical properties. Enzymatic flux cost functions, which represent enzyme\ncosts, scale proportionally with the flux profile and are concave on the flux\npolytope. Kinetic flux cost functions represent the sum of enzyme and\nmetabolite costs. If two flux profiles are superimposed, their different\ndemands for metabolite concentrations cause an extra compromise cost, which\nmakes flux cost functions strictly concave in almost all cases. When fluxes\nchange their direction, the enzymatic cost jumps abruptly. Here I propose two\nmethods for flux modelling: Flux Cost Minimisation, a nonlinear variant of FBA\nwith flux minimisation, and Flux Benefit Optimisation, a nonlinear variant of\nFBA with molecular crowding. The optimal flux profiles, at a given flux\nbenefit, are vertices of the flux polytope. Linear approximations of enzymatic\nflux cost can be used in FBA. In contrast to flux costs chosen ad hoc, these\nfunctions reflect the enzyme kinetics and extracellular concentrations in\nrealistic kinetic models. Based on enzymatic flux costs, we can describe the\ncell growth rate as a convex function on the flux polytope and derive\ngrowth-optimal metabolic states and statistical distributions for the fluxes in\ncell populations.\n",

This is particulary true for histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9)\ntrimethylation, that is involved in the maintenance of healthy differentiated\ncellular states by preventing inappropriate gene expression, and has been\nrecently identified as the most efficient barrier to cellular reprogramming in\nnuclear transfer experiments. We propose that the capacity of the enzymes\nSUV39H1/2 to rebind to a minor fraction of their products, either directly or\nvia HP1, contributes to the solidity of this mark through (i) a positive\nfeedback involved in its establishment by the mutual enforcement of H3K9me3 and\nSUV39H1/2 and then (ii) a negative feedback sufficient to strongly stabilize\nH3K9me3 heterochromatin in post-mitotic cells by generating local enzyme\nconcentrations capable of counteracting transient bursts of demethylation. This\nmodel does not require direct molecular interactions with adjacent nucleosomes\nand is favoured by a series of additional mechanisms including (i) the\nprotection of chromatin-bound SUV39H1/2 from the turnovers of soluble proteins,\nwhich can explain the uncoupling between the cellular contents in SUV39H1 mRNA\nand protein; (ii) the cooperative dependence on the local density of the\nH3K9me3 of HP1-dependent heterochomatin condensation and, dispensably (iii)\nrestricted enzyme exchanges with chromocenters confining the reactive bursts of\nSUV39H1/2 in heterochromatin.

These networks have extensively been studied using graphlets, small\ninduced subgraphs capturing the local wiring patterns around nodes in networks.\nThey revealed that proteins involved in similar functions tend to be similarly\nwired. However, such simple models can only represent pairwise relationships\nand cannot fully capture the higher-order organization of protein interactions,\nincluding protein complexes. Results: To model the multi-sale organization of\nthese complex biological systems, we utilize simplicial complexes from\ncomputational geometry. The question is how to mine these new representations\nof PPI networks to reveal additional biological information. To address this,\nwe define simplets, a generalization of graphlets to simplicial complexes. By\nusing simplets, we define a sensitive measure of similarity between simplicial\ncomplex network representations that allows for clustering them according to\ntheir data types better than clustering them by using other state-of-the-art\nmeasures, e.g., spectral distance, or facet distribution distance. We model\nhuman and baker's yeast PPI networks as simplicial complexes that capture PPIs\nand protein complexes as simplices. On these models, we show that our newly\nintroduced simplet-based methods cluster proteins by function better than the\nclustering methods that use the standard PPI networks, uncovering the new\nunderlying functional organization of the cell. We demonstrate the existence of\nthe functional geometry in the PPI data and the superiority of our\nsimplet-based methods to effectively mine for new biological information hidden\nin the complexity of the higher order organization of PPI networks.\n",

However, networks model only pairwise interactions\nbetween molecules and cannot explicitly and directly capture the higher order\nmolecular organisation, such as protein complexes and pathways. Hence, we ask\nif hypergraphs (hypernetworks), that directly capture entire complexes and\npathways along with protein-protein interactions (PPIs), carry additional\nfunctional information beyond what can be uncovered from networks of pairwise\nmolecular interactions. The mathematical formalism of a hypergraph has long\nbeen known, but not often used in studying molecular networks due to the lack\nof sophisticated algorithms for mining the underlying biological information\nhidden in the wiring patterns of molecular systems modelled as hypernetworks.\n  We propose a new, multi-scale, protein interaction hypernetwork model that\nutilizes hypergraphs to capture different scales of protein organization,\nincluding PPIs, protein complexes and pathways. In analogy to graphlets, we\nintroduce hypergraphlets, small, connected, non-isomorphic, induced\nsub-hypergraphs of a hypergraph, to quantify the local wiring patterns of these\nmulti-scale molecular hypergraphs and to mine them for new biological\ninformation. We apply them to model the multi-scale protein networks of baker\nyeast and human and show that the higher order molecular organisation captured\nby these hypergraphs is strongly related to the underlying biology.\nImportantly, we demonstrate that our new models and data mining tools reveal\ndifferent, but complementary biological information compared to classical PPI\nnetworks.

The average sensitivity is a natural\nmeasure of stability in these systems: values below one indicate typically\nstable dynamics associated with an ordered phase, whereas values above one\nindicate chaotic dynamics. This yields a theoretically motivated adaptive\nadvantage to being near the critical value of one, at the boundary between\norder and chaos. Here, we measure average sensitivity for 66 publicly available\nBoolean network models describing the function of gene regulatory circuits\nacross diverse living processes. We find the average sensitivity values for\nthese networks are clustered around unity, indicating they are near critical.\nIn many types of random networks, mean connectivity <K> and the average\nactivity bias of the logic functions <p> have been found to be the most\nimportant network properties in determining average sensitivity, and by\nextension a network's criticality. Surprisingly, many of these gene regulatory\nnetworks achieve the near-critical state with <K> and <p> far from that\npredicted for critical systems: randomized networks sharing the local causal\nstructure and local logic of biological networks better reproduce their\ncritical behavior than controlling for macroscale properties such as <K> and\n<p> alone. This suggests the local properties of genes interacting within\nregulatory networks are selected to collectively be near-critical, and this\nnon-local property of gene regulatory network dynamics cannot be predicted\nusing the density of interactions alone.\n",

However, it is largely unknown, how the complex network regulating\ntoxin expression controls the time-point of toxin release to prevent premature\nrelease of inefficient protein concentrations. Here, we study how different\nregulatory mechanisms affect production and release of the bacteriocin\nColicinE2 in Escherichia coli. Combining experimental and theoretical\napproaches, we demonstrate that the global carbon storage regulator CsrA\ncontrols the duration of the delay between toxin production and release and\nemphasize the importance of CsrA sequestering elements for the timing of\nColicinE2 release. In particular, we show that ssDNA originating from\nrolling-circle replication of the toxin-producing plasmid represents a yet\nunknown additional CsrA sequestering element, which is essential in the\nColicinE2-producing strain to enable toxin release by reducing the amount of\nfree CsrA molecules in the bacterial cell.

A striking example is\nprovided by cyanobacteria, which perform photosynthesis during the day to fix\ncarbon. These organisms not only face the challenge of rewiring their proteome\nevery 12 hours, but also the necessity of storing the fixed carbon in the form\nof glycogen to fuel processes during the night. In this manuscript, we extend\nthe framework developed by Hwa and coworkers (Scott et al., Science 330, 1099\n(2010)) for quantifying the relatinship between growth and proteome composition\nto circadian metabolism. We then apply this framework to investigate the\ncircadian metabolism of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece, which not only fixes\ncarbon during the day, but also nitrogen during the night, storing it in the\npolymer cyanophycin. Our analysis reveals that the need to store carbon and\nnitrogen tends to generate an extreme growth strategy, in which the cells\npredominantly grow during the day, as observed experimentally. This strategy\nmaximizes the growth rate over 24 hours, and can be quantitatively understood\nby the bacterial growth laws. Our analysis also shows that the slow relaxation\nof the proteome, arising from the slow growth rate, puts a severe constraint on\nimplementing this optimal strategy. Yet, the capacity to estimate the time of\nthe day, enabled by the circadian clock, makes it possible to anticipate the\ndaily changes in the environment and mount a response ahead of time. This\nsignificantly enhances the growth rate by counteracting the detrimental effects\nof the slow proteome relaxation.\n",

Large-scale biomedical data generation offers a unique opportunity\nto assess the effect and impact of cellular heterogeneity and environmental\nperturbations on the observed phenotype. Marrying the two, network medicine\nwith biomedical data provides a framework to build meaningful models and\nextract impactful results at a network level. In this review, we survey\nexisting network types and biomedical data sources. More importantly, we delve\ninto ways in which the network medicine approach, aided by phenotype-specific\nbiomedical data, can be gainfully applied. We provide three paradigms, mainly\ndealing with three major biological network archetypes: protein-protein\ninteraction, expression-based, and gene regulatory networks. For each of these\nparadigms, we discuss a broad overview of philosophies under which various\nnetwork methods work. We also provide a few examples in each paradigm as a test\ncase of its successful application. Finally, we delineate several opportunities\nand challenges in the field of network medicine. Taken together, the\nunderstanding gained from combining biomedical data with networks can be useful\nfor characterizing disease etiologies and identifying therapeutic targets,\nwhich, in turn, will lead to better preventive medicine with translational\nimpacts on personalized healthcare.\n",

Here, we present a theoretical model that yields the product\nnumber counting statistics of product creation occurring in bursts and of a\nnon-renewal creation process. When product creation is a stationary process,\nour model confirms that product number fluctuation decreases with an increase\nin the product lifetime fluctuation, originating from the non-Poisson\ndegradation dynamics, a result obtained in previous work. Our model\nadditionally demonstrates that the dependence of product number fluctuation on\nproduct lifetime fluctuation varies with time, when product creation is a\nnon-stationary process. We find that bursting increases product number\nfluctuation, compared to birth-processes without bursting. At time zero, in a\nburst-less birth process, product number fluctuation is unsurprisingly found to\nbe zero, but we discover that, in a bulk creation process characterized by\nbursting, product number fluctuation is a finite value at time zero. The\nanalytic expressions we obtain are applicable to many fields related to the\nstudy system population, such as queueing models and gene expression.\n",

Reaction\nrates are different whenever chemical reaction occurs due to their dependence\non the number of reaction events or the product number. As such, understanding\nthe impact of rate fluctuation on product number counting statistics is of the\nutmost importance when developing a quantitative explanation of chemical\nreactions. In this work, we present a master equation that describes reaction\nrates as a function of product number and time. Our equal reveals the\nrelationship between the reaction rate and product number fluctuation. Product\nnumber counting statistics uncovers a stochastic property of the product\nnumber; product number directly manipulates the reaction rate. Specifically, we\nfind that product number shows super-Poisson characteristics when the product\nnumber increases, inducing an increase in the reaction rate. While, on the\nother hand, when the product number shows sub-Poisson characteristics with an\nincrease in the product number, this is induced by a decrease in the reaction\nrate. Furthermore, our analysis exploits reaction rate fluctuation, enabling\nthe quantification of the deviation of an elementary reaction process from a\nrenewal process.\n",

This paper proposes a new finite\ndifference method for efficiently computing sensitivities of biochemical\nreactions. We employ propensity bounds of reactions to couple the simulation of\nthe nominal and perturbed processes. The exactness of the simulation is\nreserved by applying the rejection-based mechanism. For each simulation step,\nthe nominal and perturbed processes under our coupling strategy are\nsynchronized and often jump together, increasing their positive correlation and\nhence reducing the variance of the estimator. The distinctive feature of our\napproach in comparison with existing coupling approaches is that it only needs\nto maintain a single data structure storing propensity bounds of reactions\nduring the simulation of the nominal and perturbed processes. Our approach\nallows to computing sensitivities of many reaction rates simultaneously.\nMoreover, the data structure does not require to be updated frequently, hence\nimproving the computational cost. This feature is especially useful when\napplied to large reaction networks. We benchmark our method on biological\nreaction models to prove its applicability and efficiency.\n",

In this study,\nthus, we evaluate whether the modularity--robustness hypothesis is applicable\nto cancer using network analysis. We focus on 14 specific cancer types whose\nmolecular signaling networks are available in databases, and show that modular\norganization of cancer signaling networks is associated with the patient\nsurvival rate. In particular, the cancers with less modular signaling networks\nare more curable. This result is consistent with a prediction from the\nmodularity--robustness hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that the network\nmodularity is a better descriptor of the patient survival rate than the\nheterogeneous connectivity. However, these results do not contradict the\nimportance of the heterogeneous connectivity. Rather, they provide new and\ndifferent insights into the relationship between cellular networks and cancer\nbehaviors.

Many of\nexisting LP methods rely on shared immediate neighborhoods of the nodes to be\nlinked. As such, they have limitations. Thus, in order to comprehensively study\nwhat are the topological properties of nodes in PINs that dictate whether the\nnodes should be linked, we had to introduce novel sensitive LP measures that\novercome the limitations of the existing methods.\n  We systematically evaluate the new and existing LP measures by introducing\n\"synthetic\" noise to PINs and measuring how well the different measures\nreconstruct the original PINs. Our main findings are: 1) LP measures that favor\nnodes which are both \"topologically similar\" and have large shared extended\nneighborhoods are superior; 2) using more network topology often though not\nalways improves LP accuracy; and 3) our new LP measures are superior to the\nexisting measures. After evaluating the different methods, we use them to\nde-noise PINs.

While several feedback\nloops have been shown to regulate EMT, it remains elusive how they coordinately\nmodulate EMT response to TGF-\\beta treatment. We construct a mathematical model\nfor the core regulatory network controlling TGF-\\beta-induced EMT. Through\ndeterministic analyses and stochastic simulations, we show that EMT is a\nsequential two-step program that an epithelial cell first transits to partial\nEMT then to the mesenchymal state, depending on the strength and duration of\nTGF-\\beta stimulation. Mechanistically the system is governed by coupled\nreversible and irreversible bistable switches. The SNAIL1/miR-34 double\nnegative feedback loop is responsible for the reversible switch and regulates\nthe initiation of EMT, while the ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop is accountable for\nthe irreversible switch and controls the establishment of the mesenchymal\nstate. Furthermore, an autocrine TGF-\\beta/miR-200 feedback loop makes the\nsecond switch irreversible, modulating the maintenance of EMT. Such coupled\nbistable switches are robust to parameter variation and molecular noise. We\nprovide a mechanistic explanation on multiple experimental observations. The\nmodel makes several explicit predictions on hysteretic dynamic behaviors,\nsystem response to pulsed stimulation and various perturbations, which can be\nstraightforwardly tested.\n",

Here I assume an optimal allocation of enzyme resources\nand postulate a general principle for metabolism: each enzyme must convert less\nvaluable into more valuable metabolites to justify its own cost. The \"values\",\ncalled economic potentials, describe the individual contributions of\nmetabolites to cell fitness. Local value production implies that the cost of an\nenzyme must be balanced by a benefit, given by the economic potential\ndifference the catalysed reaction multiplied by the flux. Flux profiles that\nsatisfy this principle - i.e. for which consistent potentials can be found -\nare called economical. Economical fluxes must lead from lower to higher\neconomic potentials, so certain flux cycles are incompatible with any choice of\neconomic potentials and can be excluded. To obtain economical flux profiles,\nnon-beneficial local patterns, called futile motifs, can be systematically\nremoved from a given flux distribution. The principle of local value production\nresembles thermodynamic principles and complements them in models. Here I\ndescribe a modelling framework called Value Balance Analysis (VBA) that uses\nthe two principles and yields the same solution as enzyme cost minimisation (in\nkinetic models) and flux cost minimisation (in FBA). Given an economical flux\ndistribution, kinetic models in enzyme-optimal states and with these fluxes can\nbe constructed systematically. VBA justifies the principle of minimal fluxes\nand the exclusion of futile cycles, predicts enzymes that could be plausible\ntargets for regulation, provides criteria for the usage of enzymes and\npathways, and explains the choice between high-yield and low-yield flux modes.\n",

Our kinetic model, developed using the ideas of\nchemical network theory, leads to a system of nine coupled equations that we\nsolve both by direct and by stochastic (Gillespie) methods. Both the analyses\nconsistently provide detail information on the dependence of immune response to\nthe variation of critical rate parameters. We find that although vitamin-D\nplays a negligible role in the initial immune response, it exerts a profound\ninfluence in the long term, especially in helping the system to achieve a new,\nstable steady state. The study explores the role of vitamin-D in preserving an\nobserved bistability in the phase diagram (spanned by system parameters) of\nimmune regulation, thus allowing the response to tolerate a wide range of\npathogenic stimulation which could help in resisting autoimmune diseases. We\nalso study how vitamin-D affects the time dependent population of dendritic\ncells that connect between innate and adaptive immune responses. Variations in\ndose dependent response in anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory T-cell\npopulations to vitamin-D correlate well with recent experimental results. Our\nkinetic model allows for an estimation of the range of optimum level of\nvitamin-D required for smooth functioning of the immune system and for control\nof both hyper-regulation and inflammation. Most importantly, the present study\nreveals that an overdose or toxic level of vitamin-D or any steroid analogue\ncould give rise to too large a tolerant response, leading to an inefficacy in\nadaptive immune function.\n",

This hypothesis and its consequences can be studied by\ncomputational models and using a theory of metabolic value. In optimal\nmetabolic states, any increase of an enzyme level must improve the metabolic\nperformance to justify its own cost, so each active enzyme must contribute to\nthe cell's benefit by producing valuable products. This principle of value\nproduction leads to variation rules that relate metabolic fluxes and reaction\nelasticities to enzyme costs. Metabolic value theory provides a language to\ndescribe this. It postulates a balance of local values, which I derive here\nfrom concepts of metabolic control theory. Economic state variables, called\neconomic potentials and loads, describe how metabolites, reactions, and enzymes\ncontribute to metabolic performance. Economic potentials describe the indirect\nvalue of metabolite production, while economic loads describe the indirect\nvalue of metabolite concentrations. These economic variables, and others, are\nlinked by local balance equations. These laws for optimal metabolic states\ndefine conditions for metabolic fluxes that hold for a wide range of rate laws.\nTo produce metabolic value, fluxes run from lower to higher economic\npotentials, must be free of futile cycles, and satisfy a principle of minimal\nweighted fluxes.

Examples include metabolism where a handful of building blocks\nmediate between multiple input nutrients and multiple output biomass\ncomponents, and signaling networks where information from numerous receptor\ntypes passes through a small set of signaling pathways to regulate multiple\noutput genes. Little is known, however, about how bow-tie architectures evolve.\nHere, we address the evolution of bow-tie architectures using simulations of\nmulti-layered systems evolving to fulfill a given input-output goal. We find\nthat bow-ties spontaneously evolve when two conditions are met: (i) the\nevolutionary goal is rank deficient, where the rank corresponds to the minimal\nnumber of input features on which the outputs depend, and (ii) The effects of\nmutations on interaction intensities between components are described by\nproduct rule - namely the mutated element is multiplied by a random number.\nProduct-rule mutations are more biologically realistic than the commonly used\nsum-rule mutations that add a random number to the mutated element. These\nconditions robustly lead to bow-tie structures. The minimal width of the\nintermediate network layers (the waist or knot of the bow-tie) equals the rank\nof the evolutionary goal.

This has\nmotivated numerous coarse-grained schemes, where the \"fast\" reactions are\napproximated either using Langevin dynamics or deterministically.

These studies have potential in\nenabling rational strain design. Unfortunately, experimentally determined\nintracellular flux distribution are often inconsistent or incomparable due to\ndifferent experimental conditions and methodologies. Computational strain\ndesign relies on constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA)\ntechniques to predict the effect of gene knockouts such as flux balance\nanalysis (FBA), regulatory on/off minimization(ROOM), minimization of metabolic\nadjustment (MOMA), relative optimality in metabolic networks (RELATCH). Most of\nthese knock-out prediction methods are based on conserving inherent flux\npatterns (between wild type and mutant) that are thought to be representative\nof the cellular regulatory structure. However, it has been recently\ndemonstrated that these methods show poor agreement with experimental data. To\nimprove the fidelity of knockout predictions and subsequent computational\nstrain design, we developed REMEP, a metabolite-centric method. We demonstrate\nthe improved performance of REMEP by comparing the different methods on\nexperimental knockout data of E. coli, and S. cerevisiae grown in batch\ncultures. REMEP retains most of the features of earlier algorithms but is much\nmore accurate in capturing cellular responses to genetic perturbations.

Our approach, which is\nnamed Unified Sparse Dynamics Learning (USDL), constitutes of two steps. First,\nan atemporal system of equations is derived through the application of the weak\nformulation.

The gene turns into inactive\nstate as the bound transcription factors leave the promoter. During the active\nperiod of the gene, many RNAP molecules transcribe the gene to synthesize the\nmRNAs. The binding event of RNAP to the active state of the gene is a\nprobabilistic process and therefore, introduces noise or fluctuations in the\nmRNA and protein levels.

It decreases the mean and Fano factor both\nat the mRNA levels in the constitutive network whereas in other networks it can\nsimultaneously increase or decrease both quantities or it can have mixed-effect\nat mRNA levels. We propose that a constitutive network with reinitiation\nbehaves like a product independent negative feedback circuit whereas other\nnetworks behave as either product independent positive or negative or mixed\nfeedback circuit.\n",

We identified the most important\nproteins in both networks, those that have the maximal value of calculated\ninvariants, these proteins are considered as the most: affected, connected or\nthose that best monitor the flow of information in the network, among them we\nfind UBC, a human protein related with ubiquination, linked with different\nstages of coronavirus disease, and ORF7A a virus protein that induces apoptosis\nin infected cells, associated with virion tethering.

First, we derive exact expressions needed to sample the\nnext reaction time and reaction type, and then give two examples of how a GRN\ncan be partitioned. Although the methods presented here can be applied to a\nvariety of different stochastic systems within GRN, we focus on simulating\nmRNAs in particular. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this\nalgorithm, we apply it to a three-gene oscillator, first in one cell, and then\nin an array of cells (up to 64 cells) interacting via molecular diffusion, and\ncompare its performance to the Gillespie algorithm (GA). Depending on the\nparticular numerical values of the system parameters, and the partitioning\nitself, we show that our algorithm is between 11 and 445 times faster than the\nGA.\n",

SSMs have been\nrecently used to compare genes and proteins even on a system level scale.

Experimental\nevidences of phenotypic differentiation are given by the presence of bimodal\ndistributions of gene expression levels, where the modes of the distribution\noften correspond to different physiological states of the system. We\ntheoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of\nmicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules\nthat downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this\ninteraction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target\ntranscription rate no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We\ninvestigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a\nfluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic\nnoise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be\nobserved for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic\nnoise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest\nthat combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a\nsimple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations not requiring\nfine tuning.

However, we show that this assumption does not hold well.\nSo, a paradigm shift is needed with how the NA problem is approached. We\nredefine NA as a data-driven framework, TARA (daTA-dRiven network Alignment),\nwhich attempts to learn the relationship between topological relatedness and\nfunctional relatedness without assuming that topological relatedness\ncorresponds to topological similarity, like traditional NA methods do. TARA\ntrains a classifier to predict whether two nodes from different networks are\nfunctionally related based on their network topological patterns. We find that\nTARA is able to make accurate predictions. TARA then takes each pair of nodes\nthat are predicted as related to be part of an alignment. Like traditional NA\nmethods, TARA uses this alignment for the across-species transfer of functional\nknowledge. Clearly, TARA as currently implemented uses topological but not\nprotein sequence information for this task. We find that TARA outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art NA methods that also use topological information,\nWAVE and SANA, and even outperforms or complements a state-of-the-art NA method\nthat uses both topological and sequence information, PrimAlign.

Some algorithms, including ARACNE and Phixer, approach\nthis problem by using pruning methods to eliminate redundant edges in an\nattempt to explain the observed data with the simplest possible network\nstructure. However, we hypothesize that there may be a cost in accuracy to\nsimplifying the predicted networks in this way, especially due to the\nprevalence of redundant connections, such as feed forward loops, in gene\nnetworks. In this paper, we evaluate the pruning methods of ARACNE and Phixer,\nand score their accuracy using receiver operating characteristic curves and\nprecision-recall curves. Our results suggest that while pruning can be useful\nin some situations, it may have a negative effect on overall accuracy that has\nnot been previously studied.

To address this we use a benchmark three\nprotein oscillator design - the repressilator - and investigate its robustness\nto pulse perturbations, computationally as well as using analytical tools of\nFloquet theory.

Here, we present a theory for the optimal design of\na large class of sensing systems that need to detect time-varying signals, a\nreceptor driving a push-pull network. The theory is based on the concept of the\ndynamic input-output relation, which describes the mapping between the current\nligand concentration and the average receptor occupancy over the past\nintegration time. This concept is used to develop the idea that the cell\nemploys its push-pull network to estimate the receptor occupancy and then uses\nthis estimate to infer the current ligand concentration by inverting the\ndynamic input-output relation. The theory reveals that the sensing error can be\ndecomposed into two terms: the sampling error in the estimate of the receptor\noccupancy and the dynamical error that arises because the average ligand\nconcentration over the past integration time may not reflect the current ligand\nconcentration. The theory generalizes the design principle of optimal resource\nallocation previously identified for static signals, which states that in an\noptimally designed sensing system the three fundamental resource classes of\nreceptors and their integration time, readout molecules, and energy are equally\nlimiting so that no resource is wasted. However, in contrast to static signals,\nreceptors and power cannot be traded freely against time to reach a desired\nsensing precision: there exists an optimal integration time that maximizes the\nsensing precision, which depends on the number of receptors, the receptor\ncorrelation time, and the correlation time and variance of the input signal.\nApplying our theory to the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli indicates that\nthis bacterium has evolved to optimally sense shallow gradients.\n",

Under reasonable biophysical assumptions, we find that\nthe optimal design will saturate the bound on the minimal flux, and reflects a\nbasic trade-off in catalytic operation.

If both binding free energies are too low, there is high\nsequestration, and the reaction flux may also be suppressed in extreme cases.\nThe optimal binding free energies are therefore neither too high nor too low,\nbut in fact moderate. Moreover, the optimal difference in substrate and product\nbinding free energies, which contributes to the thermodynamic driving force of\nthe reaction, is in general strongly constrained by the intrinsic free-energy\ndifference between products and reactants. Both the strategies of using a\nnegative binding free-energy difference to drive the catalyst-bound reaction\nforward, and of using a positive binding free-energy difference to enhance\ndetachment of the product, are limited in their efficacy.\n",

Consequently, a large amount of research\ninto the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in\na short time frame. However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy\nprocess, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug\nrepurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs\nhave already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. In this work we\nused a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search\nintegrated knowledge graphs, identifying drug repurposing opportunities for\nCOVID-19. We demonstrate the value of this approach, reporting on eight\npotential repurposing opportunities identified, and discuss how this approach\ncould be incorporated into future studies.\n",

These fundamental\nquestions are closely related to a deeply rooted paradigm in developmental\nbiology that cell differentiation is irreversible. Yet, recently a growing body\nof research suggests the possibility of cell reprogramming, which offers the\npotential for us to convert one type of cell into another. Despite the\nsignificance of quantitative understandings of cell reprogramming, theoretical\nefforts often suffer from the complexity of large circuits maintaining cell\nphenotypes coupled at many different epigenetic and gene regulation levels. To\ncapture the global architecture of cell phenotypes, we propose an \"epigenetic\nstate network\" approach that translates the classical concept of an epigenetic\nlandscape into a simple-yet-predictive mathematical model. As a testing case,\nwe apply the approach to the reprogramming of fibroblasts (FB) to\ncardiomyocytes (CM). The epigenetic state network for this case predicts three\nmajor pathways of reprogramming. One pathway goes by way of induced pluripotent\nstem cells (iPSC) and continues on to the normal pathway of cardiomyocyte\ndifferentiation. The other two pathways involve transdifferentiation (TD)\neither indirectly through cardiac progenitor (CP) cells or directly from\nfibroblast to cardiomyocyte.

Due to the fluctuations caused by\nthese features, the system behavior can be quite different from the one\nobtained by rate equations, because the rate equations ignore molecular\nfluctuations and thus are exact only in the infinite molecular number limit.\nThe molecular fluctuations on a free-running circadian system have been studied\nby Gonze et al.

They consider, however, only the first effect, assuming that the gene\nprocess is fast enough for the second effect to be ignored, but this has not\nbeen examined systematically yet. In this work, we study fluctuation effects\ndue to the finite gene regulation time by introducing a new scale parameter\n$\\tau$, which we take as the unbinding time of a nuclear protein from the gene.\nWe focus on the case where the fluctuations due to small molecular numbers can\nbe ignored. In simulations on the same system studied by Gonze et al., we find\nthe system is sensitive to the fluctuation in the transcription regulation; the\nperiod of oscillation fluctuates about 30 min even when the regulation time\nscale $\\tau$ is around 30 s, that is even smaller than 1/1000 of its circadian\nperiod. We also demonstrate that the distribution width for the oscillation\nperiod and the amplitude scales with $\\sqrt\\tau$, and the correlation time of\nthe oscillation scales with $1/\\tau$ in the small $\\tau$ regime.

As bond graphs have been widely used to model,\nanalyse and synthesise engineering systems, this paper suggests that they can\nplay the same role in the modelling, analysis and synthesis of biomolecular\nsystems. The particular structure of bond graphs arising from biomolecular\nsystems is established and used to elucidate the relation between\nthermodynamically closed and open systems. Block diagram representations of the\ndynamics implied by these bond graphs are used to reveal implicit feedback\nstructures and are linearised to allow the application of control-theoretical\nmethods.\n  Two concepts of modularity are examined: computational modularity where\nphysical correctness is retained and behavioural modularity where module\nbehaviour (such as ultrasensitivity) is retained. As well as providing\ncomputational modularity, bond graphs provide a natural formulation of\nbehavioural modularity and reveal the sources of retroactivity. A bond graph\napproach to reducing retroactivity, and thus inter-module interaction, is shown\nto require a power supply such as that provided by the ATP = ADP + Pi reaction.\n  The MAPK cascade (Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) is used as an illustrative example.\n",

With suitable inputs, PPI networks\ndrive the cells to diverse functional outcomes such as cell proliferation or\ncell death. Here we characterize the structural controllability of a large\ndirected human PPI network comprised of 6,339 proteins and 34,813 interactions.\nThis allows us to classify proteins as \"indispensable\", \"neutral\" or\n\"dispensable\", which correlates to increasing, no effect, or decreasing the\nnumber of driver nodes in the network upon removal of that protein.

A strong focus\nwas put on the analysis of the basic data to analyze how the cooperative\nphenomena might be imprinted in the TMA data structure. The study design was\nbased on two independent panels of 589 and 366 invasive breast cancer cases\nfrom different institutions, assembled on tissue microarrays. The combinatorial\nanalysis generates an optimal rank ordering of protein-expression coherence.\nThe outcome of the analysis corresponds to all the single observations\nscattered over several publications and integrates them in one context. This\nmeans all these scattered observations can also be deduced from one TMA\nexperiment. A comprehensive statistical meta-analysis of the TMA data suggests\nthe existence of a superposition of three basic coherence situations, and\noffers the opportunity to analyze these data properties with additional\nreal-world data and synthetic data in more detail. The presented algorithm\ngives molecular pathologists a tool to extract dependency information from TMA\ndata.

Although the structure of\nGRNs has been the subject of many studies, their large scale structure in the\nlight of feedbacks from the metabolic network (MN) has received relatively\nlittle attention. Here we study the causal structure of the GRNs, namely the\nchain of influence of one component on the other, taking into account feedback\nfrom the MN. First we consider the GRNs of E. coli and B. subtilis without\nfeedback from MN and illustrate their causal structure. Next we augment the\nGRNs with feedback from their respective MNs by including (a) links from genes\ncoding for enzymes to metabolites produced or consumed in reactions catalyzed\nby those enzymes and (b) links from metabolites to genes coding for\ntranscription factors whose transcriptional activity the metabolites alter by\nbinding to them. We find that the inclusion of feedback from MN into GRN\nsignificantly affects its causal structure, in particular the number of levels\nand relative positions of nodes in the hierarchy, and the number and size of\nthe strongly connected components (SCCs). We then study the functional\nsignificance of the SCCs. For this we identify condition specific feedbacks\nfrom the MN into the GRN by retaining only those enzymes that are essential for\ngrowth in specific environmental conditions simulated via the technique of flux\nbalance analysis (FBA). We find that the SCCs of the GRN augmented by these\nfeedbacks can be ascribed specific functional roles in the organism. Our\nalgorithmic approach thus reveals relatively autonomous subsystems with\nspecific functionality, or regulatory modules in the organism. This automated\napproach could be useful in identifying biologically relevant modules in other\norganisms for which network data is available, but whose biology is less well\nstudied.\n",

Meanwhile, synthetic biologists have\ndesigned Turing systems for implementation in cell colonies, but none have yet\nled to visible patterns in the laboratory. In both cases, the relationship\nbetween underlying chemistry and emergent biology remains mysterious. To help\nresolve the mystery, this article asks the question: what kinds of biochemical\nsystems can generate Turing patterns? We find general conditions for Turing\npattern inception -- the ability to generate unstable patterns from random\nnoise -- which may lead to the ultimate formation of stable patterns, depending\non biochemical non-linearities. We find that a wide variety of systems can\ngenerate stable Turing patterns, including several which are currently unknown,\nsuch as two-species systems composed of two self-activators, and systems\ncomposed of a short-range inhibitor and a long-range activator. We furthermore\nfind that systems which are widely believed to generate stable patterns may in\nfact only generate unstable patterns, which ultimately converge to\nspatially-homogeneous concentrations. Our results suggest that a much wider\nvariety of systems than is commonly believed could be responsible for observed\npatterns in development, or could be good candidates for synthetic patterning\nnetworks.\n",

Scale-free networks may provide an explanation for\nthe robustness observed in certain physical and biological phenomena, since the\npresence of a few highly connected hub nodes and a large number of small-\ndegree nodes may provide alternate paths between any two nodes on average --\nsuch robustness has been suggested in studies of metabolic networks, gene\ninteraction networks and protein folding. A theoretical justification for why\nbiological networks are often found to be scale-free may lie in the well-known\nfact that expanding networks in which new nodes are preferentially attached to\nhighly connected nodes tend to be scale-free. In this paper, we provide the\nfirst efficient algorithm to compute the connectivity density function for the\nensemble of all secondary structures of a user-specified length, and show both\nby computational and theoretical arguments that preferential attachment holds\nwhen expanding the network from length n to length n + 1 structures.

Therefore, it has been suggested\nthat robustness against extrinsic noise increases with the level of the\nintrinsic noise. We call this phenomenon intrinsic noise-induced robustness\n(INIR). As previous studies on this phenomenon have focused on complex\nbiochemical reactions, the relation between INIR and the input--output of a\nsystem is unclear. Moreover, the mechanism of INIR remains elusive. In this\npaper, we address these questions by analyzing simple models. We first analyze\na model in which the input--output relation is linear. We show that the\nrobustness against extrinsic noise increases with the intrinsic noise,\nconfirming the INIR phenomenon. Moreover, the robustness against the extrinsic\nnoise is more strongly dependent on the intrinsic noise when the variance of\nthe intrinsic noise is larger than that of the input distribution. Next, we\nanalyze a threshold model in which the output depends on whether the input\nexceeds the threshold. When the threshold is equal to the mean of the input,\nINIR is realized, but when the threshold is much larger than the mean, the\nthreshold model exhibits stochastic resonance, and INIR is not always apparent.\nThe robustness against extrinsic noise and the transmitted information can be\ntraded off against one another in the linear model and the threshold model\nwithout stochastic resonance, whereas they can be simultaneously increased in\nthe threshold model with stochastic resonance.\n",

In a systematic and comprehensive evaluation, we find that in many\nof the evaluation tests: (i) using an aging-specific subnetwork indeed yields\nmore accurate aging-related gene predictions than using the entire network, and\n(ii) predictive methods from our framework that have not previously been used\nfor supervised prediction of aging-related genes outperform existing prominent\nmethods for the same purpose.\n  Conclusion. These results justify the need for our framework.\n",

Citrate is\na Krebs cycle metabolite produced in the condensation reaction between\nacetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate in the mitochondria of the cell. With the\napplication of $^{13}$C enriched substrates, such as $^{13}$C glucose or\npyruvate, to prostate cells or tissues, it is possible to identify the\ncontributions of different metabolic pathways to this production and secretion\nof citrate. In this work we present a quantitative model describing the\nmitochondrial production and the secretion of citrate by prostatic epithelial\ncells employing the $^{13}$C labeling pattern of secreted citrate as readout.\nWe derived equations for the secretion fraction of citrate and the contribution\nof pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) versus the anaplerotic pyruvate\ncarboxylase (PC) pathways in supplying the Krebs cycle with carbons from\npyruvate for the production of citrate. These measures are independent of\ninitial $^{13}$C-enrichment of the administered supplements and of $^{13}$C\nJ-coupling patterns, making this method robust also if SNR is low. We propose\nuse of these equations to distinguish between citrate metabolism in healthy and\ndiseased prostate tissue, in particular upon malignant transformation.\n",

We provide a closed formula for the\nderivatives that accommodates common perturbations, and illustrate its form\nwith numerous examples. We argue that, mathematically, the study of the\nresponse to the system with respect to changes in total amounts is not well\nposed, and that one should rather consider perturbations with respect to the\ninitial conditions. We find a sign-based criterion to determine, without\ncomputing the sensitivities, whether the sign depends on the steady state and\nparameters of the system. This is based on earlier results of so-called\ninjective networks. Finally, we address systems with multiple steady states and\nthe restriction to stable steady states.\n",

These distributions are determined\nprimarily by the multitude of states of a gene promoter, each driving\ntranscription at a different rate. In an era where single-cell mRNA copy number\ndata are more and more available, there is an increasing need for fast\ncomputations of mRNA distributions. In this paper, we present a method for\ncomputing separate distributions for each species of mRNA molecules, i. e.\nmRNAs that have been either partially or fully processed post-transcription.\nThe method involves the integration over all possible realizations of promoter\nstates, which we cast into a set of linear ordinary differential equations of\ndimension $M\\times n_j$, where $M$ is the number of available promoter states\nand $n_j$ is the mRNA copy number of species $j$ up to which one wishes to\ncompute the probability distribution.

Accumulating data suggest that this\npoorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon\nMetabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA)\nis intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises\na catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to\nproduce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function.\nInterestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is\nhomologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a\nconserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and\ncatalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in\nreplication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown\nin a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth.\nMeasurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork\nspeed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit\nreplication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein\nrather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and\nPEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively\nand negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a\nprocess depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues\nbinding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and\nbelonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of\nPykA in replication. In vitro , PykA affects the activities of replication\nenzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for\ninitiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA . Our results thus\nconnect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and\nADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and\nthe replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed\nwith a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling\nmetabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the\ncellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication\ninitiation and elongation to metabolism. This defines a new type of replication\nregulator proposed to be part of the metabolic control that gates replication\nin the cell cycle.\n",

Here we explore the interplay between\nthree-dimensional structure and transcriptional activity at the single cell\nlevel. We show that inactive loci are spatially more compact than active ones,\nand that within active loci the enhancer driving transcription is closest to\nthe promoter. On the other hand, even this shortest distance is too long to\nsupport direct physical contact between the enhancer-promoter pair when the\nlocus is transcriptionally active. Artificial manipulation of genomic\nseparations between enhancers and the promoter produces changes in physical\ndistance and transcriptional activity, recapitulating the correlation seen in\nwild-type embryos, but disruption of topological domain boundaries has no\neffect. Our results suggest a complex interdependence between transcription and\nthe spatial organization of cis-regulatory elements.\n",

These controllers\ncan maintain accuracy in spite of the uncertainties in the controlled networks.\nHowever, this desirable feature is achieved only if stability is also\nmaintained. In this paper, we show that molecular IFCs can suffer from a\nhazardous instability called negative-equilibrium catastrophe (NEC), whereby\nall nonnegative equilibria vanish under the action of the controllers, and some\nof the molecular abundances blow up. We show that unimolecular IFCs do not\nexist due to a NEC. We then derive a family of bimolecular IFCs that are\nsafeguarded against NECs when uncertain unimolecular networks, with any number\nof molecular species, are controlled. However, when IFCs are applied on\nuncertain bimolecular (and hence most intracellular) networks, we show that\npreventing NECs generally becomes an intractable problem as the number of\ninteracting molecular species increases.\n",

Although gene regulation is a central topic in\nbiology, autoregulation is much less studied. In general, it is extremely\ndifficult to determine the existence of autoregulation with direct biochemical\napproaches. Nevertheless, some papers have observed that certain types of\nautoregulations are linked to noise levels in gene expression. We generalize\nthese results by two propositions on discrete-state continuous-time Markov\nchains. These two propositions form a simple but robust method to infer the\nexistence of autoregulation in certain scenarios from gene expression data.\nThis method only depends on the Fano factor, namely the ratio of variance and\nmean of the gene expression level. Compared to other methods for inferring\nautoregulation, our method only requires non-interventional one-time data, and\ndoes not need to estimate parameters. Besides, our method has few restrictions\non the model. We apply this method to four groups of experimental data and find\nsome genes that might have autoregulation.

While perturbation\ntheory is a standard mathematical tool to analyze the different time scales of\na dynamical system, and decompose the system accordingly, tropical methods\nprovide a simple algebraic framework to perform these analyses systematically\nin polynomial systems. The crux of these tropicalization methods is in the\ncomputation of tropical equilibrations. In this paper we show that\nconstraint-based methods, using reified constraints for expressing the\nequilibration conditions, make it possible to numerically solve non-linear\ntropical equilibration problems, out of reach of standard computation methods.\nWe illustrate this approach first with the reduction of simple biochemical\nmechanisms such as the Michaelis-Menten and Goldbeter-Koshland models, and\nsecond, with performance figures obtained on a large scale on the model\nrepository \\texttt{biomodels.net}\n",

Increasing evidence indicates that these\ntranscriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) in bacteria have an inherently\nhierarchical architecture, although the design principles and the specific\nadvantages offered by this type of organization have not yet been fully\nelucidated. In this study, we focussed on the hierarchical structure of the TRN\nof the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and performed a comparative\nanalysis with the TRN of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Using a\ngraph-theoretic approach, we organized the transcription factors (TFs) and\nsigma-factors in the TRNs of B. subtilis and E. coli into three hierarchical\nlevels (Top, Middle and Bottom) and studied several structural and functional\nproperties across them. In addition to many similarities, we found also\nspecific differences, explaining the majority of them with variations in the\ndistribution of sigma-factors across the hierarchical levels in the two\norganisms. We then investigated the control of target metabolic genes by\ntranscriptional regulators to characterize the differential regulation of three\ndistinct metabolic subsystems (catabolism, anabolism and central energy\nmetabolism). These results suggest that the hierarchical architecture that we\nobserved in B. subtilis represents an effective organization of its TRN to\nachieve flexibility in the response to diverse stimuli.\n",

Different\nmethods use both different NCFs and different ASs. Thus, it is unclear whether\nthe superiority of a method comes from its NCF, its AS, or both. We already\nshowed on MI-GRAAL and IsoRankN that combining NCF of one method and AS of\nanother method can lead to a new superior method. Here, we evaluate MI-GRAAL\nagainst newer GHOST to potentially further improve alignment quality. Also, we\napproach several important questions that have not been asked systematically\nthus far. First, we ask how much of the node similarity information in NCF\nshould come from sequence data compared to topology data. Existing methods\ndetermine this more-less arbitrarily, which could affect the resulting\nalignment(s). Second, when topology is used in NCF, we ask how large the size\nof the neighborhoods of the compared nodes should be. Existing methods assume\nthat larger neighborhood sizes are better.\n  We find that MI-GRAAL's NCF is superior to GHOST's NCF, while the performance\nof the methods' ASs is data-dependent. Thus, the combination of MI-GRAAL's NCF\nand GHOST's AS could be a new superior method for certain data. Also, which\namount of sequence information is used within NCF does not affect alignment\nquality, while the inclusion of topological information is crucial. Finally,\nlarger neighborhood sizes are preferred, but often, it is the second largest\nsize that is superior, and using this size would decrease computational\ncomplexity.\n  Together, our results give several general recommendations for a fair\nevaluation of network alignment methods.\n",

Recently researchers developed the\nquasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape.

However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for\ncontinuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are\nimportant tools to study complex systems.

We apply our\nframework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models\nis considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development.\nWe impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to\nspecific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to\nstable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas\ndevelopment. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint\ncorresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to\nrestrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class.

This\nextremely low computational demand opens new possibilities for improving the\nquality of the models. Several rounds of model reconstruction, testing of the\nmodel's predictions against real experimental data, curation steps of the input\nmodel and the set of core reactions as well as cross-validations assays are\nrequired to reconstruct high-quality models. These semi-automated model\ncurations steps are in such extend not possible with competing algorithms due\nto their high computational demands. To adapt FASTCORE for the integration of\nmicroarray data, we therefore propose a new workflow: FASTCORMICS. FASTCORMICS\nrequires as input microarray data and a Genome-scale reconstruction.\nFASTCORMICS is devoid of heuristic parameter settings and has a low\ncomputational demand with overall building times in the order of a few minutes.\nFASTCORMICS preprocesses the microarrays data with the discretization tool\nBarcode (Zillox et al, 2007). Barcode uses prior knowledge on the intensity\ndistribution of each probe set for a given microarray platform to segregate\nbetween expressed genes and non-expressed genes. This preprocessing step allows\ncircumventing the need of setting a heuristic expression threshold, which is\ncritical for the output models as in response to this threshold alternative\npathways or subsystems might be included or excluded, thereby heavily changing\nthe functionalities of the model.\n  In general, FASTCORMICS outperforms competing algorithms and allows obtaining\nhigh-quality, robust models in a high-throughput manner.

Typically, one measures the amount of conserved edges, but only after\nalignments are produced. Hence, a recent attempt aimed to directly maximize the\namount of conserved edges while constructing alignments, which improved\nalignment accuracy.

As\na result, we introduce a novel AS, Weighted Alignment VotEr (WAVE), which can\noptimize any measures of node and edge conservation, and which can be used with\nany NCF or combination of multiple NCFs.

Alignments between these networks aid\nfunctional understanding as they uncover important information, such as\nevolutionary conserved pathways, protein complexes and functional orthologs.\nThe objective of a multiple network alignment is to create clusters of nodes\nthat are evolutionarily conserved and functionally consistent across all\nnetworks. Unfortunately, the alignment methods proposed thus far do not fully\nmeet this objective, as they are guided by pairwise scores that do not utilize\nthe entire functional and topological information across all networks. To\novercome this weakness, we propose FUSE, a multiple network aligner that\nutilizes all functional and topological information in all PPI networks. It\nworks in two steps. First, it computes novel similarity scores of proteins\nacross the PPI networks by fusing from all aligned networks both the protein\nwiring patterns and their sequence similarities. It does this by using\nNon-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF). When we apply NMTF on the five\nlargest and most complete PPI networks from BioGRID, we show that NMTF finds a\nlarger number of protein pairs across the PPI networks that are functionally\nconserved than can be found by using protein sequence similarities alone. This\ndemonstrates complementarity of protein sequence and their wiring patterns in\nthe PPI networks. In the second step, FUSE uses a novel maximum weight\nk-partite matching approximation algorithm to find an alignment between\nmultiple networks. We compare FUSE with the state of the art multiple network\naligners and show that it produces the largest number of functionally\nconsistent clusters that cover all aligned PPI networks.

To disclose the\nfunctional properties of genes, knowledge of network connections is essential.\nWe present a new method to reconstruct the Jacobian matrix of models for gene\nregulatory systems from equilibrium protein concentrations. In a recent paper\nwe defined propagation and feedback functions describing how genetic variation\nat one gene propagates to the other genes in the network and possibly also back\nto itself. Here we show how propagation and feedback functions provide\nrelations between equilibrium protein levels which are in principle observable,\nand Jacobi elements which are not directly observable. We establish exact\nformulae expressing the Jacobian in terms of derivatives of propagation and\nfeedback functions. Approximating these derivatives from perturbed and\nunperturbed protein levels, we derive formulae for estimating the Jacobian. We\napply the method to models of the Drosophila segment polarity network and\nrandomly generated gene networks. Genes could be perturbed in two ways: by\nmodifying mRNA degradation rates, or by allele knockout in diploid models.\nComparison with the true Jacobians shows that for noiseless data we obtain hit\nrates close to 100% in the former case and in the range 80-90% in the latter.\nOur method adds to the network interference toolbox and provides a sign\nestimate of the Jacobian from steady state data, and a value estimate of the\nJacobian if protein degradation rates are known. Also the approach identifies\nsome predicted connections as much more reliable than others, and could point\nto further experiments for resolving uncertainties in the less dependable\nJacobian elements.\n",

In our model, PPI networks evolve by two known biological mechanisms:\n(1) Gene duplication, which is followed by rapid diversification of duplicate\ninteractions. (2) Neofunctionalization, in which a mutation leads to a new\ninteraction with some other protein. Since many interactions are due to simple\nsurface compatibility, we hypothesize there is an increased likelihood of\ninteracting with other proteins in the target protein's neighborhood. We find\ngood agreement of the model on 10 different network properties compared to\nhigh-confidence experimental PPI networks in yeast, fruit flies, and humans.\nKey findings are: (1) PPI networks evolve modular structures, with no need to\ninvoke particular selection pressures. (2) Proteins in cells have on average\nabout 6 degrees of separation, similar to some social networks, such as\nhuman-communication and actor networks. (3) Unlike social networks, which have\na shrinking diameter (degree of maximum separation) over time, PPI networks are\npredicted to grow in diameter. (4) The model indicates that evolutionarily old\nproteins should have higher connectivities and be more centrally embedded in\ntheir networks.

Nevertheless, the majority of available protein-protein\ninteraction networks are context-less, i.e. without any reference to the\nspatial, temporal or physiological conditions in which the interactions may\noccur. In this work, we are proposing a protocol to infer the most likely\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network in human macrophages. Results: We\nintegrated the PPI dataset from the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer\n(APID) with different meta-data to infer a contextualized macrophage-specific\ninteractome using a combination of statistical methods. The obtained\ninteractome is enriched in experimentally verified interactions and in proteins\ninvolved in macrophage-related biological processes (i.e. immune response\nactivation, regulation of apoptosis). As a case study, we used the\ncontextualized interactome to highlight the cellular processes induced upon\nMycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: Our work confirms that\ncontextualizing interactomes improves the biological significance of\nbioinformatic analyses. More specifically, studying such inferred network\nrather than focusing at the gene expression level only, is informative on the\nprocesses involved in the host response.

In many cases, gradients of secreted signaling\nmolecules - morphogens - guide this process. The continuous positional\ninformation provided by the gradient is converted into discrete cell types by\nthe downstream transcriptional network that responds to the morphogen. A\nmechanism commonly used to implement a sharp transition between two adjacent\ncell fates is the genetic toggle switch, composed of cross-repressing\ntranscriptional determinants. Previous analyses emphasize the steady state\noutput of these mechanisms. Here, we explore the dynamics of the toggle switch\nand use exact numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions, the Chemical\nLangevin Equation, and Minimum Action Path theory to establish a framework for\nstudying the effect of gene expression noise on patterning time and boundary\nposition. This provides insight into the time scale, gene expression\ntrajectories and directionality of stochastic switching events between cell\nstates. Taking gene expression noise into account predicts that the final\nboundary position of a morphogen-induced toggle switch, although robust to\nchanges in the details of the noise, is distinct from that of the deterministic\nsystem. Moreover, stochastic switching introduces differences in patterning\ntime along the morphogen gradient that result in a patterning wave propagating\naway from the morphogen source. The velocity of this wave is influenced by\nnoise; the wave sharpens and slows as it advances and may never reach steady\nstate in a biologically relevant time. This could explain experimentally\nobserved dynamics of pattern formation. Together the analysis reveals the\nimportance of dynamical transients for understanding morphogen-driven\ntranscriptional networks and indicates that gene expression noise can\nqualitatively alter developmental patterning.\n",

We cannot use existing PSN\napproaches to test this, because: 1) They rely on naive measures of network\ntopology. 2) They are not robust to PSN size. They cannot integrate 3) multiple\nPSN measures or 4) PSN data with sequence data, although this could help\nbecause the different data types capture complementary biological knowledge. We\naddress these limitations by: 1) exploiting well-established graphlet measures\nvia a new network approach, 2) introducing normalized graphlet measures to\nremove the bias of PSN size, 3) allowing for integrating multiple PSN measures,\nand 4) using ordered graphlets to combine the complementary PSN data and\nsequence data. We compare both synthetic networks and real-world PSNs more\naccurately and faster than existing network, 3D contact, or sequence\napproaches. Our approach finds PSN patterns that may be biochemically\ninteresting.\n",

Following thermal stress,\nexpression levels of small heat shock protein 16.2 show a spatial patterning\nacross the 20 intestinal cells that reside along the length of the worm. Here,\nwe present a hypothesized mechanism that could lead to this patterned response\nand develop a mathematical model of this system to test our hypothesis. We\npropose that the patterned expression of heat shock protein is caused by a\ndiffusion-driven instability within the pseudocoelom, or fluid-filled cavity,\nthat borders the intestinal cells in C. elegans. This instability is due to the\ninteractions between two classes of insulin like peptides that serve\nantagonistic roles. We examine output from the developed model and compare it\nto experimental data on heat shock protein expression. Furthermore, we use the\nmodel to gain insight on possible biological parameters in the system.

It specifically binds to a membrane receptor (FSHR)\nexpressed in somatic cells of the gonads. The FSH/FSHR system presents many\npeculiarities compared to classical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). FSH is\na large naturally heterogeneous heterodimeric glycoprotein. The FSHR is\ncharacterized by a very large NH2-terminal extracellular domain, which binds\nthe FSH and participates to the activation/inactivation switch of the receptor.\nOnce activated, the FSHR couples to G{\\alpha}s and, in some instances, to other\nG{\\alpha} subunits. G protein-coupled receptor kinases and \\beta-arrestins are\nalso recruited to the FSHR and account for its desensitization, the control of\nits trafficking and its intracellular signalling. Of note, the FSHR\ninternalization and recycling are very fast and involve very early endosomes\ninstead of early endosomes. All the transduction mechanisms triggered upon FSH\nstimulation lead to the activation of a complex signalling network that\ncontrols gene expression by acting at multiple levels. The integration of these\nmechanisms leads to context-adapted responses from the target gonadal cells,\nbut also indirectly affects the fate of germ cells. Depending of the\nphysiological/developmental stage, FSH elicits proliferation, differentiation\nor apoptosis in order to maintain the homeostasis of the reproductive system.\nPharmacological tools targeting FSHR recently came to the fore and open\npromising prospects both for basic research and therapeutic applications.

The RFMIO and its variants encapsulate important properties that\nare relevant to modeling ribosome flow such as the possible evolution of\n\"traffic jams\" and non-homogeneous elongation rates along the mRNA molecule,\nand can also be used for studying additional intracellular processes such as\ntranscription, transport, and more. Here we consider networks of interconnected\nRFMIOs as a fundamental tool for modeling, analyzing and re-engineering the\ncomplex mechanisms of protein production. In these networks, the output of each\nRFMIO may be divided, using connection weights, between several inputs of other\nRFMIOs. We show that under quite general feedback connections the network has\ntwo important properties: (1) it admits a unique steady-state and every\ntrajectory converges to this steady-state, and (2) the problem of how to\ndetermine the connection weights so that the network steady-state output is\nmaximized is a convex optimization problem. These mathematical properties make\nthese networks highly suitable as models of various phenomena: property (1)\nmeans that the behavior is predictable and ordered, and property (2) means that\ndetermining the optimal weights is numerically tractable even for large-scale\nnetworks.

The aim of this\npaper is to present a new model of wine fermentation that accurately describes\nthe yeast dying component, the presence of glucose transporters, and the\nformation of aromas and acids. Therefore the new model could become a valuable\ntool to predict the taste of the wine and provide the starting point for an\nemerging control technology that aims at improving the quality of the wine by\nsteering a well-behaved fermentation process that is also energetically more\nefficient.

The current approach to uncovering the shared pathways between AD and\nT2DM involves association analysis; however, such analyses lack power to\ndiscover the mechanisms of the diseases. Methods: We develop novel statistical\nmethods to shift the current paradigm of genetic analysis from association\nanalysis to deep causal inference for uncovering the shared mechanisms between\nAD and T2DM, and develop pipelines to infer multilevel omics causal networks\nwhich lead to shifting the current paradigm of genetic analysis from genetic\nanalysis alone to integrated causal genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional and\nphenotypic data analysis. To discover common causal paths from genetic variants\nto AD and T2DM, we also develop algorithms that can automatically search the\ncausal paths from genetic variants to diseases and Results: The proposed\nmethods and algorithms are applied to ROSMAP dataset with 432 individuals who\nsimultaneously had genotype, RNA-seq, DNA methylation and some phenotypes. We\nconstruct multi-omics causal networks and identify 13 shared causal genes, 16\nshared causal pathways between AD and T2DM, and 754 gene expression and 101\ngene methylation nodes that were connected to both AD and T2DM in multi-omics\ncausal networks. Conclusions: The results of application of the proposed\npipelines for identifying causal paths to real data analysis of AD and T2DM\nprovided strong evidence to support the link between AD and T2DM and unraveled\ncausal mechanism to explain this link.\n",

This paper\nconsiders the problem of using biochemical circuits to distinguish persistent\nsignals from transient ones. We define a statistical detection problem over a\nreaction pathway consisting of three species: an inducer, a transcription\nfactor (TF) and a gene promoter, where the inducer can activate the TF and an\nactive TF can bind to the gene promoter. We model the pathway using the\nchemical master equation so the counts of bound promoters over time is a\nstochastic signal.

We use statistical detection theory to derive the\nsolution to this detection problem, which is to compute the log-likelihood\nratio of observing a persistent signal to a transient one. We then show, using\ntime-scale separation and other assumptions, that this log-likelihood ratio can\nbe approximately computed by using the continuous-time signals of the number of\nactive TF molecules and the number of bound promoters when the input is\npersistent.

        "summary": "  Epigenetic modifications of histones crucially affect the eukaryotic gene\nactivity, while the epigenetic histone state is largely determined by the\nbinding of specific factors such as the transcription factors (TFs) to DNA.\nHere, the way how the TFs and the histone state are dynamically correlated is\nnot obvious when the TF synthesis is regulated by the histone state. This type\nof feedback regulatory relations are ubiquitous in gene networks to determine\ncell fate in differentiation and other cell transformations. To gain insights\ninto such dynamical feedback regulations, we theoretically analyze a model of\nepigenetic gene switching by extending the Doi-Peliti operator formalism of\nreaction kinetics to the problem of coupled molecular processes. The spin-1 and\nspin-1/2 coherent state representations are introduced to describe stochastic\nreactions of histones and binding/unbinding of TF in a unified way, which\nprovides a concise view of the effects of timescale difference among these\nmolecular processes; even in the case that binding/unbinding of TF to/from DNA\nare adiabatically fast, the slow nonadiabatic histone dynamics give rise to a\ndistinct circular flow of the probability flux around basins in the landscape\nof the gene state distribution, which leads to hysteresis in gene switching. In\ncontrast to the general belief that the change in the amount of TF precedes the\nhistone state change, the flux drives histones to be modified prior to the\nchange in the amount of TF in the self-regulating circuits. The flux-landscape\nanalyses shed light on the nonlinear nonadiabatic mechanism of epigenetic cell\nfate decision making.\n",

In many applications\nit is often essential to test the ability of an individual node to control a\nspecific target subset of the network. In biological networks, this might\nprovide precious information on how single genes regulate the expression of\nspecific groups of molecules in the cell. Taking into account these\nconstraints, we propose an optimized heuristic based on the Kalman rank\ncondition to quantify the centrality of a node as the number of target nodes it\ncan control. By introducing a hierarchy among the nodes in the target set, and\nperforming a step-wise research, we ensure for sparse and directed networks the\nidentification of a controllable driver-target configuration in a significantly\nreduced space and time complexity. We show how the method works for simple\nnetwork configurations, then we use it to characterize the inflammatory\npathways in molecular gene networks associated with macrophage dysfunction in\npatients with multiple sclerosis. Results indicate that the targeted secreted\nmolecules can in general be controlled by a large number of driver nodes (51%)\ninvolved in different cell functions, i.e. sensing, signaling and\ntranscription. However, during the inflammatory response only a moderate\nfraction of all the possible driver-target pairs are significantly coactivated,\nas measured by gene expression data obtained from human blood samples. Notably,\nthey differ between multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls, and we\nfind that this is related to the presence of dysregulated genes along the\ncontrollable walks. Our method, that we name step-wise target controllability,\nrepresents a practical solution to identify controllable driver-target\nconfigurations in directed complex networks and test their relevance from a\nfunctional perspective.\n",

Though functions of IFFLs\nare well studied, most previous computational analysis of IFFLs used ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) models where retroactivity, the effect downstream\nbinding sites exert on the dynamics of an upstream transcription factor (TF),\nwas not considered. It remains an open question to understand the behavior of\nIFFLs in contexts with high levels of retroactivity, e.g., in cells\ntransformed/transfected with high-copy plasmids, or in eukaryotic cells where a\nTF binds to numerous high-affinity binding sites in addition to one or more\nfunctional target sites. Here we study the behavior of IFFLs by simulating and\ncomparing ODE models with different levels of retroactivity. We find that\nincreasing retroactivity in an IFFL can increase, decrease, or keep the\nnetwork's response time and pulse amplitude constant. This suggests that\nincreasing retroactivity, traditionally considered as an impediment to\ndesigning robust synthetic systems, could be exploited to improve the\nperformance of IFFLs. We compare the behaviors of IFFLs to negative\nautoregulatory loops, another sign-sensitive response-accelerating network\nmotif, and find that increasing retroactivity in a negative autoregulated\ncircuit can only slow the response. The inability of a negative autoregulatory\nloop to flexibly handle retroactivity may have contributed to its lower\nabundance in eukaryotic relative to bacterial regulatory networks, a sharp\ncontrast to the significant abundance of IFFLs in both cell types.\n",

The study\nof such machinery at the global scale has been challenged by the lack of data\nintegration. Here, we report three regulatory network models for C. glutamicum:\nstrong (3040 interactions) constructed solely with regulations previously\nsupported by directed experiments; all evidence (4665 interactions) containing\nthe strong network, regulations previously supported by non-directed\nexperiments, and protein-protein interactions with a direct effect on gene\ntranscription; and sRNA (5222 interactions) containing the all evidence network\nand sRNA-mediated regulations. Compared to the previous version (2018), the\nstrong and all evidence networks increased by 75 and 1225 interactions,\nrespectively. We analyzed the system-level components of the three networks to\nidentify how they differ and compared their structures against those for the\nnetworks of more than 40 species. The inclusion of the sRNAs regulations\nchanged the proportions of the system-level components and increased the number\nof modules but decreased their size. The C. glutamicum regulatory structure\ncontrasted with other bacterial regulatory networks. Finally, we used the\nstrong networks of three model organisms to provide insights and future\ndirections of the C. glutamicum regulatory network characterization.\n",

The classification principles underlying these ontologies are guided\nby the analysis of observable pathological similarities between disorders,\noften based on anatomical or histological principles. Although, thanks to\nrecent advances in molecular biology, disease ontologies are slowly changing to\nintegrate the etiological and genetic origins of diseases, nosology still\nreflects this \"reductionist\" perspective. Proximity relationships of disease\nmodules (hereafter DMs) in the human interactome network are now increasingly\nused in diagnostics, to identify pathobiologically similar diseases and to\nsupport drug repurposing and discovery. On the other hand, similarity relations\ninduced from structural proximity of DMs also have several limitations, such as\nincomplete knowledge of disease-gene relationships and reliability of clinical\ntrials to assess their validity. The purpose of the study described in this\npaper is to shed more light on disease similarities by analyzing the\nrelationship between categorical proximity of diseases in human-curated\nontologies and structural proximity of the related DM in the interactome.\nMethod: We propose a methodology (and related algorithms) to automatically\ninduce a hierarchical structure from proximity relations between DMs, and to\ncompare this structure with a human-curated disease taxonomy. Results: We\ndemonstrate that the proposed methodology allows to systematically analyze\ncommonalities and differences among structural and categorical similarity of\nhuman diseases, help refine and extend human disease classification systems,\nand identify promising network areas where new disease-gene interactions can be\ndiscovered.\n",

We further define the properties that outline such\nconsistency and show that several of the Boolean functions under study violate\nthem, questioning their biological plausibility and subsequent use. We also\nillustrate that regulatory functions can have major differences with regard to\ntheir asymptotic output behavior, with some of them being biased towards\nspecific Boolean outcomes when others are dependent on the ratio between\nactivating and inhibitory regulators.\n  Application results show that in a specific signaling cancer network, the\nfunction bias can be used to guide the choice of logical operators for a model\nthat matches data observations.

In addition, input intensity play major roles in the\nphenotypes of FFLs: At weak input intensity, FFL exhibit monomodality, but\nstrong input intensity may result in up to 6 stable phenotypes.

In the induced state of the\nlac-pathway, the genes comprising the lac-operon are transcribed, leading to\nthe production of proteins which import and metabolize lactose. In the\nuninduced state, a stable repressor-DNA loop frequently blocks the\ntranscription of the lac-genes. Transitions from one phenotypic state to the\nother are driven by fluctuations, which arise from the random timing of the\nbinding of ligands and proteins. This stochasticity affects transcription and\ntranslation, and ultimately molecular copy numbers. Our aim is to understand\nthe transition from the induced to the uninduced state of the lac-operon. We\nuse a detailed computational model to show that repressor-operator\nbinding/unbinding, fluctuations in the total number of repressors, and\ninducer-repressor binding/unbinding all play a role in this transition. Based\non the timescales on which these processes operate, we construct a minimal\nmodel of the transition to the uninduced state and compare the results with\nsimulations and experimental observations. The induced state turns out to be\nvery stable, with a transition rate to the uninduced state lower than $2 \\times\n10^{-9}$ per minute. In contrast to the transition to the induced state, the\ntransition to the uninduced state is well described in terms of a 2D diffusive\nsystem crossing a barrier, with the diffusion rates emerging from a model of\nrepressor unbinding.\n",

At a nanoscale, the Arp2/3 complex alters the topology of\nactomyosin by nucleating a daughter filament at an angle to a mother filament.\nAt a subcellular scale, they orchestrate the formation of branched actomyosin\nnetwork. Using a coarse-grained approach, we sought to understand how an\nactomyosin network temporally and spatially reorganizes itself by varying the\nconcentration of the Arp2/3 complexes. Driven by the motor dynamics, the\nnetwork stalls at a high concentration of Arp2/3 and contracts at a low Arp2/3\nconcentration. At an intermediate Arp2/3 concentration, however, the actomyosin\nnetwork is formed by loosely connected clusters that may collapse suddenly when\ndriven by motors. This physical phenomenon is called an \"avalanche\" largely due\nto the marginal instability inherent from the morphology of a branched\nactomyosin network when the Arp2/3 complex is present. While embracing the data\nscience approaches, we unveiled the higher-order patterns in the branched\nactomyosin networks and discovered a sudden change in the \"social\" network\ntopology of the actomyosin. This is a new type of avalanches in addition to the\ntwo types of avalanches associated with a sudden change in the size or the\nshape of the whole actomyosin network as shown in the previous investigation.\nOur new finding promotes the importance of using network theory and machine\nlearning models to forecast avalanches in actomyosin networks.

These\nfindings suggests that PIN in real biological setting contribute to the overall\nstochastic noise that is close to Poisson. Our results also show a correlation\nbetween stochastic noise, network size and network connectivity: for monomers,\nthe Fano factors tend towards 1 from above, while the Fano factors for dimers\ntend towards 1 from below. For monomers, this tendency is amplified with\nincreased network connectivity.\n",

Over the last decade, RCKIs have\nbeen reported to target different kinases, including atypical kinases.\nCurrently, three RCKIs are undergoing clinical trials to treat specific\ndiseases, for example, Pemphigus, an autoimmune disorder. In this perspective,\nfirst, RCKIs are systematically summarized, including characteristics of\nelectrophilic groups, chemical scaffolds, nucleophilic residues, and binding\nmodes. Second, we provide insights into privileged electrophiles, the\ndistribution of nucleophiles and hence effective design strategies for RCKIs.\nFinally, we provide a brief perspective on future design strategies for RCKIs,\nincluding those that target proteins other than kinases.\n",

To model the network evolution, we postulate vertex duplication\nand edge deletion as evolutionary operations on graphs. Using the novel concept\nof an ancestrally distinguished subgraph, we show how features of present-day\nnetworks require certain features of their ancestors. In particular,\nancestrally distinguished subgraphs cannot be introduced by vertex duplication.\nAdditionally, if vertex duplication and edge deletion are the only evolutionary\nmechanisms, then a graph's ancestrally distinguished subgraphs must be\ncontained in all of the graph's ancestors.

This paper describes a configuration space model of\nimmune function, where directed chemical potentials of the system constitute a\nspace of interactions. In the physical sense, the humoral adaptive immune\nsystem adjusts the chemical potential of all available antigenic molecules by\ntuning the chemical potential and organizing the network hierarchy of its\nsensor-effector molecules, antibodies. The coupling of sensors and effectors\nallows the system to adjust the thermodynamic activity of antigens and\nantibodies, while network organization helps minimize chemical potentials and\nmaximize diversity. Mathematically the system couples the variance of Gaussian\ndistributed interaction energies in its interaction space to the exponentially\ndistributed chemical potentials of its effector molecules to maintain its\nstationary state. This process creates a scale-free network in interaction\nspace, where absolute thermodynamic activity corresponds to node degree. In the\nthermodynamic interpretation, the system is an ensemble carrying out {mu}N\nwork, adjusting chemical potentials according to the changes in the chemical\npotentials of the surroundings. The validity of the model is supported by\nidentifying an interaction flexibility index, the corresponding variables in\nthermodynamics and network science, and by confirming its applicability to the\nhumoral immune system. Overall, this statistical thermodynamics model of\nadaptive immunity describes how adaptive biological self-organization arises\nfrom the maintenance of a scale-free, directed interaction network with fractal\ntopology.\n",

While this software is widely used, it works as a\nstandalone application and until now it was not possible for users to interact\nwith its models through the web. We built ShinyCOPASI, a web-based application\nthat allows COPASI models to be explored through a web browser. ShinyCOPASI was\nwritten in R with the CoRC package, which provides a high-level R API for\nCOPASI, and the Shiny package to expose it as a web application. The web view\nprovided by ShinyCOPASI follows a similar interface to the standalone COPASI\nand allows users to explore the details of a model, as well as running a subset\nof the tasks available in COPASI from within a browser. A generic version\nallows users to load model files from their computer, while another one\npre-loads a specific model from the server and may be useful to provide web\naccess to published models. The application is available at:\nhttp://shiny.copasi.org/; and the source code is at:\nhttps://github.com/copasi/shinyCOPASI.\n",

The\ninherent nonlinearity in this regulatory process together with the bursty\nproduction of messenger RNA (mRNA), sRNA and protein make the exact solution\nfor this stochastic process intractable. This is particularly the case when\nquantifying the protein noise level, which has great impact on multiple\ncellular processes. Here we propose an approximate yet reasonably accurate\nsolution for the gene expression noise with infrequent burst and strong\nregulation by sRNAs. This analytical solution allows us to better analyze the\nnoise and stochastic deviation of protein level. We find that the regulation\namplifies the noise, reduces the protein level. The stochasticity in the\nregulation generates more proteins than what if the stochasticity is removed\nfrom the system. The sRNA level is most important to the relationship between\nthe noise and stochastic deviation. The results provide analytical tools for\nmore general studies of gene expression and strengthen our quantitative\nunderstandings of post-transcriptional regulation in controlling gene\nexpression processes.\n",

The first set of these reactions, which happen near a gene promoter,\nare considered to be the most important in the context of stochastic noise. The\nmost common models of transcription are primarily concerned with the effect of\nactivators/repressors on the overall transcription rate and approximate the\nbasal transcription processes as a one step event. According to such effective\nmodels, the Fano factor of mRNA copy distributions is always greater than\n(super-Poissonian) or equal to 1 (Poissonian), and the only way to go below\nthis limit (sub-Poissonian) is via a negative feedback. It is partly due to\nthis limit that the first stage of transcription is held responsible for most\nof the stochastic noise in mRNA copy numbers. However, by considering all major\nreactions that build and drive the basal transcription machinery, from the\nfirst protein that binds a promoter to the entrance of the transcription\ncomplex (TC) into productive elongation, it is shown that the first two stages\nof transcription, namely the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation and the\npromoter proximal pausing (PPP), is a highly punctual process. In other words,\nthe time between the first and the last step of this process is narrowly\ndistributed, which gives rise to sub-Poissonian distributions for the number of\nTCs that have entered productive elongation. In fact, having simulated the PIC\nformation and the PPP via the Gillespie algorithm using 2000 distinct parameter\nsets and 4 different reaction network topologies, it is shown that only 4.4%\ngive rise to a Fano factor that is > 1 with the upper bound of 1.7, while for\n31% of cases the Fano factor is below 0.5, with 0.19 as the lower bound.

Based on the existing\nmathematical models, we develop an age-dependent feedback control model to\nsimulate the interaction. The model consists of three subsystems: cytosolic\ncalcium dynamics, ROS generation from the respiratory chain in mitochondria,\nand mitochondrial energy metabolism. In the model, we hypothesized that ROS\ninduces calcium release from the yeast endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus,\nand vacuoles, and that ROS damages calmodulin and calcineurin by oxidizing\nthem. The dependence of calcium uptake by Vcx1p on ATP is incorporated into the\nmodel. The model can approximately reproduce the log phase calcium dynamics.\nThe simulated interaction between the cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial ROS\nshows that an increase in calcium results in a decrease in ROS initially (in\nlog phase), but the increase-decrease relation is changed to an\nincrease-increase relation when the cell is getting old. This could accord with\nthe experimental observation that calcium diminishes ROS from complexes I and\nIII of the respiratory chain under normal conditions, but enhances ROS when the\ncomplex formations are inhibited. The model predicts that the subsystem of the\ncalcium regulators Pmc1p, Pmr1p, and Vex1p is stable, controllable, and\nobservable. These structural properties of the dynamical system could\nmathematically confirm that cells have evolved delicate feedback control\nmechanisms to maintain their calcium homeostasis.\n",

In some circumstances, cells need to make decisions\naccurately and quickly, therefore it has been suggested the SPRT may be used to\nunderstand the speed-accuracy tradeoff in cellular decision making. It is\ngenerally thought that in order for cells to make use of the SPRT, it is\nnecessary to find biochemical circuits that can compute the log-likelihood\nratio needed for the SPRT. However, this paper takes a different approach. We\nrecognise that the high-level behaviour of the SPRT is defined by its positive\ndetection or hit rate, and the computation of the log-likelihood ratio is just\none way to realise this behaviour. In this paper, we will present a method\nwhich uses a transcription-based detector to emulate the hit rate of the SPRT\nwithout computing the exact log-likelihood ratio. We consider the problem of\nusing a promoter with multiple binding sites to accurately and quickly detect\nwhether the concentration of a transcription factor is above a target level. We\nshow that it is possible to find binding and unbinding rates of the\ntranscription factor to the promoter's binding sites so that the probability\nthat the amount of mRNA produced will be higher than a threshold is\napproximately equal to the hit rate of the SPRT detector. Moreover, we show\nthat the average time that this transcription-based detector needs to make a\npositive detection is less than or equal to that of the SPRT for a wide range\nof concentrations. We remark that the last statement does not contradict Wald's\noptimality result because our transcription-based detector uses an open-ended\ntest.\n",

Their applicability in this variety of fields depends not only on\ntheir biochemical function but also on their physicochemical properties. In the\npresent work, we describe how the coincidence methodology can be employed to\nconstruct similarity networks of seventy well-studied enzymes of the Glycoside\nHydrolase Family 13 and to identify communities of physicochemically related\nenzymes. More specifically, each of the selected enzymes is mapped into a\nnetwork node, while the links between pairs of enzymes are determined by the\ncoincidence similarity between selected physicochemical features of interest.\nThe obtained networks have modularity and number of isolated nodes optimized\nrespectively to two parameters involved in the coincidence methodology,\nresulting in highly modular networks. In order to investigate the effect of the\nconsidered physicochemical features on the enzymes relationships, the\ncoincidence-based method also is applied to create a meta-network, in which the\nenzymes similarity networks obtained by the combination of every possible\nfeature becomes nodes of a feature combination network, and the coincidence\nsimilarity between those networks defines the respective links. The obtained\nfeature combination network systematically and comprehensively indicates the\nimpact of the selected physicochemical features on enzyme similarity. Several\ninteresting results are reported and discussed, including the identification of\nsubgroups of enzymes with similar physicochemical features within catalytical\nclasses, providing important information for the selection and design of\nenzymes for targeted biotechnological applications.\n",

        "summary": "  Identification of human genes involved in the aging process is critical due\nto the incidence of many diseases with age. A state-of-the-art approach for\nthis purpose infers a weighted dynamic aging-specific subnetwork by mapping\ngene expression (GE) levels at different ages onto the protein-protein\ninteraction network (PPIN). Then, it analyzes this subnetwork in a supervised\nmanner by training a predictive model to learn how network topologies of known\naging- vs. non-aging-related genes change across ages. Finally, it uses the\ntrained model to predict novel aging-related genes. However, the best current\nsubnetwork resulting from this approach still yields suboptimal prediction\naccuracy. This could be because it was inferred using outdated GE and PPIN\ndata. Here, we evaluate whether analyzing a weighted dynamic aging-specific\nsubnetwork inferred from newer GE and PPIN data improves prediction accuracy\nupon analyzing the best current subnetwork inferred from outdated data.\nUnexpectedly, we find that not to be the case. To understand this, we perform\naging-related pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses. We find\nthat the suboptimal prediction accuracy, regardless of which GE or PPIN data is\nused, may be caused by the current knowledge about which genes are\naging-related being incomplete, or by the current methods for inferring or\nanalyzing an aging-specific subnetwork being unable to capture all of the\naging-related knowledge. These findings can potentially guide future directions\ntowards improving supervised prediction of aging-related genes via -omics data\nintegration.\n",

While clinical data have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of selected TCM-based treatments, the mechanistic root of how TCM\nherbs treat diseases remains largely unknown. More importantly, current\napproaches focus on single herbs or prescriptions, missing the high-level\ngeneral principles of TCM. To uncover the mechanistic nature of TCM on a system\nlevel, in this work we establish a generic network medicine framework for TCM\nfrom the human protein interactome. Applying our framework reveals a network\npattern between symptoms (diseases) and herbs in TCM. We first observe that\ngenes associated with a symptom are not distributed randomly in the\ninteractome, but cluster into localized modules; furthermore, a short network\ndistance between two symptom modules is indicative of the symptoms'\nco-occurrence and similarity. Next, we show that the network proximity of a\nherb's targets to a symptom module is predictive of the herb's effectiveness in\ntreating the symptom. We validate our framework with real-world hospital\npatient data by showing that (1) shorter network distance between symptoms of\ninpatients correlates with higher relative risk (co-occurrence), and (2)\nherb-symptom network proximity is indicative of patients' symptom recovery rate\nafter herbal treatment. Finally, we identified novel herb-symptom pairs in\nwhich the herb's effectiveness in treating the symptom is predicted by network\nand confirmed in hospital data, but previously unknown to the TCM community.\nThese predictions highlight our framework's potential in creating herb\ndiscovery or repurposing opportunities. In conclusion, network medicine offers\na powerful novel platform to understand the mechanism of traditional medicine\nand to predict novel herbal treatment against diseases.\n",

Although DNA computing has been\nexploited to solve various intractable computational problems, such as the\nHamiltonian path problem, SAT problem, and graph coloring problem, there has\nbeen little discussion of designing universal DNA computing-based models, which\ncan solve a class of problems. In this paper, by leveraging the dynamic and\nenzyme-free properties of DNA strand displacement, we propose a universal model\nnamed DCMSubset for solving subset problems in graph theory. The model aims to\nfind a minimum (or maximum) set satisfying given constraints. For each element\nx involved in a given problem, DCMSubset uses an exclusive single-stranded DNA\nmolecule to model x as well as a specific DNA complex to model the relationship\nbetween x and other elements. Based on the proposed model, we conducted\nsimulation and biochemical experiments on three kinds of subset problems, a\nminimum dominating set, maximum independent set, and minimum vertex cover. We\nobserved that DCMSubset can also be used to solve the graph coloring problem.\nMoreover, we extended DCMSubset to a model for solving the SAT problem.

By analyzing both Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of\nGenes (KEGG), for screening DEGs has provided information about their\nbiological function. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) of DEGs were analyzed\nusing the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database (STRING)\nand visualized by Cytoscape.

The Gene Ontology (GO)\nindicated that extracellular matrix organization, extracellular structure\norganization, collagen catabolic process and also the uDEGs are enriched in\nfocal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction by KEGG\nanalysis. The top ten hub genes were identified from the PPI network: COL1A1,\nCOL3A1, COL1A2, FN1, COL5A2, ITGA3, FBN1, MET, COL6A3, and BGN. These 10 hub\ngenes are highly upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, according to\nGEPIA research. The UALCAN prognostic analysis of the 10 hub genes revealed\nthat two of the elevated genes, ITGA3 and MET, significantly shortened PDAC\npatient survival time. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is linked to Focal\nadhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction,\naccording to Module analysis from the PPI network.\n  Conclusion: This investigation identified hub genes and important signal\npathways, which adds to our knowledge of molecular mechanisms and could be\nexploited as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for Pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinoma.\n",

Saffron flowers are harvested\nmanually and used as spice, dye, or medicinal applications. The natural\npropagation rate of most geophytes including saffron is relatively low. An in\nvitro multiplication technique like micropropagation has been used for the\npropagation of saffron.

The present study was conducted at Plant molecular and physiology\nLab, Alzahra University, Tehran, Iran during 2011-2013. Stigma-like structures\n(SLSs) on calli were collected from immature perianth explants from floral buds\nof corms that were collected from Ghaen city, and compared to (Torbat-e\nHaidariye, Mardabad, and Shahroud cities) for investigating the impact of\ndifferent soil EC on CsZCD expression. The results indicated that the CsZCD\ngene was highly expressed in fully developed red SLSs in perianth of cultured\nsamples of Shahroud with the highest salinity. In this research, a close\nrelationship between soil EC and second metabolites regulation is studied.\nOverall, these results will pave the way for understanding the molecular basis\nof apocarotenoid biosynthesis and other aspects of stigma development in C.\nsativus.\n",

One promising approach to this problem\nis to use a multilayer network analysis framework and perform multilayer\ncommunity detection. Communities in gene co-expression networks reveal groups\nof genes similarly expressed across individuals, potentially involved in\nrelated biological processes responding to specific environmental stimuli or\nsharing common regulatory variations. We construct a multilayer network in\nwhich each of the four layers is an exocrine gland tissue-specific gene\nco-expression network. We develop methods for multilayer community detection\nwith correlation matrix input and an appropriate null model. Our correlation\nmatrix input method identifies five groups of genes that are similarly\nco-expressed in multiple tissues (a community that spans multiple layers, which\nwe call a generalist community) and two groups of genes that are co-expressed\nin just one tissue (a community that lies primarily within just one layer,\nwhich we call a specialist community). We further found gene co-expression\ncommunities where the genes physically cluster across the genome significantly\nmore than expected by chance (on chromosomes 1 and 11). This clustering hints\nat underlying regulatory elements determining similar expression patterns\nacross individuals and cell types. We suggest that KRTAP3-1, KRTAP3-3, and\nKRTAP3-5 share regulatory elements in skin and pancreas.

Apart from the\nfavorable effects of some antiviral drugs following tumor resection on the\nsurvival of HCC patients, the use of these agents is essential lifelong. Thus,\ndesigning the target-oriented therapeutic strategies to increase life\nexpectancy in HCC patients would be very important. The present study aimed to\nidentify downregulated hub genes and enriched pathways in HB-related HCC using\na systems biology-based approach. Microarray data of GSE121248 were downloaded\nfrom gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes\n(DEGs) with the cut-off criteria of adjusted p < 0.05 and Log Fold-change (FC)\n< -1.5 were selected. Then, the genes with the highest centrality were\ndetected. Finally, the prognostic values of the hub genes were assessed. Six\nunder-expressed hub genes with the highest interaction degree, Betweenness and\nEigenvector centrality were including IGF-1, PTGS2, PLG, HGF, ESR-1 and CYP2B6.\nAmong genes with high centrality, several genes including CYP2C9, ESR-1, CXCL2,\nCYP2C8, IGF-1, CYP3A4, CYP2E1, CERPINE-1 and PXR were prognostic in HCC. The\nimportant repressed pathways were including metabolic pathways and PI3K-Akt and\nchemokine signaling pathways. The under-expression of several genes implicated\nin metabolism, differentiation and chemotaxis might be a hallmark of the\nprogression of HCC that can be considered as diagnostic and therapeutic\ntargets.\n",

Fortunately,\nreaction network analysis allows us to extract properties of dynamical systems\nwithout depending on their model parameter values. This study focuses on the\ncomparison of insulin signaling in healthy state (INSMS or INSulin Metabolic\nSignaling) and in type 2 diabetes (INRES or INsulin RESistance) using reaction\nnetwork analysis. The analysis uses network decomposition to identify the\ndifferent subsystems involved in insulin signaling (e.g., insulin receptor\nbinding and recycling, GLUT4 translocation, and ERK signaling pathway, among\nothers). Furthermore, results show that INSMS and INRES are similar with\nrespect to some network, structo-kinetic, and kinetic properties. Their\ndifferences, however, provide insights into what happens when insulin\nresistance occurs. First, the variation in the number of species involved in\nINSMS and INRES suggests that when irregularities occur in the insulin\nsignaling pathway, other complexes (and, hence, other processes) get involved,\ncharacterizing insulin resistance. Second, the loss of concordance exhibited by\nINRES suggests less restrictive interplay between the species involved in\ninsulin signaling, leading to unusual activities in the signaling cascade.\nLastly, GLUT4 losing its absolute concentration robustness in INRES may signify\nthat the transporter has lost its reliability in shuttling glucose to the cell,\ninhibiting efficient cellular energy production. This study also suggests\npossible applications of the equilibria parametrization and network\ndecomposition, resulting from the analysis, to potentially establish absolute\nconcentration robustness in a species.\n",

Although changes in expression extend\nwell beyond the genetically manipulated gene, nearly all expression\nalternations approximate the canonical combinations of activating levels in\nwild-type, sometimes necessitating pattern shifts. Expression levels that\ndiverge from the wild-type repertoire still drive locus activation. Specific\nstripes in the homozygous mutants show partial penetrance, justifying their\nrenown variable phenotypes.

Our results suggest a correction capacity of the gap gene\nnetwork and set constraints on the activity of multi-enhancer gene loci.\n",

In this study, we used the Arabidopsis\nSTTM165/166 mutant, which exhibits enhanced temperature tolerance, to examine\nthis relationship. Surface recording techniques were utilized to compare the\ngeneration ratio and duration characteristics of electrical signals in the\nSTTM165/166 mutant and wild type (WT). Patch-clamp recording was employed to\nassess ion channel currents, specifically those of calcium ions. The current\nintensity of the mutant was found to be lower than that of the WT. As calcium\nions are involved in the generation of plant electrical signals, we\nhypothesized that the reduced calcium channel activity in the mutant increased\nits electrical signal threshold. RNA-Seq analysis revealed differential\nexpression of AHA genes in the STTM165/166 mutant, which may contribute to the\nprolonged depolarization phenotype. Gene Ontology enrichment of differentially\nexpressed genes (DEGs) identified associations between these DEGs and various\nstresses, including temperature, salt, and those related to the jasmonic acid\nand abscisic acid pathways. These findings provide experimental evidence for\nthe use of plant electrical signals in characterizing stress tolerance and\nexplore potential ion mechanisms through patch-clamp recording and DEG Gene\nOntology analysis.

Here\nwe present numerical results to show that the polarized pattern of an\nantagonistic 2-node network collapses into a homogeneous state when subjected\nto single-sided self-regulation, single-sided additional regulation, or unequal\nsystem parameters. However, polarity can be restored through a combination of\ntwo modifications that have opposing effects. Additionally, spatially\ninhomogeneous parameters favoring respective domains stabilize their interface\nat designated locations. To connect our findings to cell polarity studies of\nthe nematode Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, we reconstituted a 5-node network\nwhere a 4-node circuit with full mutual inhibitions between anterior and\nposterior is modified by a mutual activation in the anterior and an additional\nmutual inhibition between the anterior and the posterior. Once again, a generic\nset of kinetic parameters moves the interface towards either the anterior or\nposterior end, yet a polarized pattern can be stabilized through spatial tuning\nof one or more parameters coupled to intracellular or extracellular cues. A\nuser-friendly software, PolarSim, is introduced to facilitate the exploration\nof networks with alternative node numbers, parameter values, and regulatory\npathways.\n",

Furthermore, it plays a critical role in\nthe regulation of RNA degradation by primarily recruiting the YTHDF2 reader\nprotein. However, the selective regulation of mRNA decay of the m6A-methylated\nmRNA through YTHDF2 binding is poorly understood. To improve our understanding,\nwe developed m6A-BERT-Deg, a BERT model adapted for predicting YTHDF2-mediated\ndegradation of m6A-methylated mRNAs. We meticulously assembled a high-quality\ntraining dataset by integrating multiple data sources for the HeLa cell line.\nTo overcome the limitation of small training samples, we employed a\npre-training-fine-tuning strategy by first performing a self-supervised\npre-training of the model on 427,760 unlabeled m6A site sequences. The test\nresults demonstrated the importance of this pre-training strategy in enabling\nm6A-BERT-Deg to outperform other benchmark models. We further conducted a\ncomprehensive model interpretation and revealed a surprising finding that the\npresence of co-factors in proximity to m6A sites may disrupt YTHDF2-mediated\nmRNA degradation, subsequently enhancing mRNA stability. We also extended our\nanalyses to the HEK293 cell line, shedding light on the context-dependent\nYTHDF2-mediated mRNA degradation.\n",

This strategy is pervasive in biology, but it\nremains unclear what determines the accuracy of such measurements. Using a\ngeneralized version of the previously established sampling framework, we\ninvestigate how resource limitations and the statistics of the input signal set\nthe optimal design of a well-characterized network that measures temporal\nconcentration changes: the Escherichia coli chemotaxis network. Our results\nshow how an optimal adaptation time arises from the trade-off between the\nsampling error, caused by the stochastic nature of the network, and the\ndynamical error, caused by uninformative fluctuations in the input. A larger\nresource availability reduces the sampling error, which allows for a smaller\nadaptation time, thereby simultaneously decreasing the dynamical error.\nSimilarly, we find that the optimal adaptation time scales inversely with the\ngradient steepness, because steeper gradients lift the signal above the noise\nand reduce the sampling error.

If the walker pauses at each node for a\nperiod of time drawn from a continuous distribution, the FPT will be a\ncontinuous variable; if the pauses last exactly one unit of time, the FPT will\nbe discrete and equal to the number of hops.

        "summary": "  Understanding the insulin signaling cascade provides insights on the\nunderlying mechanisms of biological phenomena such as insulin resistance,\ndiabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. For this reason, previous studies\nutilized chemical reaction network theory to perform comparative analyses of\nreaction networks of insulin signaling in healthy (INSMS: INSulin Metabolic\nSignaling) and diabetic cells (INRES: INsulin RESistance). This study extends\nthese analyses using various methods which give further insights regarding\ninsulin signaling. Using embedded networks, we discuss evidence of the presence\nof a structural \"bifurcation\" in the signaling process between INSMS and INRES.\nConcordance profiles of INSMS and INRES show that both have a high propensity\nto remain monostationary. Moreover, the concordance properties allow us to\npresent heuristic evidence that INRES has a higher level of stability beyond\nits monostationarity. Finally, we discuss a new way of analyzing reaction\nnetworks through network translation. This method gives rise to three new\ninsights: (i) each stoichiometric class of INSMS and INRES contains a unique\npositive equilibrium; (ii) any positive equilibrium of INSMS is exponentially\nstable and is a global attractor in its stoichiometric class; and (iii) any\npositive equilibrium of INRES is locally asymptotically stable. These results\nopen up opportunities for collaboration with experimental biologists to\nunderstand insulin signaling better.\n",

        "summary": "  Complex systems can be advantageously modeled by formal reaction systems\n(RS), a.k.a. chemical reaction networks in chemistry. Reaction-based models can\nindeed be interpreted in a hierarchy of semantics, depending on the question at\nhand, most notably by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Continuous Time\nMarkov Chains (CTMCs), discrete Petri nets and asynchronous Boolean transition\nsystems. The last three semantics can be easily related in the framework of\nabstract interpretation. The first two are classically related by Kurtz's limit\ntheorem which states that if reactions are density-dependent families, then, as\nthe volume goes to infinity, the mean reactant concentrations of the CTMC tends\ntowards the solution of the ODE. In the more realistic context of bounded\nvolumes, it is easy to show, by moment closure, that the restriction to\nreactions with at most one reactant ensures similarly that the mean of the CTMC\ntrajectories is equal to the solution of the ODE at all time points. In this\npaper, we generalize that result in presence of polyreactant reactions, by\nintroducing the Stoichiometric Influence and Modification Graph (SIMG) of an\nRS, and by showing that the equality between the two interpretations holds for\nthe variables that belong to distinct SIMG ancestors of polyreactant reactions.\nWe illustrate this approach with several examples. Evaluation on BioModels\nreveals that the condition for all variables is satisfied on models with no\npolymolecular reaction only. However, our theorem can be applied selectively to\ncertain variables of the model to provide insights into their behaviour within\nmore complex systems. Interestingly, we also show that the equality holds for a\nbasic oscillatory RS implementing the sine and cosine functions of time.\n",

Their mathematics does not describe just chemical reactions but many\nother areas of the life sciences such as ecology, epidemiology, and population\ndynamics. We say a CRN is at a steady state when the concentration (or number)\nof species do not vary anymore. Some CRNs do not attain a steady state while\nsome others may have more than one possible steady state. The CRNs in the later\ngroup are called multistationary. Multistationarity is an important property,\ne.g. switch-like behaviour in cells needs multistationarity to occur. Existing\nalgorithms to detect whether a CRN is multistationary or not are either\nextremely expensive or restricted in the type of CRNs they can be used on,\nmotivating a new machine learning approach.\n  We address the problem of representing variable-length CRN data to machine\nlearning models by developing a new graph representation of CRNs for use with\ngraph learning algorithms. We contribute a large dataset of labelled fully open\nCRNs whose production necessitated the development of new CRN theory. Then we\npresent experimental results on the training and testing of a graph attention\nnetwork model on this dataset, showing excellent levels of performance.

Notch ligands of the Delta family are key\ncomponents of this collective rhythm, but it is unclear how different Delta\nligands with distinct properties contribute to relaying information among\ncells. Motivated by the zebrafish segmentation clock, in this work we propose a\ntheory describing interactions between biochemical oscillators, where Notch\nreceptor is bound by both oscillatory and nonoscillatory Delta ligands. Based\non previous in vitro binding studies, we first consider Notch activation by\nDelta dimers. This hypothesis is consistent with experimental observations in\nconditions of perturbed Notch signaling. Then we test an alternative hypothesis\nwhere Delta monomers directly bind and activate Notch, and show that this\nsecond model can also describe the experimental observations. We show that\nthese two hypotheses assign different roles for a non-oscillatory ligand, as a\nbinding partner or as a baseline signal.

To solve this problem, we\npropose a novel target identification model NP-TCMtarget to explore the TCM\ntarget path by combining the overall chemical and biological profiles. First,\nNP-TCMtarget infers TCM effect targets by calculating associations between\ndrug/disease inducible gene expression profiles and specific gene signatures\nfor 8,233 targets. Then, NP-TCMtarget utilizes a constructed binary\nclassification model to predict binding targets of herbal ingredients. Finally,\nwe can distinguish TCM direct and indirect targets by comparing the effect\ntargets and binding targets to establish the action pathways of herbal\ncomponents-direct targets-indirect targets by mapping TCM targets in the\nbiological molecular network.

To study their functional role in the regulation of\nspecific receptor systems, current research relies mainly on genetic tools, as\nfew pharmacological options are available. To address this issue, we designed\nand synthesised a novel lipidated phosphomimetic peptide inhibitor targeting\n$\\beta$-arrestins, called ARIP, which was developed based on the C-terminal\ntail (A343-S371) of the vasopressin V2 receptor. As the V2R sequence has been\nshown to bind $\\beta$-arrestins with high affinity and stability, we added an\nN-terminal palmitate residue to allow membrane tethering and subsequent cell\nentry. Here, using BRET2-based biosensors, we demonstrated the ability of ARIP\nto inhibit agonist-induced $\\beta$-arrestin recruitment on a series of 7TMRs\nbelonging to class A (low stable associations with arrestins) or class B (high\nstability), with efficiencies that dependent on receptor type. In addition, we\nshowed that ARIP was unable to recruit $\\beta$-arrestins to the cell membrane\nby itself, and that it did not interfere with canonical G protein signalling.\nMolecular modelling studies also revealed that ARIP binds $\\beta$-arrestins in\nthe same way as V2Rpp, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the V2R\nC-terminal domain, and that replacing the p-Ser and p-Thr residues of V2Rpp\nwith Glu residues does not alter the inhibitory activity of ARIP on\n$\\beta$-arrestin recruitment. Importantly, ARIP exerted an opioid-sparing\neffect in vivo, as intrathecal injection of ARIP potentiated the analgesic\neffect of morphine in the tail-flick nociceptive model, a behavioural response\nconsistent with $\\beta$-arrestin genetic inhibition. ARIP therefore represents\na promising pharmacological tool for investigating the fine-tuning roles of\n$\\beta$-arrestins in 7TMR-driven pathophysiological processes.\n",

This important result seems to be little known outside of ME; even\nin ME, it has not been made clear before that the method gets sometimes the\nright answer, even though the conditions of the NGM theorem are not all\nsatisfied. Thus, beyond the theorem, there is a heuristic approach, the\nvalidity conditions for which are not sufficiently understood.\n  Thirdly, we show that some simple CRN models with absolute concentration\nrobustness (ACR), are close qualitatively to simple ME models, in the sense\nthat they have an unique disease free equilibrium, and a unique interior fixed\npoint, and the latter enters the positive domain and becomes stable precisely\nwhen $R_0:=s_{dfe} \\mathcal{R}=\\frac{s_{dfe}}{s_e}>1.$\n  (where $s$ denotes the \"ACR species\"). Thus, for these \"ME type models\", a\n\"relay phenomena\" takes place: precisely when the DFE loses stability, a new\nfixed point enters the domain, and takes over.\n  Last but not least, we offer in the associated GitHub repository\nhttps://github.com/adhalanay/epidemiology_crns a Mathematica package, Epid-CRN,\nwhich is addressed to researchers of both disciplines, and provide illustrative\nnotebooks, which in particular solve a few minor open ME and CRN problems.

The network, embedded in the\nroot epidermis, contains positive and negative feedback loops, cell-cell\nsignalling within the epidermal tissue, and receives positional signalling from\nunderlying tissue. While there are extensive data regarding individual\ncomponents and their interactions within the network, the sufficiency of the\nregulatory network to produce robust epidermal patterning is not clear, nor is\nit clear how individual components and interactions work together to ensure\ncorrect epidermal patterning. Mathematical modelling was used to address the\nquestions of sufficiency, and to gain an integrated understanding of collective\nbehaviour emerging from individual components and interactions within the\nregulatory network. Theoretical experiments were performed on a model of the\nroot hair patterning regulatory network. It was found that our current\nunderstanding of the epidermal patterning network was insufficient to reproduce\nexperimental data. The model was used to hypothesise the existence of an\nadditional negative feedback loop which, when added to the currently understood\nregulatory network, enabled the model to reproduce wild type and mutant root\nhair patterning. Results of theoretical experiments on the modified regulatory\nnetwork were used to; define an essential relationship between diffusive\nmovement of two cell-cell signalling proteins; show that directed movement\ndysregulation of another cell-cell signalling protein causes root hair\npatterning to appear as though it no longer receives positional cues; and show\nthat cooperativity or oligomerisation within the regulatory network's positive\nfeedback loop are essential.

To define motif generalizations, we first define\n'roles' in a subgraph according to structural equivalence. For example, the\nfeedforward loop triad, a motif in transcription, neuronal and some electronic\nnetworks, has three roles, an input node, an output node and an internal node.\nThe roles are used to define possible generalizations of the motif.

We present algorithms for\nefficiently detecting motif generalizations. We find that the transcription\nnetworks of bacteria and yeast display only one of the three generalizations,\nthe multi-output feedforward generalization. In contrast, the neuronal network\nof \\emph{C. elegans} mainly displays the multi-input generalization.\nForward-logic electronic circuits display a multi-input, multi-output hybrid.\nThus, networks which share a common motif can have very different\ngeneralizations of that motif.

The circuit consists of a kinase and\nphosphatase acting on multiple sites of a substrate that, contingent on its\nmodification state, catalyzes its own phosphorylation and, in a symmetric\nscenario, dephosphorylation. The symmetric case is viewed as a cartoon of\nconflicting feedback that could result from antagonistic pathways impinging on\nthe state of a shared component.\n  Results: Multisite phosphorylation is sufficient for bistable behavior under\nfeedback even when catalysis is linear in substrate concentration, which is the\ncase we consider. We compute the phase diagram, fluctuation spectrum and\nlarge-deviation properties related to switch memory within a statistical\nmechanics framework. Bistability occurs as either a first-order or second-order\nnon-equilibrium phase transition, depending on the network symmetries and the\nratio of phosphatase to kinase numbers. In the second-order case, the circuit\nnever leaves the bistable regime upon increasing the number of substrate\nmolecules at constant kinase to phosphatase ratio.\n  Conclusions: The number of substrate molecules is a key parameter controlling\nboth the onset of the bistable regime, fluctuation intensity, and the residence\ntime in a switched state. The relevance of the concept of memory depends on the\ndegree of switch symmetry, as memory presupposes information to be remembered,\nwhich is highest for equal residence times in the switched states.\n  Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Artem Novozhilov (nominated by Eugene\nKoonin), Sergei Maslov, and Ned Wingreen.\n",

The model postulates that histone acetylation kinetics make\ntranscriptional activation a nonlinear function of [CLK]. Such a nonlinearity\nis essential to simulate robust circadian oscillations of transcription in our\nmodel and in previous models. Simulations suggest two positive feedback loops\ninvolving Clk are not essential for oscillations, because oscillations of [PER]\nwere preserved when Clk, vri, or Pdp-1 expression was fixed. Eliminating the\nnegative feedback loop in which PER represses per expression abolished\noscillations. Simulations of per or Clk null mutations and of vri, Clk, or\nPdp-1 heterozygous null mutations altered model behavior in ways similar to\nexperimental data. The model simulated a photic phase-response curve resembling\nexperimental curves, and oscillations entrained to simulated light-dark cycles.\nThe model makes experimental predictions, some of which could be tested in\ntransgenic Drosophila.\n",

        "summary": "  Membrane receptors for neuromodulators (NM) are highly regulated in their\ndistribution and efficacy - a phenomenon which influences the individual cell's\nresponse to central signals of NM release. Even though NM receptor regulation\nis implicated in the pharmacological action of many drugs, and is also known to\nbe influenced by various environmental factors, its functional consequences and\nmodes of action are not well understood. In this paper we summarize relevant\nexperimental evidence on NM receptor regulation (specifically dopamine D1 and\nD2 receptors) in order to explore its significance for neural and synaptic\nplasticity. We identify the relevant components of NM receptor regulation\n(receptor phosphorylation, receptor trafficking and sensitization of\nsecond-messenger pathways) gained from studies on cultured cells. Key\nprinciples in the regulation and control of short-term plasticity\n(sensitization) are identified, and a model is presented which employs direct\nand indirect feedback regulation of receptor efficacy. We also discuss\nlong-term plasticity which involves shifts in receptor sensitivity and loss of\nresponsivity to NM signals. Finally, we discuss the implications of NM receptor\nregulation for models of brain plasticity and memorization. We emphasize that a\nrealistic model of brain plasticity will have to go beyond Hebbian models of\nlong-term potentiation and depression. Plasticity in the distribution and\nefficacy of NM receptors may provide another important source of functional\nplasticity with implications for learning and memory.\n",

        "summary": "  The promise of discovering a functional blueprint of a cellular system from\nlarge-scale and high-throughput sequence and experimental data is predicated on\nthe belief that the same top-down investigative approach that proved successful\nin other biological problems (e.g. DNA sequencing) will be as effective when it\ncomes to inferring more complex intracellular processes. The results in this\npaper address this fundamental issue in the specific context of transcription\nregulatory networks. Although simple recurring regulatory motifs have been\nidentified in the past, due to the size and complexity of the connectivity\nstructure, the subdivision of such networks into larger, and possibly\ninter-connected, regulatory modules is still under investigation. Specifically,\nit is unclear whether functionally well-characterized transcriptional\nsub-networks can be identified by solely analyzing the connectivity structure\nof the overall network topology. In this paper, we show that transcriptional\nregulatory networks can be systematically partitioned into communities whose\nmembers are consistently functionally related. We applied the partitioning\nmethod to the transcriptional regulatory networks of the yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae; the resulting communities of gene and transcriptional regulators\ncan be associated to distinct functional units, such as amino acid metabolism,\ncell cycle regulation, protein biosynthesis and localization, DNA replication\nand maintenance, lipid catabolism, stress response and so on. Moreover, the\nobservation of inter-community connectivity patterns provides a valuable tool\nfor elucidating the inter-dependency between the discovered regulatory modules.\n",

In\nparticular, biological networks can display a quadratic growth in regulator\nnumber with genome size even while remaining sparsely connected. These features\nare mutually incompatible in standard treatments of network theory which\ntypically require that every new network node possesses at least one\nconnection. To model sparsely connected networks, we generalize existing\napproaches and add each new node with a probabilistic number of links to\ngenerate either accelerating, hyper-accelerating, or even decelerating network\nstatistics in different regimes. Under preferential attachment for example,\nslowly accelerating networks display stationary scale-free statistics\nrelatively independent of network size while more rapidly accelerating networks\ndisplay a transition from scale-free to exponential statistics with network\ngrowth. Such transitions explain, for instance, the evolutionary record of\nsingle-celled organisms which display strict size and complexity limits.\n",

This results in an arrest of the cell\ncycle so that the DNA damage can be repaired. Once this is done, the cell\ncontinues with its usual cycle of activity. We study a mathematical model of\nthe DNA damage checkpoint in the $G_{2}$ phase which arrests the transition\nfrom the $G_{2}$ to the $M$ (mitotic) phase of the cell cycle. The tumor\nsuppressor protein p53 plays a key role in activating the pathways leading to\ncell cycle arrest in mammalian systems. If the DNA damage is severe, the p53\nproteins activate other pathways which bring about apoptosis, i.e., programmed\ncell death. Loss of the p53 gene results in the proliferation of cells\ncontaining damaged DNA, i.e., in the growth of tumors which may ultimately\nbecome cancerous. There is some recent experimental evidence which suggests\nthat the mutation of a single copy of the p53 gene (in the normal cell each\ngene has two identical copies) is sufficient to trigger the formation of\ntumors.

To investigate the mechanisms of Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed\na simple mathematical model of canonical Smad signalling. The model was built\nusing both published data and our experimentally determined cellular Smad\nconcentrations (isoforms 2, 3, and 4). We found in mink lung epithelial cells\nthat Smad2 (8.5-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell) was present in similar amounts to\nSmad4 (9.3-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell), while both were in excess of Smad3\n(1.1-2.0 x 10^4 molecules/cell). Variation of the model parameters and\nstatistical analysis showed that Smad nuclear accumulation is most sensitive to\nparameters affecting the rates of RSmad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation\nand Smad complex formation/dissociation in the nucleus. Deleting Smad4 from the\nmodel revealed that rate-limiting phospho-R-Smad dephosphorylation could be an\nimportant mechanism for Smad nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we observed\nthat binding factors constitutively localised to the nucleus do not efficiently\nmediate Smad nuclear accumulation if dephosphorylation is rapid.

        "summary": "  The molecular network in an organism consists of transcription/translation\nregulation, protein-protein interactions/modifications and a metabolic network,\ntogether forming a system that allows the cell to respond sensibly to the\nmultiple signal molecules that exist in its environment. A key part of this\noverall system of molecular regulation is therefore the interface between the\ngenetic and the metabolic network. A motif that occurs very often at this\ninterface is a negative feedback loop used to regulate the level of the signal\nmolecules. In this work we use mathematical models to investigate the steady\nstate and dynamical behaviour of different negative feedback loops. We show, in\nparticular, that feedback loops where the signal molecule does not cause the\ndissociation of the transcription factor from the DNA respond faster than loops\nwhere the molecule acts by sequestering transcription factors off the DNA. We\nuse three examples, the bet, mer and lac systems in E. coli, to illustrate the\nbehaviour of such feedback loops.\n",

For a simple 2-step enzymatic cascade\nwhich underlies many important protein signaling pathways, we demonstrated that\nthe commonly used techniques such as the linear noise approximation and the\nLangevin equation become inadequate when the number of proteins becomes too\nlow.

In particular, monotone systems respond in a predictable\nfashion to perturbations and have robust and ordered dynamical characteristics,\nmaking them reliable components of larger networks. Interconnections of\nmonotone systems may be fruitfully analyzed using tools from control theory, by\nviewing larger systems as interconnections of monotone subsystems.

In our model, two types of replicating\nmolecules, denoted A and B, are present in some initial concentration in the\nchemostat. Molecules A and B are stimulated to replicate by some growth\nfactors, denoted GA and GB, respectively. It is also assumed that A and B can\ncovalently link, and that the conjugated molecule can be stimulated by either\nthe GA or GB growth factors (and can be degraded). We show that, if the\nchemostat is stimulated by both growth factors for a certain time, followed by\na time gap during which the chemostat is not stimulated at all, and if the\nchemostat is then stimulated again by only one of the growth factors, then\nthere will be a transient increase in the number of molecules activated by the\nother growth factor. Therefore, the chemostat bears the imprint of earlier,\nsimultaneous stimulation with both growth factors, which is indicative of\nassociative learning. It is interesting to note that the dynamics of our model\nis consistent with various aspects of Pavlov's original series of associative\nlearning experiments in dogs.

        "summary": "  The E.coli transcription network has an essentially feedforward structure,\nwith, however, abundant feedback at the level of self-regulations. Here, we\ninvestigate how these properties emerged during evolution. An assessment of the\nrole of gene duplication based on protein domain architecture shows that (i)\ntranscriptional autoregulators have mostly arisen through duplication, while\n(ii) the expected feedback loops stemming from their initial cross-regulation\nare strongly selected against. This requires a divergent coevolution of the\ntranscription factor DNA-binding sites and their respective DNA cis-regulatory\nregions. Moreover, we find that the network tends to grow by expansion of the\nexisting hierarchical layers of computation, rather than by addition of new\nlayers. We also argue that rewiring of regulatory links due to\nmutation/selection of novel transcription factor/DNA binding interactions\nappears not to significantly affect the network global hierarchy, and that\nhorizontally transferred genes are mainly added at the bottom, as new target\nnodes. These findings highlight the important evolutionary roles of both\nduplication and selective deletion of crosstalks between autoregulators in the\nemergence of the hierarchical transcription network of E.coli.\n",

This is achieved by\nfirst identifying and removing links which close up feedback loops in the\noriginal network and hierarchically arranging nodes in the remaining network.\nIn mathematical language this corresponds to a problem of making a graph\nacyclic by removing as few links as possible and thus altering the original\ngraph in the least possible way. Practically in all applications the exact\nsolution of this problem requires an enumeration of all combinations of removed\nlinks, which is computationally intractable. We introduce and compare two\nalgorithms: the deterministic, 'greedy' algorithm that preferentially cuts the\nlinks that participate in the largest number of feedback cycles, and the\nprobabilistic one based on a simulated annealing of a hierarchical layout of\nthe network which minimizes the number of ``backward'' links going from lower\nto higher hierarchical levels. We find that the annealing algorithm outperforms\nthe deterministic one in terms of speed, memory requirement, and the actual\nnumber of removed links. Implications for system biology and directions for\nfurther research are discussed.\n",

One of the main contributors\nto the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be\ntheir modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are\nstrongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other\nmodules. Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and\nrobustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing\namount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous\nfeatures of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free\nedge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks\nevolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to\nstudy modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic\npoints of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of\nmodularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the\nyeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal pairs consist\nmostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within\nmodules, while knockdown suppressor pairs are farther apart and often straddle\nmodules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways\nor modules. The combination of network modularity tools together with genetic\ninteraction data constitutes a powerful approach to study and dissect the role\nof modularity in the evolution and function of biological networks.\n",

We show that for an arbitrary constant 0<c<2 and sufficiently\nlarge n there exist n-dimensional cooperative Boolean networks in which both\nthe indegree and outdegree of each variable is bounded by two, and which\nnevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n.

How protein concentration fluctuations affect the\ngrowth rate of a population of cells, is, however, a wide open question. We\npresent a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of\nprotein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of\ngenetically identical cells. The model predicts that the population's growth\nrate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein\nconcentration, the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations, and the\ncorrelation time of these fluctuations. The model also predicts that when the\naverage concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the\ngrowth rate, fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate.\nHowever, when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the\noptimal level, fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population, even\nwhen the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration.\nThe model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity,\nsuch as the average protein expression level or its variance, is in general not\nequal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its\ndescendants. We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene\nregulatory control. Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of\na gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of\nsynthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the\nfluctuations in the expression of its target gene.

We\nassess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these\nswitches: TF-TF homodimerisation and TF-DNA association/dissociation. We\nfactorise the flipping rate k into the product of the probability rho(q*) of\nfinding the system at the dividing surface (separatrix) between the two stable\nstates, and a kinetic prefactor R. In the case of the exclusive switch, the\nrate of TF-operator binding affects both rho(q*) and R, while the rate of TF\ndimerisation affects only R. In the case of the general switch both TF-operator\nbinding and TF dimerisation affect k, R and rho(q*). To elucidate this, we\nanalyse the transition state ensemble (TSE). For the exclusive switch, varying\nthe rate of TF-operator binding can drastically change the pathway of\nswitching, while changing the rate of dimerisation changes the switching rate\nwithout altering the mechanism. The switching pathways of the general switch\nare highly robust to changes in the rate constants of both TF-operator and\nTF-TF binding, even though these rate constants do affect the flipping rate;\nthis feature is unique for non-equilibrium systems.\n",

A recent model (48) predicts bistability due to interactions of\nthe kinases and phosphatases in the MAPK pathway, without feedback from MAPK to\nearlier reactions. Using this model and enzyme concentrations appropriate for\nneurons, we simulated bistable MAPK activity, but bistability only was present\nwithin a relatively narrow range of activity of Raf, the first pathway kinase.\nStochastic fluctuations in molecule numbers eliminated bistability for small\nmolecule numbers, such as are expected in the volume of a dendritic spine.\nHowever, positive feedback loops have been posited from MAPK up to Raf\nactivation. One proposed loop in which MAPK directly activates Raf was\nincorporated into the model. We found that such feedback greatly enhanced the\nrobustness of both stable states of MAPK activity to stochastic fluctuations\nand to parameter variations. Bistability was robust for molecule numbers\nplausible for a dendritic spine volume. The upper state of MAPK activity was\nresistant to inhibition of MEK activation for > 1 h, suggesting inhibitor\nexperiments have not sufficed to rule out a role for persistent MAPK activity\nin LTP maintenance. These simulations suggest that persistent MAPK activity and\nconsequent upregulation of translation may contribute to LTP maintenance and to\nlong-term memory.

We use a quantitative approach to\ncompare and contrast sRNAs with conventional transcription factors (TFs) to\nbetter understand the advantages of each form of regulation. In particular, we\ncalculate the steady-state behavior, noise properties, frequency-dependent gain\n(amplification), and dynamical response to large input signals of both forms of\nregulation. While the mean steady-state behavior of sRNA-regulated proteins\nexhibits a distinctive tunable threshold-linear behavior, our analysis shows\nthat transcriptional bursting leads to significantly higher intrinsic noise in\nsRNA-based regulation than in TF-based regulation in a large range of\nexpression levels and limits the ability of sRNAs to perform quantitative\nsignaling. Nonetheless, we find that sRNAs are better than TFs at filtering\nnoise in input signals. Additionally, we find that sRNAs allow cells to respond\nrapidly to large changes in input signals. These features suggest a niche for\nsRNAs in allowing cells to transition quickly yet reliably between distinct\nstates. This functional niche is consistent with the widespread appearance of\nsRNAs in stress-response and quasi-developmental networks in prokaryotes.\n",

Although the\nintrinsic stochasticity inherent in biochemistry is relatively well understood,\ncellular variation, or 'noise', is predominantly generated by interactions of\nthe system of interest with other stochastic systems in the cell or its\nenvironment. Such extrinsic fluctuations are nonspecific, affecting many system\ncomponents, and have a substantial lifetime, comparable to the cell cycle (they\nare 'colored'). Here, we extend the standard stochastic simulation algorithm to\ninclude extrinsic fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations affect mean\nprotein numbers and intrinsic noise, can speed up typical network response\ntimes, and can explain trends in high-throughput measurements of variation. If\nextrinsic fluctuations in two components of the network are correlated, they\nmay combine constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively\n(attenuating each other). Consequently, we predict that incoherent feedforward\nloops attenuate stochasticity, while coherent feedforwards amplify it. Our\nresults demonstrate that both the timescales of extrinsic fluctuations and\ntheir nonspecificity substantially affect the function and performance of\nbiochemical networks.\n",

The quorum-sensing network\nof the marine bacterium {\\it Vibrio harveyi} employs three autoinducers, each\nknown to encode distinct ecological information. Yet how cells integrate and\ninterpret the information contained within the three autoinducer signals\nremains a mystery. Here, we develop a new framework for analyzing signal\nintegration based on Information Theory and use it to analyze quorum sensing in\n{\\it V. harveyi}.

The control of transcription is the\nmost dominant type of regulation mediated by a complex of molecules such as\ntranscription factors. In general, regulatory molecules are of two types:\nactivator and repressor. Activators promote the initiation of transcription\nwhereas repressors inhibit transcription. In many cases, they regulate the gene\ntranscription on binding the promoter mutually exclusively and the observed\ngene expression response is either graded or binary. In experiments, the gene\nexpression response is quantified by the amount of proteins produced on varying\nthe concentration of an external inducer molecules in the cell. In this paper,\nwe study a gene regulatory network where activators and repressors both bind\nthe same promoter mutually exclusively. The network is modeled by assuming that\nthe gene can be in three possible states: repressed, unregulated and active. An\nexact analytical expression for the steady-state probability distribution of\nprotein levels is then derived. The exact result helps to explain the\nexperimental observations that in the presence of activator molecules the\nresponse is graded at all inducer levels whereas in the presence of both\nactivator and repressor molecules, the response is graded at low and high\ninducer levels and binary at an intermediate inducer level.\n",

Often Boolean models are much simpler to understand than complex\ndifferential equations models. The motivation for this work comes from\nmathematical systems biology. While Boolean mechanisms do not provide\ninformation about exact concentration rates or time scales, they are often\nsufficient to capture steady states and other key dynamics. Due to their\nintuitive nature, such models are very appealing to researchers in the life\nsciences. This paper is focused on dynamical systems that exhibit bistability\nand are desc ribedby delay equations. It is shown that if a certain motif\nincluding a feedback loop is present in the wiring diagram of the system, the\nBoolean model captures the bistability of molecular switches. The method is\nappl ied to two examples from biology, the lac operon and the phage lambda\nlysis/lysogeny switch.\n",

Circadian\nbiology has been one notable exception: quantitative models of the internal\nclock that orchestrates biological processes over the 24-hour diurnal cycle\nhave been constructed for a few organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and\nmammals.

To this end, we must understand both the\nnoise characteristics and the amplification properties of networks. In this\nmanuscript, we use information theory to study how reliably signalling cascades\nemploying autoregulation and feedback can transmit time-varying signals. We\ncalculate the frequency-dependence of the gain-to-noise ratio, which reflects\nhow reliably a network transmits signals at different frequencies. We find that\nthe gain-to-noise ratio may differ qualitatively from the power spectrum of the\noutput, showing that the latter does not directly reflect signaling\nperformance. Moreover, we find that auto-activation and auto-repression\nincrease and decrease the gain-to-noise ratio for all of frequencies,\nrespectively. Positive feedback specifically enhances information transmission\nat low frequencies, while negative feedback increases signal fidelity at high\nfrequencies. Our analysis not only elucidates the role of autoregulation and\nfeedback in naturally-occurring biological networks, but also reveals design\nprinciples that can be used for the reliable transmission of time-varying\nsignals in synthetic gene circuits.\n",

They are known to\nplay an important role in several biological processes and, together with\ntranscription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory\nnetwork. Looking at the structure of this network it is possible to recognize a\nfew overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary\nregulatory functions. Among them a special role is played by the\nmicroRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor\nregulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this\npaper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version\nof this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an\nefficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall\ngene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream\nregulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is\nthat the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression\nof the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected\nfine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the\nactual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their\ntargets. Finally we describe the impact on noise-buffering efficiency of the\ncross-talk between microRNA targets that can naturally arise if the\nmicroRNA-mediated circuit is not considered as isolated, but embedded in a\nlarger network of regulations.\n",

This work focuses on the simultaneous modeling of the metabolic\ndegradation of pectin by Pel enzymes and the genetic regulation of pel genes by\n2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), a catabolite product of pectin which inactivates\nKdgR, one of the main repressors of pel genes. This modeling scheme takes into\naccount the fact that the system is composed of two time-varying compartments:\nthe extracellular medium, where Pel enzymes cleave pectin into oligomers, and\nthe bacterial cytoplasm where, after internalization, oligomers are converted\nto KDG. Using the quasi-stationary state approximations, the model consists of\nsome nonlinear differential equations for which most of the parameters could be\nestimated from the literature or from independent experiments. The few\nremaining unknown parameters were obtained by fitting the model equations\nagainst a set of Pel activity data. Model predictions were verified by\nmeasuring the time courses of bacterial growth, Pel production, pel mRNA\naccumulation and pectin consumption under various growth conditions. This work\nreveals that pectin is almost totally consumed before the burst of Pel\nproduction. This paradoxical behaviour can be interpreted as an evolutionary\nstrategy to control the diffusion process so that as soon as a small amount of\npectin is detected by the bacteria in its surroundings it anticipates more\npectin to come. The model also predicts the possibility of bistable steady\nstates in the presence of constant pectin compounds.\n",

We employ stochastic\ndifferential equations and probability distributions obtained from stochastic\nsimulations to characterize differential signaling response in our minimal\nnetwork model. We show that the proposed minimal signaling network displays two\ndistinct types of response as the strength of the stimulus is decreased. The\nsignaling network has a deterministic part that undergoes rapid activation by a\nstrong stimulus in which case cell-to-cell fluctuations can be ignored. As the\nstrength of the stimulus decreases, the stochastic part of the network begins\ndominating the signaling response where slow activation is observed with\ncharacteristic large cell-to-cell stochastic variability.

        "summary": "  Cancer cells are widely known to be protected from apoptosis, which is a\nmajor hurdle to successful anti-cancer therapy. Over-expression of several\nanti-apoptotic proteins, or mutations in pro-apoptotic factors, has been\nrecognized to confer such resistance. Development of new experimental\nstrategies, such as in silico modeling of biological pathways, can increase our\nunderstanding of how abnormal regulation of apoptotic pathway in cancer cells\ncan lead to tumour chemoresistance. Monte Carlo simulations are in particular\nwell suited to study inherent variability, such as spatial heterogeneity and\ncell-to-cell variations in signaling reactions. Using this approach, often in\ncombination with experimental validation of the computational model, we\nobserved that large cell-to-cell variability could explain the kinetics of\napoptosis, which depends on the type of pathway and the strength of stress\nstimuli. Most importantly, Monte Carlo simulations of apoptotic signaling\nprovides unexpected insights into the mechanisms of fractional cell killing\ninduced by apoptosis-inducing agents, showing that not only variation in\nprotein levels, but also inherent stochastic variability in signaling\nreactions, can lead to survival of a fraction of treated cancer cells.\n",

The metabolic network of any one organism is encoded by a\nmetabolic genotype, defined by a set of enzyme-coding genes whose products\ncatalyze the network's reactions. Each metabolic genotype has a metabolic\nphenotype, such as the ability to synthesize biomass on a spectrum of different\nsources of chemical elements and energy. We here focus on sulfur metabolism,\nwhich is attractive to study the evolution of metabolic networks, because it\ninvolves many fewer reactions than carbon metabolism. Specifically, we study\nproperties of the space of all possible metabolic genotypes, and analyze\nproperties of random metabolic genotypes that are viable on different numbers\nof sulfur sources. We show that metabolic genotypes with the same phenotype\nform large connected genotype networks that extend far through metabolic\ngenotype space. How far they reach through this space is a linear function of\nthe number of super-essential reactions in such networks, the number of\nreactions that occur in all networks with the same phenotype. We show that\ndifferent neighborhoods of any genotype network harbor very different novel\nphenotypes, metabolic innovations that can sustain life on novel sulfur\nsources. We also analyze the ability of evolving populations of metabolic\nnetworks to explore novel metabolic phenotypes. This ability is facilitated by\nthe existence of genotype networks, because different neighborhoods of these\nnetworks contain very different novel phenotypes. In contrast to\nmacromolecules, where phenotypic robustness may facilitate phenotypic\ninnovation, we show that here the ability to access novel phenotypes does not\nmonotonically increase with robustness.\n",

However, little is known about expressions driven by\ntrans-acting DNA hotspots. DNA hotspots harboring copy number aberrations are\nrecognized to be important in cancer as they influence multiple genes on a\nglobal scale. The challenge in detecting trans-effects is mainly due to the\ncomputational difficulty in detecting weak and sparse trans-acting signals\namidst co-occuring passenger events.

New\nmeasurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a\npathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate\nparameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the\ndisagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method\nfits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches\nthe derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each\nspecies. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt\nto match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the\nODEs. The new objective function is an extreme decomposition of the problem\nbecause each factor in the function is enforcing the equality of one ODE at one\ntimeslice. A \"loopy belief propagation\" algorithm solves this factorized\napproximation of the parameter estimation problem providing systematic coverage\nof the search space and unique asymptotic behavior; the run time is polynomial\nin the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the\nbiochemical network. The implementation is a global-local hybrid optimization,\nand we compare with the performance of local, global, and hybrid methods.

It has been established experimentally that genes which are regulated\nat elongation tend to express faster and more synchronously; however, it has\nnot been shown directly whether or not it is the change in the regulated step\n{\\em per se} that causes this increase in speed and synchrony.

A single gene with negative transcriptional\nfeedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the\ntransmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A\nsingle gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce\noscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction\nwith a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine\na model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive\nfeedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and\nactivates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a\nrepressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A\nstochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic\nstudy identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two\ntypes of biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and\nthis protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual\nnegative interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting\non the positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient\ncondition to produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive\ntranscriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor\ngene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop\nis not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the\nformation of protein multimers. Therefore, our findings could help to clarify\nthe design principles of cellular clocks and constitute a new efficient tool\nfor engineering synthetic genetic oscillators.\n",

Of particular\nimportance is the question of how the model structure constrains its dynamics.\nThis paper discusses an algebraic framework to study such questions. The\nsystems discussed here are given by mappings on an affine space over a finite\nfield, whose coordinate functions are polynomials. They form a general class of\nmodels which can represent many discrete model types. Assigning to such a\nsystem its dependency graph, that is, the directed graph that indicates the\nvariable dependencies, provides a mapping from systems to graphs. A basic\nproperty of this mapping is derived and used to prove that dynamical systems\nwith an acyclic dependency graph can only have a unique fixed point in their\nphase space and no periodic orbits. This result is then applied to a published\nmodel of in vitro virus competition.\n",

In\ncontrast to this countable set of parameters, the estimation of entire courses\nof network components corresponds to an innumerable set of parameters. The\napproach presented in this work is able to deal with course estimation for\nextrinsic system inputs or intrinsic reactants, both not being constrained by\nthe reaction network itself. Our method is based on variational calculus which\nis carried out analytically to derive an augmented system of differential\nequations including the unconstrained components as ordinary state variables.\nFinally, conventional parameter estimation is applied to the augmented system\nresulting in a combined estimation of courses and parameters. The combined\nestimation approach takes the uncertainty in input courses correctly into\naccount. This leads to precise parameter estimates and correct confidence\nintervals. In particular this implies that small motifs of large reaction\nnetworks can be analysed independently of the rest.

The reduction is a\nbulk effect: a cluster presents a smaller effective target to a substrate\nmolecule in the bulk. The enhancement, on the other hand, is a local effect: a\ncluster promotes the rapid rebinding and second activation of singly active\nsubstrate molecules. As such, the enhancement relies upon frequent collisions\non a short timescale, which leads to a diffusion coefficient at which the\nenhancement is optimal. We complement simulation with analytic results at both\nthe mean-field and first-passage distribution levels.

The prior construction of the flux cone is computationally expensive and\nno polynomial-time algorithms are known.

These signaling processes strongly differ in\ntype with TGFb ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members\nof the TGFb family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then\nbe expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand\nconcentration. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications\nthat are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGFb signaling\nnetwork. To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the\ncore of the TGFb signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we\nidentified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give\nrise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as\nwell as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to\ntime-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens).\nA combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus\nbiases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while\noscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the\nturn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient\nreceptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding.\nWe find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the\nresponse type. The architecture of the TGFb pathway enables the observed\nsignaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGFb ligand in\ndifferent cell types and under different conditions can be explained with\ndifferences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective\nrate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways.\n",

They are involved in core\ncellular processes and their dysregulation is associated to a broad range of\nhuman diseases. This paper focus on a minimal microRNA-mediated regulatory\ncircuit, in which a protein-coding gene (host gene) is targeted by a microRNA\nlocated inside one of its introns. Results: Autoregulation via intronic\nmicroRNAs is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our\nbioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its\nsimple topology. Our analysis, based on analytical calculations and\nsimulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene\nexpression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and Weber's\nlaw, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network\nto the host gene. A fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of\nthese functions. Interestingly, they are all related to gene expression\nhomeostasis, in agreement with the increasing evidence suggesting a role of\nmicroRNA regulation in conferring robustness to biological processes. In\naddition to model analysis, we present a list of bioinformatically predicted\ncandidate circuits in human for future experimental tests. Conclusions: The\nresults presented here suggest a potentially relevant functional role for\nnegative self-regulation via intronic microRNAs, in particular as a homeostatic\ncontrol mechanism of gene expression.

We present a mathematical model that aims to understand how small RNA\ncompetition for the PTR resources affects target gene repression. We discuss\nthat small RNA activity is limited by RISC-formation, RISC-degradation and the\navailability of Argonautes.

We use a quantitative model\nto study gene regulation by inhibitory microRNAs and compare it to gene\nregulation by prokaryotic small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Our model uses a\ncombination of analytic techniques as well as computational simulations to\ncalculate the mean-expression and noise profiles of genes regulated by both\nmicroRNAs and sRNAs. We find that despite very different molecular machinery\nand modes of action (catalytic vs stoichiometric), the mean expression levels\nand noise profiles of microRNA-regulated genes are almost identical to genes\nregulated by prokaryotic sRNAs. This behavior is extremely robust and persists\nacross a wide range of biologically relevant parameters. We extend our model to\nstudy crosstalk between multiple mRNAs that are regulated by a single microRNA\nand show that noise is a sensitive measure of microRNA-mediated interaction\nbetween mRNAs. We conclude by discussing possible experimental strategies for\nuncovering the microRNA-mRNA interactions and testing the competing endogenous\nRNA (ceRNA) hypothesis.\n",

Recent\nwork suggests that modularity can evolve in a variety of circumstances,\nincluding goals that vary in time such that they share the same subgoals\n(modularly varying goals), or when connections are costly. Here, we studied the\norigin of modularity and sparseness focusing on the nature of the mutation\nprocess, rather than on connection cost or variations in the goal. We use\nsimulations of evolution with different mutation rules. We found that commonly\nused sum-rule mutations, in which interactions are mutated by adding random\nnumbers, do not lead to modularity or sparseness except for in special\nsituations. In contrast, product-rule mutations in which interactions are\nmutated by multiplying by random numbers - a better model for the effects of\nbiological mutations - led to sparseness naturally. When the goals of evolution\nare modular, in the sense that specific groups of inputs affect specific groups\nof outputs, product-rule mutations also lead to modular structure; sum-rule\nmutations do not. Product-rule mutations generate sparseness and modularity\nbecause they tend to reduce interactions, and to keep small interaction terms\nsmall.\n",

For some\nchemical reaction systems, more than two moments are necessary to describe the\ndynamic properties of the system, which the linear noise approximation (LNA) is\nunable to provide. Moreover, also for systems for which the mean does not have\na strong dependence on higher order moments, moment approximation methods give\ninformation about higher order moments of the underlying probability\ndistribution.

The main virtues of this approach\nare the following: (i) it provides a natural way to obtain arbitrarily large\nnetworks by coupling together simple basic pieces, thus revealing the\nmodularity of regulatory networks; (ii) the assumptions about the stochastic\nprocesses used in the modeling are fairly general, in the sense that the only\nrequirement is stationarity; (iii) there is a well developed mathematical\ntheory, which is a blend of smooth dynamical systems theory, ergodic theory and\nstochastic analysis that allows one to extract relevant dynamical and\nstatistical information without solving the system; (iv) one may obtain the\nclassical rate equations form the corresponding stochastic version by averaging\nthe dynamic random variables (small noise limit). It is important to emphasize\nthat unlike the deterministic case, where coupling two equations is a trivial\nmatter, coupling two RDS is non-trivial, specially in our case, where the\ncoupling is performed between a state variable of one gene and the switching\nstochastic process of another gene and, hence, it is not a priori true that the\nresulting coupled system will satisfy the definition of a random dynamical\nsystem.

For the network of core metabolic\nprocesses, the dynamic optimization algorithm predicted commonly observed\nmetabolic adaptations, such as a diauxic switch with a preference ranking for\ndifferent nutrients, re-utilization of waste products after depletion of the\noriginal substrate, and metabolic adaptation to an impending nutrient\ndepletion. These examples illustrate how dynamic adaptations of enzyme\nexpression can be predicted solely from an optimization principle.\n",

Diffusion of transcription factors can increase noise in\ngene expression, while diffusion of proteins between intracellular compartments\nor between cells can reduce concentration fluctuations. In push-pull networks\ndiffusion can impede information transmission, while in multi-site protein\nmodification networks diffusion can qualitatively change the macroscopic\nresponse of the system, such as the loss or emergence of bistability. Moreover,\ndiffusion can directly change the metabolic flux. We describe how crowding\naffects diffusion, and thus how all these phenomena are influenced by crowding.\nYet, a potentially more important effect of crowding on biochemical networks is\nmediated via the shift in the equilibria of bimolecular reactions, and we\nprovide computational evidence that supports this idea. Finally, we discuss how\nthe effects of crowding can be incorporated in models of biochemical networks.\n",

Therefore, their\nvalues must be estimated from time-series experimental data.\n  In recent years, it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models\nare universally sloppy so their parameters cannot be uniquely estimated.

These self-sustained rhythms are coordinated and\nentrained by a master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).\nWithin the SCN, the individual rhythms of each neuron are synchronized through\nintercellular signaling. One important feature of SCN is that the synchronized\nperiod is close to the cell population mean of intrinsic periods. In this way,\nthe synchronized period of the SCN stays close to the periods of cells in\nperipheral tissues. This is important for SCN to entrain cells throughout the\nbody. However, the mechanism that drives the period of the coupled SCN cells to\nthe population mean is not known. We use mathematical modeling and analysis to\nshow that the mechanism of transcription repression plays a pivotal role in\nregulating the coupled period. Specifically, we use phase response curve\nanalysis to show that the coupled period within the SCN stays near the\npopulation mean if transcriptional repression occurs via protein sequestration.\nIn contrast, the coupled period is far from the mean if repression occurs\nthrough highly nonlinear Hill-type regulation (e.g. oligomer- or\nphosphorylation-based repression). Furthermore, we find that the timescale of\nintercellular coupling needs to be fast compared to that of intracellular\nfeedback to maintain the mean period. These findings reveal the important\nrelationship between the intracellular transcriptional feedback loop and\nintercellular coupling. This relationship explains why transcriptional\nrepression appears to occur via protein sequestration in multicellular\norganisms, mammals and Drosophila, in contrast with the phosphorylation-based\nrepression in unicellular organisms.

As a result, fast\nelementary reactions are not modeled explicitly, and their effect is captured\nby non-elementary reaction rate functions (e.g. Hill functions). The accuracy\nof the QSSA applied to deterministic systems depends on how well timescales are\nseparated. Recently, it has been proposed to use the non-elementary rate\nfunctions obtained via the deterministic QSSA to define propensity functions in\nstochastic simulations of biochemical networks. In this approach, termed the\nstochastic QSSA, fast reactions that are part of non-elementary reactions are\nnot simulated, greatly reducing computation time. However, it is unclear when\nthe stochastic QSSA provides an accurate approximation of the original\nstochastic simulation. We show that, unlike the deterministic QSSA, the\nvalidity of the stochastic QSSA does not follow from timescale separation\nalone, but also depends on the sensitivity of the non-elementary reaction rate\nfunctions to changes in the slow species. The stochastic QSSA becomes more\naccurate when this sensitivity is small.

Epistasis\nis critical for understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes,\nincluding pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction, mutational\nload, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the origin of life.\nNevertheless, current understandings for the genome-wide distribution of\nepistasis are mostly inferred from interactions among one mutant type per gene,\nwhereas how epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different\nmutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we address this issue\nby combining predictions from flux balance analysis and data from a recently\npublished high-throughput experiment. Our results show that different alleles\ncan epistatically interact with very different gene sets. Furthermore, between\ntwo random mutant alleles of the same gene, the chance for the allele with more\nsevere mutational consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative\nepistasis than the other allele is 50-70% in eukaryotic organisms, but only\n20-30% in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model that\npredicts that the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can speed up\nthe process of purging deleterious mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our\nresults indicate that epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the\ngenome level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can integrate\nepistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems.\n",

Understanding the\nglobal epistatic landscape is vital for many genetic and evolutionary theories.\nCurrent knowledge for epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited\nby the technological difficulties in experimentally screening epistatic\nrelations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance analysis\nto simulate epistatic landscapes under various environmental perturbations.\nSpecifically, we looked at gene-gene epistatic interactions, where the\nmutations were assumed to occur in different genes. We predicted that epistasis\ntends to become more positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting\nconditions, indicating that selection might be less effective in removing\ndeleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of\nepistatic interactions in all tested conditions, as well as many epistatic\ninteractions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes in the stable\nepistatic interaction network are directly linked to most other genes whereas\ngenes with condition-specific epistasis form a scale-free network. Furthermore,\ngenes with stable epistasis tend to have similar evolutionary rates, whereas\nthis co-evolving relationship does not hold for genes with condition-specific\nepistasis.

They consist of two\ngenes, encoding a transcription factor and a small non-coding RNA (sRNA), which\nmutually regulate each other's expression. We present a theoretical and\nnumerical study of coherent mixed feedback loops of this type, in which both\nregulations are negative. Under suitable conditions, these feedback loops are\nexpected to exhibit bistability, namely two stable states, one dominated by the\ntranscriptional repressor and the other dominated by the sRNA. We use\ndeterministic methods based on rate equation models, in order to identify the\nrange of parameters in which bistability takes place. However, the\ndeterministic models do not account for the finite lifetimes of the bistable\nstates and the spontaneous, fluctuation-driven transitions between them.\nTherefore, we use stochastic methods to calculate the average lifetimes of the\ntwo states. It is found that these lifetimes strongly depend on rate\ncoefficients such as the transcription rates of the transcriptional repressor\nand the sRNA. In particular, we show that the fraction of time the system\nspends in the sRNA dominated state follows a monotonically decreasing sigmoid\nfunction of the transcriptional repressor transcription rate.

Here we demonstrate that these two methods can be\ncombined and deployed together by means of a new sensitivity bound which\nincorporates the variance of the quantity of interest as well as the Fisher\nInformation Matrix estimated from the first method. The first step of the\nproposed strategy labels sensitivities using the bound and screens out the\ninsensitive parameters in a controlled manner based also on the new sensitivity\nbound.

Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a\nsimple probabilistic model in which a free parameter $\\gamma$ controls the\ndegree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the\nmodel predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also\nfeedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and\nfeedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio-\ntechnological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical\nnetworks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network\nrandomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively\nreproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter\n$\\gamma$. Moreover, the fitted value of $\\gamma$ correlates quite well with\nanother direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a\nnovel algorithm.

In this work, we resolve\nthese problems by extending the work on the fluctuation decomposition and the\ndual reporter system. For a single-loop feedback network with two components,\nwe define feedback loop gain as the feedback efficiency that is consistent with\nthe fluctuation decomposition for feedforward networks. Then, we clarify the\nrelation of the feedback efficiency with the fluctuation propagation in an\nopen-looped FF network. Finally, by extending the dual reporter system, we\npropose a conjugate feedback and feedforward system for estimating the feedback\nefficiency only from the statistics of the system non-perturbatively.\n",

In\naddition, our quartic equation A(S,E)=0 differs to Michaelis-Menten curve less\nthan the order of $1/S^3$ as S approaches $+\\infty$.\n  By considering the above merits of A(S,E)=0, we suggest it as a replacement\nof Michaelis-Menten curve.

In this work we integrated existing information on OR expression,\nand constructed a comprehensive model that has all its components based on\nphysical interactions. Analyzing the model reveals an evolutionarily optimized\nthree-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal segregation, epigenetic\nbarrier crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop that mechanistically\ndiffers from previous theoretical proposals, and a previously unidentified\nenhancer competition step. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR\nexpression, but also elucidates how the olfactory system maximizes and\nmaintains the diversity of OR expression, and has multiple predictions\nvalidated by existing experimental results.

Its deterministic Boolean network model predicts that\ntwo parallel pathways with comparable magnitudes of attractive basins should\nexist after the protein p53 is activated when a cell becomes harmfully\ndisturbed. Once the low but non-neglectable intrinsic fluctuations are\nincorporated into the model, we show that a phase transition phenomenon is\nemerged: in one parameter region the probability weights of the normal pathway,\nreported in experimental literature, are comparable with the other pathway\nwhich is seemingly abnormal with the unknown functions, whereas, in some other\nparameter regions, the probability weight of the abnormal pathway can even\ndominate and become globally attractive. The theory of exponentially perturbed\nMarkov chains is applied and further generalized in order to quantitatively\nexplain such a phase transition phenomenon, in which the nonequilibrium\n\"activation energy barriers\" along each transiting trajectory between the\nparallel pathways and the number of \"optimal transition paths\" play a central\npart.

IsoRank is one of the first global network alignment\nalgorithms [4, 5, 6], where the goal is to match all (or most) of the nodes of\ntwo PPI networks. The IsoRank algorithm first computes a pairwise node\nsimilarity metric, and then generates a matching between the two node sets\nbased on this metric. The metric is a convex combination of a structural\nsimilarity score (with weight $ \\alpha $) and an extraneous amino-acid sequence\nsimilarity score for two proteins (with weight $ 1 - \\alpha $). In this short\npaper, we make two contributions. First, we show that when IsoRank similarity\ndepends only on network structure ($\\alpha = 1$), the similarity of two nodes\nis only a function of their degrees. In other words, IsoRank similarity is\ninvariant to any network rewiring that does not affect the node degrees. This\nresult suggests a reason for the poor performance of IsoRank in structure-only\n($ \\alpha = 1 $) alignment. Second, using ideas from [7, 8], we develop an\napproximation algorithm that outperforms IsoRank (including recent versions\nwith better scaling, e.g., [9]) by several orders of magnitude in time and\nmemory complexity, despite only a negligible loss in precision.\n",

For a biological\nprocess, a number of proteins need to work together to perform the job.\nProteins densely interact with each other, forming large molecular machines or\ncellular building blocks. Identification of such densely interconnected\nclusters or protein complexes from PPI networks enables us to obtain a better\nunderstanding of the hierarchy and organization of biological processes and\ncellular components. Most existing methods apply efficient graph clustering\nalgorithms on PPI networks, often failing to detect possible densely connected\nsubgraphs and overlapped subgraphs. Besides clustering-based methods, dense\nsubgraph enumeration methods have also been used, which aim to find all densely\nconnected protein sets. However, such methods are not practically tractable\neven on a small yeast PPI network, due to high computational complexity. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approximate algorithm to efficiently enumerate\nputative protein complexes from biological networks. The key insight of our\nalgorithm is that we do not need to enumerate all dense subgraphs. Instead we\nonly need to find a small subset of subgraphs that cover as many proteins as\npossible. The problem is formulated as finding a diverse set of dense\nsubgraphs, where we develop highly effective pruning techniques to guarantee\nefficiency. To handle large networks, we take a divide-and-conquer approach to\nspeed up the algorithm in a distributed manner. By comparing with existing\nclustering and dense subgraph-based algorithms on several human and yeast PPI\nnetworks, we demonstrate that our method can detect more putative protein\ncomplexes and achieves better prediction accuracy.\n",

We use a\nlatent tree graphical model to analyze gene expression without relying on\ntranscription factor expression as a proxy for regulator activity. The latent\ntree model is a type of Markov random field that includes both observed gene\nvariables and latent (hidden) variables, which factorize on a Markov tree.\nThrough efficient unsupervised learning approaches, we determine which groups\nof genes are co-regulated by hidden regulators and the activity levels of those\nregulators. Post-processing annotates many of these discovered latent variables\nas specific transcription factors or groups of transcription factors. Other\nlatent variables do not necessarily represent physical regulators but instead\nreveal hidden structure in the gene expression such as shared biological\nfunction. We apply the latent tree graphical model to a yeast stress response\ndataset. In addition to novel predictions, such as condition-specific binding\nof the transcription factor Msn4, our model recovers many known aspects of the\nyeast regulatory network. These include groups of co-regulated genes,\ncondition-specific regulator activity, and combinatorial regulation among\ntranscription factors.

However, multilevel variables are often required to account for\nthreshold effects, in which knowledge of the Boolean case does not generalise\nstraightforwardly. This motivated the development of conversion methods for\nmultilevel to Boolean models. In particular, Van Ham's method has been shown to\nyield a one-to-one, neighbour and regulation preserving dynamics, making it the\nde facto standard approach to the problem. However, Van Ham's method has\nseveral drawbacks: most notably, it introduces vast regions of \"non-admissible\"\nstates that have no counterpart in the multilevel, original model. This raises\nspecial difficulties for the analysis of interaction between variables and\ncircuit functionality, which is believed to be central to the understanding of\ndynamic properties of logical models. Here, we propose a new multilevel to\nBoolean conversion method, with software implementation. Contrary to Van Ham's,\nour method doesn't yield a one-to-one transposition of multilevel trajectories,\nhowever, it maps each and every Boolean state to a specific multilevel state,\nthus getting rid of the non-admissible regions and, at the expense of\n(apparently) more complicated, \"parallel\" trajectories. One of the prominent\nfeatures of our method is that it preserves dynamics and interaction of\nvariables in a certain manner. As a demonstration of the usability of our\nmethod, we apply it to construct a new Boolean counter-example to the\nwell-known conjecture that a local negative circuit is necessary to generate\nsustained oscillations.

Human amylin oligomerizes easily and can deposit in the pancreas,\nbrain, and heart, where they have been associated with calcium dysregulation.\nIn the heart, accumulating evidence suggests that human amylin oligomers form\nmodestly cation-selective, voltage-dependent ion channels that embed in the\ncell sarcolemma (SL). The oligomers increase membrane conductance in a\ndose-dependent manner, which is correlated with elevated cytosolic calcium\n(Ca2+). Our core hypothesis therefore is that non-selective inward Ca2+\nconduction afforded by human amylin oligomers increase cytosolic and\nsarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, which thereby magnifies intracellular\nCa2+ transients. Questions remain however regarding the mechanism of\namylin-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, including whether enhanced SL Ca2+ influx is\nsufficient to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ load, and if so, how might amplified Ca2+\ntransients perturb Ca2+-dependent cardiac pathways. To investigate these\nquestions, we modified a computational model of cardiomyocytes Ca2+ signaling\nto reflect experimentally-measured changes in SL membrane permeation and\ndecreased Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) function\nstemming from acute and transgenic human amylin peptide exposure. With this\nmodel, we confirmed the hypothesis that increasing SL permeation alone was\nsufficient to enhance Ca2+ transient amplitudes. Our model indicated that\namplified cytosolic transients are driven by increased Ca2+ loading of the\nsarcoplasmic reticulum and may contribute to the Ca2+-dependent activation of\ncalmodulin. These findings suggest that increased membrane permeation induced\nby deposition of amylin oligomers contributes to Ca2+ dysregulation in\npre-diabetes.\n",

The state\nvariables in the model are the concentrations of phosphorylation states of the\nT cell receptor complex and the phosphatase SHP-1 in the cell. It is shown that\nthese quantities cannot approach zero and that the model possesses more than\none positive steady state for certain values of the parameters. It can also\nexhibit damped oscillations. It is proved that the chemical concentration which\nrepresents the degree of activation of the cell, that of the maximally\nphosphorylated form of the T cell receptor complex, is in general a\nnon-monotone function of the activating signal. In particular there are cases\nwhere there is a value of the dissociation constant of the ligand from the\nreceptor which produces an optimal activation of the T cell. In this way the\nresults of certain simulations in the literature have been confirmed rigorously\nand some important features which had not previously been seen have been\ndiscovered.\n",

They normally operate at low copy numbers and\nin spatial settings, but this is often ignored and well-stirred conditions are\nassumed. Yet, it is increasingly becoming clear that even microscopic spatial\ninhomogeneities oftentimes can induce significant differences on the\nmacroscopic level. Since experimental observation of single-molecule behavior\nis extremely challenging, theoretical modeling of biochemical reactions on the\nsingle-particle level is an important tool for understanding spatial effects in\nbiochemical systems. While purely analytical models quickly become intractable\nhere, spatial-stochastic simulations can capture a wide range of biochemical\nprocesses with the necessary levels of detail. Here we discuss different\ntechniques for spatial-stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems, and\nexplain important precautions required to make them biochemically accurate and\nefficient. We illustrate non-negligible accuracy issues arising even in the\nmost simple approaches to biochemical simulation, and present methods to deal\nwith them. We first explain how Brownian Dynamics, a widely used particle-based\ndiffusion simulation technique with fixed propagation time, can be adapted to\nincorporate chemical reactions, and portray a range of schemes that elaborate\non this idea. We then introduce event-driven spatial-stochastic simulation\nmethods, in which system updates are performed asynchronously with\nsituation-dependent, varying time steps; here we particularly focus on eGFRD, a\ncomputationally efficient particle-based algorithm that makes use of analytical\nfunctions to accurately sample interparticle reactions and diffusive motion\nwith large jumps in time and space.

The metric of net synergy, conceived as the difference between\nsynergistic and redundant information, is capable of detecting synergy,\nredundancy and, information independence among stochastic variables. And it can\nbe quantified, as it is done here, using appropriate combinations of different\nShannon mutual information terms. Utilisation of such a metric in network\nmotifs with the nodes representing different biochemical species, involved in\ninformation sharing, uncovers rich store for interesting results. In the\ncurrent study, we make use of this formalism to obtain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the relative information processing mechanism in a diamond\nmotif and two of its sub-motifs namely bifurcation and integration motif\nembedded within the diamond motif. The emerging patterns of synergy and\nredundancy and their effective contribution towards ensuring high fidelity\ninformation transmission are duly compared in the sub-motifs and independent\nmotifs (bifurcation and integration). In this context, the crucial roles played\nby various time scales and activation coefficients in the network topologies\nare especially emphasised.

We investigate this question using a first-passage-time\napproach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance\nthreshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a\ndiminishing repressor. We find that the optimal strategy corresponds to a\nnonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time. Optimality\narises from a tradeoff between minimizing the extrinsic timing noise of the\nregulator, and minimizing the intrinsic timing noise of the target molecule\nitself. Although either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated\nstrategy, when we consider the effects of cell division, we find that\nrepression outperforms activation if division occurs late in the process. Our\nresults explain the nonlinear increase and low noise of mig-1 gene expression\nin migrating neuroblast cells during Caenorhabditis elegans development, and\nsuggest that mig-1 regulation is dominated by repression for maximal temporal\nprecision.

In\naddition, we guarantee the performance of MPGM under certain classes of network\nmodels. We introduce a sampling-based stochastic model for generating k\ncorrelated networks.

Because of the abundance of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in the cell,\ndifferent species will promiscuously associate with each other, suggesting\ncollective dynamics similar to artificial neural networks. Here we present a\nsimple mechanism allowing ncRNA to perform computations equivalent to neural\nnetwork algorithms such as Boltzmann machines and the Hopfield model. The\nquantities analogous to the neural couplings are the equilibrium constants\nbetween different RNA species. The relatively rapid equilibration of RNA\nbinding and unbinding is regulated by a slower process that degrades and\ncreates new RNA. The model requires that the creation rate for each species be\nan increasing function of the ratio of total to unbound RNA. Similar mechanisms\nhave already been found to exist experimentally for ncRNA regulation. With the\noverall concentration of RNA regulated, equilibrium constants can be chosen to\nstore many different patterns, or many different input-output relations. The\nnetwork is also quite insensitive to random mutations in equilibrium constants.\nTherefore one expects that this kind of mechanism will have a much higher\nmutation rate than ones typically regarded as being under evolutionary\nconstraint.\n",

We used\nnetwork biology techniques to quantitatively assess the impact of environmental\ncontaminants on the human interactome and diseases with a particular focus on\nseven major contaminant categories: persistent organic pollutants (POPs),\ndioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides,\nperfluorochemicals (PFCs), metals, and pharmaceutical and personal care\nproducts (PPCPs). We integrated publicly available data on toxicogenomics, the\ndiseasome, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and gene essentiality and found\nthat a few contaminants were targeted to many genes, and a few genes were\ntargeted by many contaminants. The contaminant targets were hub proteins in the\nhuman PPI network, whereas the target proteins in most categories did not\ncontain abundant essential proteins. Generally, contaminant targets and\ndisease-associated proteins were closely associated with the PPI network, and\nthe closeness of the associations depended on the disease type and chemical\ncategory.

Under sufficiently slow dynamics, the dependency of the\nnon-stationary solutions on the initial state of the cells can lead to what we\ndenote here as transient hysteresis.

The major challenge\ntowards reducing such models is providing the guarantees as to how the solution\nof the reduced model relates to that of the original model, while avoiding to\nsolve the original model. In this paper, we have designed and tested an\napproximation method for ODE models of biochemical reaction systems, in which\nthe guarantees are our major requirement. Borrowing from tropical analysis\ntechniques, dominance relations among terms of each species' ODE are exploited\nto simplify the original model, by neglecting the dominated terms. As the\ndominant subsystems can change during the system's dynamics, depending on which\nspecies dominate the others, several possible modes exist. Thus, simpler models\nconsisting of only the dominant subsystems can be assembled into hybrid,\npiecewise smooth models, which approximate the behavior of the initial system.\nBy combining the detection of dominated terms with symbolic bounds propagation,\nwe show how to approximate the original model by an assembly of simpler models,\nconsisting in ordinary differential equations that provide time-dependent lower\nand upper bounds for the concentrations of the initial models species. Our\nmethod provides sound interval bounds for the concentrations of the chemical\nspecies, and hence can serve to evaluate the faithfulness of\ntropicalization-based reduction heuristics for ODE models of biochemical\nreduction systems.

In both cases, cells can raise their\nsensitivity to new external information in epochs of frequent challenging\nstress, much like a Kalman filter with adaptive gain in signal processing. Our\nwork suggests a new class of experiments that probe the history-dependence of\nenvironmental sensitivity in biophysical sensing mechanisms.\n",

Synthetic Biology exploits gene\nor/and protein regulatory networks towards the design of oscillatory networks\nfor producing useful compounds. Therefore, at different levels of application\nand for different purposes, the study of biomolecular oscillations can lead to\ndifferent clues about the mechanisms underlying living cells. It is known that\nnetwork-level interactions involve more than one type of biomolecule as well as\nbiological processes operating at multiple omic levels. Combining\nnetwork/pathway-level information with genetic information it is possible to\ndescribe well-understood or unknown bacterial mechanisms and organism-specific\ndynamics. Results: Network multi-omic integration has led to the discovery of\ninteresting oscillatory signals. Following the methodologies used in signal\nprocessing and communication engineering, a new methodology is introduced to\nidentify and quantify the extent of the multi-omic oscillations of the signal.\nNew signal metrics are designed to allow further biotechnological explanations\nand provide important clues about the oscillatory nature of the pathways and\ntheir regulatory circuits. Our algorithms designed for the analysis of\nmulti-omic signals are tested and validated on 11 different bacteria for\nthousands of multi-omic signals perturbed at the network level by different\nexperimental conditions. Information on the order of genes, codon usage, gene\nexpression, and protein molecular weight is integrated at three different\nfunctional levels. Oscillations show interesting evidence that network-level\nmulti-omic signals present a synchronized response to perturbations and\nevolutionary relations along with taxa.\n",

Mutation of Huntingtin (HTT) which causes\nHuntington's disease (HD) and mutations to TP53 which is associated with\ndifferent cancers are studied as two example cases. We construct the PPIN of\nwild type and mutant proteins separately and identify the structural modules of\neach of the networks. The functional role of these modules are then assessed by\nGene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for biological processes (BPs). We find\nthat a large number of significantly enriched (p<0.0001) GO terms in mutant\nPPIN were absent in the wild type PPIN indicating the gain of BPs due to\nmutation. Similarly some of the GO terms enriched in wild type PPIN cease to\nexist in the modules of mutant PPIN, representing the loss. GO terms common in\nmodules of mutant and wild type networks indicate both loss and gain of BPs. We\nfurther assign relevant biological function(s) to each module by classifying\nthe enriched GO terms associated with it. It turns out that most of these\nbiological functions in HTT networks are already known to be altered in HD and\nthose of TP53 networks are altered in cancers. We argue that gain of BPs, and\nthe corresponding biological functions, are due to new interacting partners\nacquired by mutant proteins.

We show that in the simplest regulatory\nscenario, a lower bound on crosstalk severity can be analytically derived\nsolely from the number of (co)regulated genes and a suitable parameter that\ndescribes binding site similarity. Estimates show that crosstalk could present\na significant challenge for organisms with low-specificity TFs, such as\nmetazoans, unless they use appropriate regulation schemes. Strong cooperativity\nsubstantially decreases crosstalk, while joint regulation by activators and\nrepressors, surprisingly, does not; moreover, certain microscopic details about\npromoter architecture emerge as globally important determinants of crosstalk\nstrength. Our results suggest that crosstalk imposes a new type of global\nconstraint on the functioning and evolution of regulatory networks, which is\nqualitatively distinct from the known constraints acting at the level of\nindividual gene regulatory elements.\n",

        "summary": "  Gradient sensing underlies important biological processes including\nmorphogenesis, polarization, and cell migration. The precision of gradient\nsensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in\nthe gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of\nconcentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests\nthat precision should also increase with detector length in the direction\ntransverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the\nnoise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the\nprecision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest\ngradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason\nis that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured\nconcentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these\nmeasurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between\nthe measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We\ndemonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional\nexcitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the\nbenefit of transverse averaging. Using a REGI-based model, we compute the\noptimal two- and three-dimensional detector shapes, and argue that they are\nconsistent with the shapes of naturally occurring gradient-sensing cell\npopulations.\n",

Communication between these proteins is mediated by\nsignaling molecules which bind to receptors and induce stochastic transitions\nbetween different conformational states. Signaling is typically a cooperative\nprocess which requires the occurrence of multiple binding events so that\nreaction rates have a nonlinear dependence on the amount of signaling molecule.\nIt is this nonlinearity that endows biological signaling networks with robust\nswitch-like properties which are critical to their biological function. In this\nstudy, we investigate how the properties of these signaling systems depend on\nthe network architecture. Our main result is that these nonlinear networks\nexhibit bistability where the network activity can switch between states that\ncorrespond to a low and high activity level. We show that this bistable regime\nemerges at a critical coupling strength that is determined by the spectral\nstructure of the network. In particular, the set of nodes that correspond to\nlarge components of the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix determines\nthe onset of bistability. Above this transition, the eigenvectors of the\nadjacency matrix determine a hierarchy of clusters, defined by its spectral\nproperties, which are activated sequentially with increasing network activity.\nWe argue further that the onset of bistability occurs either continuously or\ndiscontinuously depending upon whether the leading eigenvector is localized or\ndelocalized. Finally, we show that at low network coupling stochastic\ntransitions to the active branch are also driven by the set of nodes that\ncontribute more strongly to the leading eigenvector.\n",

Given a logic-based model of pathological\nmechanisms, kali searches for therapeutic targets able to reduce the\nreachability of the attractors associated with pathological phenotypes, thus\nreducing their likeliness. kali is illustrated on an example network and used\non a biological case study. The case study is a published logic-based model of\nbladder tumorigenesis from which kali returns consistent results.

A recently developed fast, tunable genetic oscillator by Stricker et\nal.[23] has demonstrated robustness and tunability of oscillatory behavior by\ncombining positive and negative feedback loops. This oscillator combining lacI\n(negative) and araC (positive) feedback loops, was however modeled using\nmultiple layers of differential equations to capture the molecular complexity\nof regulation, in order to explain the experimentally measured oscillations. We\nhave developed a reduced model based on delay differential equations (DDEs) of\nthis dual feedback loop oscillator, that reproduces the tunability of\noscillator period and amplitude based on the concentration of the two inducers\nisopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and arabinose.

We use our reduced model to\nredesign the network by comparing the effect of asymmetry in gene expression at\nthe level of (a) DNA copy numbers and the rates of (b) mRNA translation and (c)\ndegradation. We find the minimal period of the oscillator is sensitive to DNA\ncopy number asymmetry, but translation rate asymmetry has an identical effect\nas plasmid copy numbers, while modulating the asymmetry in mRNA degradation can\nimprove the tunability of period of the oscillator, together with increased\nrobustness to replication 'noise' and influence of the host cell cycle.

We study an\nsRNA-driven feedforward loop (sFFL) where the top-tier regulator, an sRNA\n(RprA), translationally activates the target protein (RicI) directly and also,\nindirectly, via up-regulation of its transcriptional activator (RpoS/sigma^s).\nWe show that the sRNA-mediated crosstalk between the two mRNA species leads to\nmaximum target protein synthesis for low synthesis rates of RpoS-mRNA.

Determination of each cellular state, along with the\nratio of each cell type, as well as the developmental course during cell\ndifferentiation are highly regulated processes that are robust to noise and\nenvironmental perturbations throughout development. Waddington metaphorically\ndepicted this robustness as the epigenetic landscape in which the robustness of\neach cellular state is represented by each valley in the landscape. This\nrobustness is now conceptualized as an approach toward an attractor in a\ngene-expression dynamical system. However, there is still an incomplete\nunderstanding of the origin of landscape change, which is accompanied by\nbranching of valleys that corresponds to the differentiation process. Recent\nprogress in developmental biology has unveiled the molecular processes involved\nin epigenetic modification, which will be a key to understanding the nature of\nslow landscape change. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interplay between\ngene expression and epigenetic modification to robust landscape changes, known\nas homeorhesis, remains elusive. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that\ncombines epigenetic modification with gene expression dynamics driven by a\nregulatory network.

Likelihood-free\ncomputational inference techniques enable parameter inference when the\nlikelihood function for the model is intractable but the generation of many\nsample paths is feasible through stochastic simulation of the forward problem.\nThe most common likelihood-free method in systems biology is approximate\nBayesian computation that accepts parameters that result in low discrepancy\nbetween stochastic simulations and measured data. However, it can be difficult\nto assess how the accuracy of the resulting inferences are affected by the\nchoice of acceptance threshold and discrepancy function. The pseudo-marginal\napproach is an alternative likelihood-free inference method that utilises a\nMonte Carlo estimate of the likelihood function. This approach has several\nadvantages, particularly in the context of noisy, partially observed,\ntime-course data typical in biochemical reaction network studies. Specifically,\nthe pseudo-marginal approach facilitates exact inference and uncertainty\nquantification, and may be efficiently combined with particle filters for low\nvariance, high-accuracy likelihood estimation. In this review, we provide a\npractical introduction to the pseudo-marginal approach using inference for\nbiochemical reaction networks as a series of case studies. Implementations of\nkey algorithms and examples are provided using the Julia programming language;\na high performance, open source programming language for scientific computing.\n",

However, there is disagreement as to the statistical significance of\nthese motifs, and there are potential problems with standard methods for\nestimating this significance. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are a\nclass of statistical model that can overcome some of the shortcomings of\ncommonly used methods for testing the statistical significance of motifs. ERGMs\nwere first introduced into the bioinformatics literature over ten years ago but\nhave had limited application to biological networks, possibly due to the\npractical difficulty of estimating model parameters. Advances in estimation\nalgorithms now afford analysis of much larger networks in practical time. We\nillustrate the application of ERGM to both an undirected protein-protein\ninteraction (PPI) network and directed gene regulatory networks. ERGM models\nindicate over-representation of triangles in the PPI network, and confirm\nresults from previous research as to over-representation of transitive\ntriangles (feed-forward loop) in an E. coli and a yeast regulatory network.

Proteins are in turn synthesised from expressed genes, creating a\nfeedback loop of regulation. This leads to a directed bipartite network in\nwhich a link from a gene to a TF exists if the gene codes for a protein\ncontributing to the TF, and a link from a TF to a gene exists if the TF\nregulates the expression of the gene. Both genes and TFs are modelled as binary\nvariables, which indicate, respectively, whether a gene is expressed or not,\nand a TF is synthesised or not. We consider the scenario where for a TF to be\nsynthesised, all of its contributing genes must be expressed. This results in\nan ``AND'' gate logic for the dynamics of TFs. By adapting percolation theory\nto directed bipartite graphs, evolving according to the AND logic dynamics, we\nare able to determine the necessary conditions, in the network parameter space,\nunder which bipartite networks can support a multiplicity of stable gene\nexpression patterns, under noisy conditions, as required in stable cell types.\n  In particular, the analysis reveals the possibility of a bi-stability region,\nwhere the extensive percolating cluster is or is not resilient to\nperturbations. This is remarkably different from the transition observed in\nstandard percolation theory. Finally, we consider perturbations involving\nsingle node removal that mimic gene knockout experiments.

However, a dynamic\naging-specific subnetwork did not improve prediction performance compared to a\nstatic aging-specific subnetwork, despite the aging process being dynamic. This\ncould be because the dynamic subnetwork was inferred using a naive Induced\nsubgraph approach. Instead, we recently inferred a dynamic aging-specific\nsubnetwork using a methodologically more advanced notion of network propagation\n(NP), which improved upon Induced dynamic aging-specific subnetwork in a\ndifferent task, that of unsupervised analyses of the aging process. Here, we\nevaluate whether our existing NP-based dynamic subnetwork will improve upon the\ndynamic as well as static subnetwork constructed by the Induced approach in the\nconsidered task of supervised prediction of aging-related genes. The existing\nNP-based subnetwork is unweighted, i.e., it gives equal importance to each of\nthe aging-specific PPIs. Because accounting for aging-specific edge weights\nmight be important, we additionally propose a weighted NP-based dynamic\naging-specific subnetwork.

Such requirements limit the\napplicability and the adaptability of traditional proofreading schemes. Here,\nwe explore an alternative conceptual mechanism of error correction that\nachieves delays between substrate binding and subsequent product formation by\nhaving these events occur at distinct physical locations. The time taken by the\nenzyme-substrate complex to diffuse from one location to another is leveraged\nto discard wrong substrates.

In our\nwork, we introduce an alternative conceptual scheme called 'the piston model of\nproofreading' where enzyme activation through hydrolysis is replaced with\nallosteric activation achieved through mechanical work performed by a piston on\nregulatory ligands. Inspired by Feynman's ratchet and pawl mechanism, we\nconsider a mechanical engine designed to drive the piston actions powered by a\nlowering weight, whose function is analogous to that of ATP synthase in cells.\nThanks to its mechanical design, the piston model allows us to tune the 'knobs'\nof the driving engine and probe the graded changes and trade-offs between\nspeed, fidelity and energy dissipation.

Most treatments of that stochasticity employ Gaussian noise\neven though it is a priori obvious that this approximation can violate physical\nconstraints, such as the positivity of chemical concentrations. Here, we show\nthat even when such nonphysical fluctuations are rare, an exact solution of the\nGaussian model shows that the model can yield unphysical results. This is done\nin the context of a simple incoherent-feedforward model which exhibits perfect\nadaptation in the deterministic limit. We show how one can use the natural\nseparation of time scales in this model to yield an approximate model, that is\nanalytically solvable, including its dynamical response to an environmental\nchange.

The\nmechanism underlying metabolic network modularity is of great interest not only\nto researchers of basic science but also to those in fields of engineering.\nPrevious studies have suggested a theoretical model, which proposes that a\nchange in the evolutionary goal (system-specific purpose) increases network\nmodularity, and this hypothesis was supported by statistical data analysis.\nNevertheless, further investigation has uncovered additional possibilities that\nmight explain the origin of network modularity. In this work, we propose an\nevolving network model without tuning parameters to describe metabolic\nnetworks. We demonstrate, quantitatively, that metabolic network modularity can\narise from simple growth processes, independent of the change in the\nevolutionary goal. Our model is applicable to a wide range of organisms, and\nappears to suggest that metabolic network modularity can be more simply\ndetermined than previously thought. Nonetheless, our proposition does not serve\nto contradict the previous model; it strives to provide an insight from a\ndifferent angle in the ongoing efforts to understand metabolic evolution, with\nthe hope of eventually achieving the synthetic engineering of metabolic\nnetworks.\n",

In recent years however, both experimentalists and theorists\nhave begun to appreciate that cellular decision making can also be performed at\nthe level of a single protein, giving rise to the notion of protein logic. Here\nwe systematically explore protein logic using a well known statistical\nmechanical model. As an example system, we focus on receptors which bind either\none or two ligands, and their associated dimers. Notably, we find that a single\nheterodimer can realize any of the 16 possible logic gates, including the XOR\ngate, by variation of biochemical parameters. We then introduce the novel idea\nthat a set of receptors with fixed parameters can encode functionally unique\nlogic gates simply by forming different dimeric combinations. An exhaustive\nsearch reveals that the simplest set of receptors (two single-ligand receptors\nand one double-ligand receptor) can realize several different groups of three\nunique gates, a result for which the parametric analysis of single receptors\nand dimers provides a clear interpretation. Both results underscore the\nsurprising functional freedom readily available to cells at the single-protein\nlevel.\n",

Arguably, one of the most important of\nsuch coordinated responses is the one of amplification cascades, in which\nactivation of a few key-responsive transcription factors (termed master\nregulators, MRs) lead to a large series of transcriptional activation events.\nThis is so since master regulators are transcription factors controlling the\nexpression of other transcription factor molecules and so on. MRs hold a\ncentral position related to transcriptional dynamics and control of gene\nregulatory networks and are often involved in complex feedback and feedforward\nloops inducing non-trivial dynamics. Recent studies have pointed out to the\nmyocyte enhancing factor 2C (MEF2C, also known as MADS box transcription\nenhancer factor 2, polypeptide C) as being one of such master regulators\ninvolved in the pathogenesis of primary breast cancer. In this work, we perform\nan integrative genomic analysis of the transcriptional regulation activity of\nMEF2C and its target genes to evaluate to what extent are these molecules\ninducing collective responses leading to gene expression deregulation and\ncarcinogenesis. We also analyzed a number of induced dynamic responses, in\nparticular those associated with transcriptional bursts, and nonlinear\ncascading to evaluate the influence they may have in malignant phenotypes and\ncancer.\n",

        "summary": "  Background: Network propagation has been widely used for nearly 20 years to\npredict gene functions and phenotypes. Despite the popularity of this approach,\nlittle attention has been paid to the question of provenance tracing in this\ncontext, e.g., determining how much any experimental observation in the input\ncontributes to the score of every prediction.\n  Results: We design a network propagation framework with two novel components\nand apply it to predict human proteins that directly or indirectly interact\nwith SARS-CoV-2 proteins. First, we trace the provenance of each prediction to\nits experimentally validated sources, which in our case are human proteins\nexperimentally determined to interact with viral proteins. Second, we design a\ntechnique that helps to reduce the manual adjustment of parameters by users. We\nfind that for every top-ranking prediction, the highest contribution to its\nscore arises from a direct neighbor in a human protein-protein interaction\nnetwork. We further analyze these results to develop functional insights on\nSARS-CoV-2 that expand on known biology such as the connection between\nendoplasmic reticulum stress, HSPA5, and anti-clotting agents.\n  Conclusions: We examine how our provenance tracing method can be generalized\nto a broad class of network-based algorithms. We provide a useful resource for\nthe SARS-CoV-2 community that implicates many previously undocumented proteins\nwith putative functional relationships to viral infection. This resource\nincludes potential drugs that can be opportunistically repositioned to target\nthese proteins. We also discuss how our overall framework can be extended to\nother, newly-emerging viruses.\n",

Many of these strategies rely on the\nrepositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost\ncompared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new\nnetwork-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching\noff-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by\nquantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific\nproteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure\nthat prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same\nnetwork neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14\nselected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing\ngenes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic\nsimilarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs tentatively\nrepurposed to treat COVID-19. Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we\nidentified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label\ndrugs for COVID-19 treatments, as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs,\nactually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of\nputative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential\nanti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity\nvalues. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,\nand thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by\nperforming a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the\nnetwork-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect\nagainst human coronavirus infections.\n",

The master equation\nprovides the evolution of the probability distribution across the discrete\nstate space consisting of vectors of population counts for each species.\nHowever, since its exact solution is often elusive, several analytical\napproximations have been proposed. The deterministic rate equation (DRE) gives\na macroscopic approximation as a compact system of differential equations that\nestimate the average populations for each species, but it may be inaccurate in\nthe case of nonlinear interaction dynamics. Here we propose finite state\nexpansion (FSE), an analytical method mediating between the microscopic and the\nmacroscopic interpretations of a stochastic reaction network by coupling the\nmaster equation dynamics of a chosen subset of the discrete state space with\nthe mean population dynamics of the DRE. An algorithm translates a network into\nan expanded one where each discrete state is represented as a further distinct\nspecies. This translation exactly preserves the stochastic dynamics, but the\nDRE of the expanded network can be interpreted as a correction to the original\none. The effectiveness of FSE is demonstrated in models that challenge\nstate-of-the-art techniques due to intrinsic noise, multi-scale populations,\nand multi-stability.\n",

Generally, accurate\nand rapid responses are provided by simple, unidirectional networks that\nconnect inputs with outputs. Besides accuracy and speed, biological responses\nshould also be robust to environmental or intracellular noise and mutations.\nFurthermore, cells must also respond to unforeseen environmental changes that\nhave not previously been experienced, to avoid extinction prior to the\nevolutionary rewiring of their networks, which takes numerous generations. We\nhave investigated gene regulatory networks that mutually activate or inhibit,\nand have demonstrated that complex entangled networks can make appropriate\ninput-output relationships that satisfy the robust and adaptive responses\nrequired for unforeseen challenges. Such entangled networks function for sloppy\nand unreliable responses with low Hill coefficient reactions for the expression\nof each gene. To compensate for such sloppiness, several detours in the\nregulatory network exist. By taking advantage of the averaging over such\ndetours, the network shows a higher robustness to environmental and\nintracellular noise as well as to mutations in the network, when compared to\nsimple unidirectional circuits. Furthermore, the appropriate response to\nunforeseen challenges, allowing for functional outputs, is achieved as many\ngenes exhibit similar dynamic expression responses, irrespective of inputs, as\nconfirmed by applying dynamic time warping and dynamic mode decomposition. As\ncomplex entangled networks are common in gene regulatory networks and global\ngene expression responses are observed in microbial experiments, the present\nresults provide a novel design principle for cellular networks.\n",

Basal expression is\ncorrelated to the degree of chromatin loosening measured by DNA accessibility,\nand systematically leads to cellular dedifferentiation as assessed by\ntranscriptomic signatures, irrespective of the molecular and cellular tools\nused. Modeling gene network motifs formally involved in developmental\nbifurcations, reveals that the epigenetic landscapes of Waddington are\nrestructured by the level of non specific expression, such that the attractors\nof progenitor and differentiated cells can be mutually exclusive. This\nmechanism is universal and holds beyond the particular nature of the genes\ninvolved, provided the multistable circuits are correctly described with\nautonomous basal expression.

Using homology and cohomology groups to characterize the topology of\nchemical reaction networks, we can track the changes of the network topology\ninduced by the reduction through the changes in those groups. We prove that,\nwhen certain topological conditions are met, the steady-state chemical\nconcentrations and reaction rates of the reduced system are ensured to be the\nsame as those of the original system. This result holds regardless of the\nmodeling of the reactions, namely chemical kinetics, since the conditions only\ninvolve topological information. This is advantageous because the details of\nreaction kinetics and parameter values are difficult to identify in many\npractical situations. The method allows us to reduce a reaction network while\npreserving its original steady-state properties, thereby complex reaction\nsystems can be studied efficiently.

The structure\nof the autocatalytic network generates numerous regimes in state space,\ndetermined by the limiting components, while the number of growth laws can be\nmuch smaller. We also derive a growth law that accounts for the RNA polymerase\nautocatalytic cycle, which we use to explain how growth rate depends on the\ninducible expression of the rpoB and rpoC genes, which code for the RpoB and C\nprotein subunits of RNA polymerase, and how the concentration of rifampicin,\nwhich targets RNA polymerase, affects growth rate without changing the\nRNA-to-protein ratio.

In this paper we developed a $\\tau$-leaping\nmethod for computing the FPT and position in arbitrary volumes for a Brownian\nparticle governed by the Langevin equation. The $\\tau$-leaping method proposed\nhere works as follows. A sphere is inscribed within the volume of interest\n(VOI) centered at the initial particle's location. On this sphere, the FPT is\nsampled, as well as the position, which becomes the new initial position. Then,\nanother sphere, centered at this new location, is inscribed. This process\ncontinues until the sphere becomes smaller than some minimal radius\n$R_{\\text{min}}$. When this occurs, the $\\tau$-leaping switches to the\nconventional Monte Carlo, which runs until the particle either crosses the\nsurface of the VOI or finds its way to a position where a sphere of radius\n$>R_{\\text{min}}$ can be inscribed. The switching between $\\tau$-leaping and MC\ncontinues until the particle crosses the surface of the VOI. The size of this\nradius depends on the system parameters and on one's notion of accuracy: the\nlarger this radius the more accurate the $\\tau$-leaping method, but also less\nefficient. This trade off between accuracy and efficiency is discussed. For two\nVOI, the $\\tau$-leaping method is shown to be accurate and more efficient than\nMC by at least a factor of 10 and up to a factor of about 110. However, while\nMC becomes exponentially slower with increasing VOI, the efficiency of the\n$\\tau$-leaping method remains relatively unchanged. Thus, the $\\tau$-leaping\nmethod can potentially be many orders of magnitude more efficient than MC.\n",

Turning to quantitative models, we associate a regulatory network with\na Lotka-Volterra system of differential equations, defining a functor from the\ncategory of signed graphs to a category of parameterized dynamical systems. We\nextend this result from closed to open systems, demonstrating that\nLotka-Volterra dynamics respects not only inclusions and collapsings of\nregulatory networks, but also the process of building up complex regulatory\nnetworks by gluing together simpler pieces. Formally, we use the theory of\nstructured cospans to produce a lax double functor from the double category of\nopen signed graphs to that of open parameterized dynamical systems.

Using results from the literature on diffusion-influenced reactions, we\nderive an analytical expression for the lower bound on the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation. In our theory, transcription factors can perform\nmultiple rounds of 1D diffusion along the DNA and 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm\nbefore binding to the promoter. Comparing our expression for the lower bound on\nthe precision against results from Green's Function Reaction Dynamics\nsimulations shows that the theory is highly accurate under biologically\nrelevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that, to an excellent\napproximation, the promoter switches between the transcription-factor bound and\nunbound state in a Markovian fashion. This remains true even in the presence of\nsliding, i.e. with 1D diffusion along the DNA. This has two important\nimplications: (1) minimizing the noise in the promoter state is equivalent to\nminimizing the search time of transcription factors for their promoters; (2)\nthe complicated dynamics of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm and 1D diffusion\nalong the DNA can be captured in a well-stirred model by renormalizing the\npromoter association and dissociation rates, making it possible to efficiently\nsimulate the promoter dynamics using Gillespie simulations. Based on the recent\nexperimental observation that sliding can speed up the promoter search by a\nfactor of 4, our theory predicts that sliding can enhance the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation by a factor of 2.\n",

We propose an allosteric model of the multiple\nconductance states based on concerted conformational transitions of the four\nsubunits, as an iris diaphragm. Our model predicts that the thermodynamic\nbehaviour of the conductance states upon full and partial agonist stimulations\ncan be described with increased affinity of receptors as they progress to\nhigher conductance states. The model also predicts existence of AMPA receptors\nin non-liganded conductive substates. However, spontaneous openings probability\ndecreases with increasing conductances. Finally, we predict that the large\nconductance states are stabilized within the rise phase of a whole-cell EPSC in\nglutamatergic hippocampal neurons. Our model provides a mechanistic link\nbetween ligand concentration and conductance states that can explain\nthermodynamic and kinetic features of AMPA receptor gating.\n",

Network reconstruction methods should also be scalable in\nthe sense of allowing scientists from different backgrounds to efficiently\nintegrate additional data.

Our scalable network\nreconstruction method is in part based on the well-known property of gene\nexpression correlation among interacting molecules.

However, the molecular components that give\nrise to Turing patterns have remained elusive, and the small size of the\nparameter space that permits Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to\nexplain how Turing patterns could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing\npatterns can be obtained with a single ligand if the ligand-receptor\ninteraction is taken into account. Here we show that the general properties of\nligand-receptor systems result in very large Turing spaces. Thus, the\nrestriction of receptors to single cells, negative feedbacks, regulatory\ninteractions between different ligand-receptor systems, and the clustering of\nreceptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the Turing space. We further\nshow that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10/SHH network that controls lung\nbranching morphogenesis are sufficient to result in large Turing spaces. We\nconclude that the cellular restriction of receptors provides a mechanism to\nsufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to make the evolution of\nTuring patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then have further enlarged the\nTuring space.

In computational biology, it can be used to\ntransfer biological knowledge from a well-studied species to a poorly-studied\nspecies between aligned network regions. Typically, existing network aligners\nfirst compute similarities between nodes in different networks (via a node cost\nfunction) and then aim to find a high-scoring alignment (node mapping between\nthe networks) with respect to \"node conservation\", typically the total node\ncost function over all aligned nodes. Only after an alignment is constructed,\nthe existing methods evaluate its quality with respect to an alternative\nmeasure, such as \"edge conservation\". Thus, we recently aimed to directly\noptimize edge conservation while constructing an alignment, which improved\nalignment quality. Here, we approach a novel idea of maximizing both node and\nedge conservation, and we also approach this idea from a novel perspective, by\naligning optimally edges between networks first in order to improve node cost\nfunction needed to then align well nodes between the networks. In the process,\nunlike the existing measures of edge conservation that treat each conserved\nedge the same, we favor conserved edges that are topologically similar over\nconserved edges that are topologically dissimilar.

Analysis of the tens of thousands of\nfragmentation spectra produced by a typical shotgun proteomics experiment\nbegins by assigning to each observed spectrum the peptide hypothesized to be\nresponsible for generating the spectrum, typically done by searching each\nspectrum against a database of peptides. We have recently described a machine\nlearning method---Dynamic Bayesian Network for Rapid Identification of Peptides\n(DRIP)---that not only achieves state-of-the-art spectrum identification\nperformance on a variety of datasets but also provides a trainable model\ncapable of returning valuable auxiliary information regarding specific\npeptide-spectrum matches. In this work, we present two significant improvements\nto DRIP. First, we describe how to use word lattices, which are widely used in\nnatural language processing, to significantly speed up DRIP's computations. To\nour knowledge, all existing shotgun proteomics search engines compute\nindependent scores between a given observed spectrum and each possible\ncandidate peptide from the database. The key idea of the word lattice is to\nrepresent the set of candidate peptides in a single data structure, thereby\nallowing sharing of redundant computations among the different candidates. We\ndemonstrate that using lattices in conjunction with DRIP leads to speedups on\nthe order of tens across yeast and worm data sets. Second, we introduce a\nvariant of DRIP that uses a discriminative training framework, performing\nmaximum mutual entropy estimation rather than maximum likelihood estimation.\nThis modification improves DRIP's statistical power, enabling us to increase\nthe number of identified spectrum at a 1% false discovery rate on yeast and\nworm data sets.\n",

Recent advances in deep learning\nstudies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory\nwiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify\nenvironmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in\ncellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence. I connect\nthose broad concepts to testable hypotheses for bacterial uptake of B12,\nsiderophores and glycans.\n",

Our method displays greater\naccuracy and scalability. We benchmark the performance of the pipeline with\nrespect to data set size and levels of noise.

To probe the role of this\nfeedback, we consider alternative in silico signaling networks implementing\ndifferent operating principles.

Previous studies reported\ntwo negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of follicle-stimulating hormone\nreceptor (FSHR), ADX68692 and ADX68693, with differential effects on\nFSHR-mediated steroidogenesis and ovulation. In this study, we attempted to\npharmacologically profile these NAMs on the closely related\nluteinizing/chorionic gonadotropin hormone receptor (LH/CGR) with regards to\nits canonical Gs/cAMP pathway as well as \\beta-arrestin recruitment in HEK293\ncells. The NAMs effects on progesterone and testosterone production were also\nassessed in murine Leydig tumor cell line (mLTC-1). We found that both NAMs\nstrongly antagonized LH/CGR signaling in both HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells. ADX68693\nappeared more potent than ADX68692 to inhibit hCG-induced cAMP and\n\\beta-arrestin 2 in HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells whereas no significant difference\nin their efficacy on hCG-promoted \\beta-arrestin 2 recruitment. Interestingly,\ndifferential antagonism of the two NAMs on hCG-promoted steroidogenesis in\nmLTC-1 cells was observed with significant inhibition of testosterone but not\nprogesterone production. These observations suggest biased effects of the two\nNAMs on LH/CGR-dependent pathways controlling steroidogenesis, which appeared\nto be different to that previously shown on FSHR. This also illustrates the\ncomplexity of signaling pathways controlling FSHR- and LH/CGR-mediated\nsteroidogenesis, suggesting differential implication of cAMP and\n\\beta-arrestins. Together, our data demonstrate that ADX68692 and ADX68693 are\nNAMs at the LH/CGR in addition to FSHR.

We prove that, with an odd number of genes, the new model has a\nunique steady state and the system converges to this steady state or to a\nperiodic orbit. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for stability\nof steady states when the number of genes is even and conjecture a condition\nfor stability for an odd number. Finally, we derive a new rate function\ndescribing transcription that arises under more reasonable biological\nassumptions than the widely used single-step binding assumption. With this new\ntranscription-rate function, we compare the model's amplitude and period with\nthat of a model with the conventional transcription-rate function.

The other goal is to establish the master\nequation that takes into account external fluctuations that is similar to the\nmaster equation in the adiabatic approximation. The equation allows even-odd\noscillations. The reason the behaviour occurs is an underlying interference of\nPoisson and Gaussian processes.

Here, we study a\ndistinct sRNA-driven FFL (sFFL) discovered recently in Salmonella enterica.\nUnlike previously studied transcriptional FFLs (tFFL) and sRNA-mediated FFLs\n(smFFL), here the upstream regulator is an sRNA that activates the target\nprotein and its transcriptional activator. Such sFFL has not been subjected to\nrigorous analysis. We, therefore, set out to understand two aspects. First is a\nquantitative comparison of the regulatory response of sFFL with tFFL and smFFL\nusing a differential equation framework. Since the process of gene expression\nis inherently stochastic, the second objective is to find how the noise affects\nthe functionality of sFFL. We find the response of sFFLto be stronger, faster,\nand more sensitive to the initial concentration of the upstream regulator than\ntFFL and smFFL. Further, a generating function based analysis and stochastic\nsimulations lead to a non-trivial prediction that an optimal noise filtration\ncan be attained depending on the synthesis rate of the sRNA and the degradation\nrate of the transcriptional activator. We conclude that in sFFL, sRNA plays a\ncritical role not only in driving a rapid and strong response, but also a\nreliable response that depends critically on its concentration. Given the\nadvantages of sFFL brought out in this work, it should not be surprising if\nfuture work reveals their employment in different biological contexts.\n",

They\nare increasingly used with machine learning methods to predict biologically\nmeaningful interactions. While deep learning on graphs has dramatically\nadvanced the prediction prowess, current graph neural network (GNN) methods are\noptimized for prediction on the basis of direct similarity between interacting\nnodes. In biological networks, however, similarity between nodes that do not\ndirectly interact has proved incredibly useful in the last decade across a\nvariety of interaction networks. Here, we present SkipGNN, a graph neural\nnetwork approach for the prediction of molecular interactions. SkipGNN predicts\nmolecular interactions by not only aggregating information from direct\ninteractions but also from second-order interactions, which we call skip\nsimilarity. In contrast to existing GNNs, SkipGNN receives neural messages from\ntwo-hop neighbors as well as immediate neighbors in the interaction network and\nnon-linearly transforms the messages to obtain useful information for\nprediction. To inject skip similarity into a GNN, we construct a modified\nversion of the original network, called the skip graph. We then develop an\niterative fusion scheme that optimizes a GNN using both the skip graph and the\noriginal graph. Experiments on four interaction networks, including drug-drug,\ndrug-target, protein-protein, and gene-disease interactions, show that SkipGNN\nachieves superior and robust performance, outperforming existing methods by up\nto 28.8\\% of area under the precision recall curve (PR-AUC). Furthermore, we\nshow that unlike popular GNNs, SkipGNN learns biologically meaningful\nembeddings and performs especially well on noisy, incomplete interaction\nnetworks.\n",

To characterize such critical dynamics, the established 'structural\ntheory' of criticality uses automata network connectivity and node bias (to be\non or off) as tuning parameters. This parsimony in the number of parameters\nneeded sometimes leads to uncertain predictions about the dynamical regime of\nboth random and systems biology models of biochemical regulation. We derive a\nmore accurate theory of criticality by accounting for canalization, the\nexistence of redundancy that buffers automata response to inputs -- a known\nmechanism that buffers the expression of traits, keeping them close to optimal\nstates despite genetic and environmental perturbations. The new 'canalization\ntheory' of criticality is based on a measure of effective connectivity. It\ncontributes to resolving the problem of finding precise ways to design or\ncontrol network models of biochemical regulation for desired dynamical\nbehavior. Our analyses reveal that effective connectivity significantly\nimproves the prediction of critical behavior in random automata network\nensembles. We also show that the average effective connectivity of a large\nbattery of systems biology models is much lower than the connectivity of their\noriginal interaction structure. This suggests that canalization has been\nselected to dynamically reduce and homogenize the seemingly heterogeneous\nconnectivity of biochemical networks.\n",

A central tool to understand and\ncontrol their influence on metabolic networks is sensitivity analysis, which\ninvestigates how the network responds to external perturbations. We follow here\na structural approach: the analysis is based on the network stoichiometry only\nand it does not require any quantitative knowledge of the reaction rates. We\nconsider perturbations of reaction rates and metabolite concentrations, at\nequilibrium, and we investigate the responses in the network. For general\nmetabolic systems, this paper focuses on the sign of the responses, i.e.\nwhether a response is positive, negative or whether its sign depends on the\nparameters of the system. In particular, we identify and describe the\nsubnetworks that are the main players in the sign description. These\nsubnetworks are associated to certain kernel vectors of the stoichiometric\nmatrix and are thus independent from the chosen kinetics.\n",

The stochastic state transition of receptor induces the release of\nsignaling molecular, which triggers the state transition of other receptors. It\nconstructs a nonlinear sigaling network, and leads to robust switchlike\nproperties which are critical to biological function. Network architectures and\nstate transitions of receptor affect the performance of this biological\nnetwork. In this work, we perform a study of nonlinear signaling on biological\npolymorphic network by analyzing network dynamics of the Ca$^{2+}$ induced\nCa$^{2+}$ release mechanism, where fast and slow processes are involved and the\nreceptor has four conformational states. Three types of networks,\nErd\\\"os-R\\'enyi network, Watts-Strogatz network and BaraB\\'asi-Albert network,\nare considered with different parameters. The dynamics of the biological\nnetworks exhibit different patterns at different time scales. At short time\nscale, the second open state is essential to reproduce the quasi-bistable\nregime, which emerges at a critical strength of connection for all three states\ninvolved in the fast processes and disappears at another critical point. The\npattern at short time scale is not sensitive to the network architecture. At\nlong time scale, only monostable regime is observed, and difference of network\narchitectures affects the results more seriously.

From the perspective\nof chemical kinetics, autocatalysts show a regime of super-linear growth. Given\na chemical reaction network, however, it is not at all straightforward to\nidentify species that are autocatalytic in the sense that there is a\nsub-network that takes $X$ as input and produces more than one copy of $X$ as\noutput. The difficulty arises from the need to distinguish autocatalysis e.g.\nfrom the superposition of a cycle that consumes and produces equal amounts of\n$X$ and a pathway that produces $X$. To deal with this issue, a number of\ncompeting notions, such as exclusive autocatalysis and autocatalytic cycles,\nhave been introduced. A closer inspection of concepts and their usage by\ndifferent authors shows, however, that subtle differences in the definitions\noften makes conceptually matching ideas difficult to bring together formally.\nIn this contribution we make some of the available approaches comparable by\ntranslating them into a common formal framework that uses integer hyperflows as\na basis to study autocatalysis in large chemical reaction networks.

But we have little understanding, at the local level,\nof which logics are biologically preferred or even permitted. To solve this\npuzzle, we studied the consequences of a fundamental aspect of gene regulatory\nnetworks: genes and transcription factors talk to each other but not\nthemselves. Remarkably, this bipartite structure severely restricts the number\nof logical dependencies that a gene can have on other genes. We developed a\ntheory for the number of permitted logics for different regulatory building\nblocks of genes and transcription factors. We tested our predictions against a\nsimulation of the 19 simplest building blocks, and found complete agreement.\nThe restricted range of biological logics is a key insight into how information\nis processed at the genetic level. It constraints global network function and\nmakes it easier to reverse engineer regulatory networks from observed behavior.\n",

The presence of\nthese circuits in complex networks are directed related to the phenomenon of\ncluster synchronization, which produces patterns of synchronized group of\nnodes. Here we present a fast, and memory efficient, algorithm to identify\nfibration symmetries over information-processing networks. This algorithm is\nspecially suitable for large and sparse networks since it has runtime of\ncomplexity $O(M\\log N)$ and requires $O(M+N)$ of memory resources, where $N$\nand $M$ are the number of nodes and edges in the network, respectively. We\npropose a modification on the so-called refinement paradigm to identify\ncircuits symmetrical to information flow (i.e., fibers) by finding the coarsest\nrefinement partition over the network. Finally, we show that the presented\nalgorithm provides an optimal procedure for identifying fibers, overcoming the\ncurrent approaches used in the literature.\n",

However, analogous equilibrium models do not perform\nas well in eukaryotes, most likely due to the largely out-of-equilibrium nature\nof eukaryotic regulatory processes. These processes come with unavoidable\nenergy expenditure at the molecular level to support precise, reliable, or fast\ngene expression responses that could correspond to evolutionarily optimized\nregulatory strategies. Unfortunately, the space of possible non-equilibrium\nmechanisms is vast and predominantly uninteresting. The key question is\ntherefore how this space can be navigated efficiently, to focus on mechanisms\nand models that are biologically relevant. In this review, we advocate for the\nnormative role of theory - theory that prescribes rather than just describes -\nin providing such a focus. Theory should expand its remit beyond inferring\nmodels from data (by fitting), towards identifying non-equilibrium gene\nregulatory schemes (by optimizing) that may have been evolutionarily selected\ndue to their favorable functional characteristics which outperform regulation\nat equilibrium. This approach can help us navigate the expanding complexity of\nregulatory architectures, and refocus the questions about the observed\nbiological mechanisms from how they work towards why they have evolved in the\nfirst place. We illustrate our reasoning by toy examples for which we provide\nsimulation code.\n",

There is increasing evidence that\nt physical effects, such as molecular crowding or excluded volume effects of\ntranscriptional-translational machinery, affect the yield of reaction products.\nOn the other hand, transcriptional feedback that controls gene expression\nduring mRNA synthesis is also a vital mechanism that regulates protein\nsynthesis in cells. However, the excluded volume effect of spatial constraints\non feedback regulation is not well understood. Here, we study the confinement\neffect on transcriptional autoregulatory feedbacks of gene expression reactions\nusing a theoretical model. The excluded volume effects between molecules and\nthe membrane interface suppress the gene expression in a small cell-sized\ncompartment. We find that negative feedback regulation at the transcription\nstep mitigates this size-induced gene repression and alters the scaling\nrelation of gene expression level on compartment volume, approaching the\nregular scaling relation without the steric effect. This recovery of regular\nsize-scaling of gene expression does not appear in positive feedback\nregulation, suggesting that negative autoregulatory feedback is crucial for\nmaintaining reaction products constant regardless of compartment size in\nheterogeneous cell populations.\n",

Yet, this difference is greater in the essential network\nregarding the frequency as well as the energy of triads. Additionally, results\ndemonstrate that triads in the essential gene network are more interconnected\nthrough sharing common links, while in the nonessential network they tend to be\nisolated.

Nevertheless, previous studies often simply compared if CDR3beta\nsequences were equal, while network theory studies were usually limited to\nseveral thousand sequences due to the high computational effort of constructing\nthe network. To overcome that hurdle, we introduce the GPU-based algorithm\nTCR-NET to construct large-scale CDR3beta similarity networks using\nmodel-generated and empirical sequence data with up to 800,000 CDR3beta\nsequences on a normal computer for the first time. Using network analysis\nmethods we study the structural properties of these networks and conclude that\n(i) the fraction of public TCRs depends on the size of the TCR repertoire,\nalong with the exact (not unified) definition of \"public\" sequences, (ii) the\nTCR network is assortative with the average neighbor degree being proportional\nto the squareroot of the degree of a node and (iii) the repertoire is robust\nagainst losses of TCRs. Moreover, we analyze the networks of antigen-specific\nTCRs for different antigen families and find differing clustering coefficients\nand assortativities. TCR-NET offers better access to assess large-scale TCR\nrepertoire networks, opening the possibility to quantify their structure and\nquantitatively distinguish their ability to react to antigens, which we\nanticipate to become a useful tool in a time of increasingly large amounts of\nrepertoire sequencing data becoming available.\n",

However, this two-step procedure ignores uncertainty in the\nclustering step and thus could lead to inaccurate estimation of the networks.\nTo address this problem, we propose to model scRNA-seq by the mixture\nmultivariate Poisson log-normal (MPLN) distribution. The precision matrices of\nthe MPLN are the GRNs of different cell types and can be jointly estimated by\nmaximizing MPLN's lasso-penalized log-likelihood. We show that the MPLN model\nis identifiable and the resulting penalized log-likelihood estimator is\nconsistent. To avoid the intractable optimization of the MPLN's log-likelihood,\nwe develop an algorithm called VMPLN based on the variational inference method.\nComprehensive simulation and real scRNA-seq data analyses reveal that VMPLN\nperforms better than the state-of-the-art single cell GRN methods.\n",

This study numerically and analytically investigated a\ncoupled system of a circadian clock and its output system, and then compared\nthe fluctuations in the oscillation period of the two systems.

Mathematical models of\nreceptor-ligand systems have been developed to compute a dose-response curve\nunder the assumption that the biological effect is proportional to the number\nof ligand-bound receptors. Given a dose-response curve, two quantities (or\nmetrics) have been defined to characterise the properties of the\nligand-receptor system under consideration: amplitude and potency (or\nhalf-maximal effective concentration, and denoted by EC$_{50}$). Both the\namplitude and the EC$_{50}$ are key quantities commonly used in\npharmaco-dynamic modelling, yet a comprehensive mathematical investigation of\nthe behaviour of these two metrics is still outstanding; for a large (and\nimportant) family of receptors, called cytokine receptors, we still do not know\nhow amplitude and EC$_{50}$ depend on receptor copy numbers.

Our research goal is to show how directing the mechanical signaling\ninside protein molecules using THz signals can control changes in their\nstructure and activate associated biochemical and biomechanical events. To\nestablish that, we formulate a selectivity metric that quantifies the system\nperformance and captures the capability of the nanoantenna to induce a\nconformational change in the desired protein molecule/population. The metric\nprovides a score between -1 and 1 that indicates the degree of control we have\nover the system to achieve targeted protein interactions. To develop the\nselectivity measure, we first use the Langevin stochastic equation driven by an\nexternal force to model the protein behavior. We then determine the probability\nof protein folding by computing the steady-state energy of the driven protein\nand then generalize our model to account for protein populations. Our numerical\nanalysis results indicate that a maximum selectivity score is attained when\nonly the targeted population experiences a folding behavior due to the\nimpinging THz signal. From the achieved selectivity values, we conclude that\nthe system response not only depends on the resonant frequency but also on the\nsystem controlling parameters namely, the nanoantenna force, the damping\nconstant, and the abundance of each protein population.

Robust perfect adaptation (RPA) is a property of\na system that generates an output at a fixed level even after fluctuations in\ninput stimulus without fine-tuning parameters, and it is important to\nunderstand how this feature is implemented through biochemical networks. The\nexisting literature has mainly focused on RPA of the concentration of a chosen\nchemical species, and no generic analysis has been made on RPA of reaction\nfluxes, that play an equally important role. Here, we identify structural\nconditions on reaction networks under which all the reaction fluxes exhibit RPA\nagainst the perturbation of the parameters inside a subnetwork. Based on this\nunderstanding, we give a recipe for obtaining a simpler reaction network, from\nwhich we can fully recover the steady-state reaction fluxes of the original\nsystem. This helps us identify key parameters that determine the fluxes and\nstudy the properties of complex reaction networks using a smaller one without\nlosing any information about steady-state reaction fluxes.\n",

In this work, we aim to fill this gap by\napplying structural controllability analysis of complex networks to several\nUnfolded Protein Response networks to identify crucial nodes in the signaling\nflow. In particular, we first build different network models of the Unfolded\nProtein Response mechanism, relying on data contained in various\nprotein-protein interaction databases.

Our\nstructural controllability analysis results show that the driver nodes commonly\nidentified across databases match with known endoplasmic reticulum stress\nsensors. This potentially confirms that the theoretically identified drivers\ncorrespond to the biological key proteins associated with fundamental cellular\nactivities and diseases. In conclusion, we prove that structural\ncontrollability is a reliable quantitative tool to investigate biological\nsignaling pathways, and it can be potentially applied to networks more complex\nand less explored than Unfolded Protein Response.\n",

In this work, we present a novel regression-loss based\ninverse Jacobian algorithm and related workflow COVRECON.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs), as a class of deep learning\nmodels, have emerged as a useful tool to infer gene regulatory relationships\nfrom gene expression data. However, deep learning models have been found to be\nvulnerable to noise, which greatly hinders the adoption of deep learning in\nconstructing GRNs, because high noise is often unavoidable in the process of\ngene expression measurement. Can we preferably prototype a robust GNN for\nconstructing GRNs? In this paper, we give a positive answer by proposing a\nQuadratic Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) with a dual attention mechanism. We\nstudy the changes in the predictive accuracy of Q-GAT and 9 state-of-the-art\nbaselines by introducing different levels of adversarial perturbations.\nExperiments in the E. coli and S. cerevisiae datasets suggest that Q-GAT\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models in robustness.

The former informs that nonlinear aggregation of quadratic neurons\ncan amplify useful signals and suppress unwanted noise, thereby facilitating\nrobustness, while the latter reveals that Q-GAT can leverage more features in\nprediction thanks to the dual attention mechanism, which endows Q-GAT with the\nability to confront adversarial perturbation.

Here we\naddress this issue by formalizing the existing concept of pathway modules,\nwhich are sequences of state updates that are guaranteed to occur (barring\noutside interference) in the dynamics of automata networks after the\nperturbation of a subset of driver nodes. We present a novel algorithm to\nautomatically extract pathway modules from networks and we characterize the\ninteractions that may take place between modules. This methodology uses only\nthe causal logic of individual node variables (micro-dynamics) without the need\nto compute the dynamical landscape of the networks (macro-dynamics).\nSpecifically, we identify complex modules, which maximize pathway length and\nrequire synergy between their components. This allows us to propose a new take\non dynamical modularity that partitions complex networks into causal pathways\nof variables that are guaranteed to transition to specific states given a\nperturbation to a set of driver nodes. Thus, the same node variable can take\npart in distinct modules depending on the state it takes. Our measure of\ndynamical modularity of a network is then inversely proportional to the overlap\namong complex modules and maximal when complex modules are completely\ndecouplable from one another in the network dynamics. We estimate dynamical\nmodularity for several genetic regulatory networks, including the Drosophila\nmelanogaster segment-polarity network. We discuss how identifying complex\nmodules and the dynamical modularity portrait of networks explains the\nmacro-dynamics of biological networks, such as uncovering the (more or less)\ndecouplable building blocks of emergent computation (or collective behavior) in\nbiochemical regulation and signaling.\n",

The interplay between chemical and compartmental dynamics\ncan drive rich and complex dynamical behaviors that are difficult to analyse\nmathematically -- especially in the presence of stochasticity. We have recently\nproposed an effective moment equation approach to study the statistical\nproperties of compartmentalised biochemical systems. So far, however, this\napproach is limited to polynomial rate laws and moreover, it relies on suitable\nmoment closure approximations, which can be difficult to find in practice. In\nthis work we propose a systematic method to derive closed moment dynamics for\ncompartmentalised biochemical systems. We show that for the considered class of\nsystems, the moment equations involve expectations over functions that\nfactorize into two parts, one depending on the molecular content of the\ncompartments and one depending on the compartment number distribution. Our\nmethod exploits this structure and approximates each function with suitable\npolynomial expansions, leading to a closed system of moment equations. We\ndemonstrate the method using three systems inspired by cell populations and\norganelle networks and study its accuracy across different dynamical regimes.\n",

Sequential distributive double\nphosphorylation has been extensively studied and an inequality involving only\nthe catalytic constants of kinase and phosphatase is known to be sufficient for\nmultistationarity. As multistationarity is necessary for bistability it has\nbeen argued that these constants enable bistability.\n  Here we show for cyclic distributive double phosphorylation that if its\ncatalytic constants satisfy the very same inequality, then Hopf bifurcations\nand hence sustained oscillations can occur. Hence we argue that in distributive\ndouble phosphorylation (sequential or distributive) the catalytic constants\nenable non-trivial dynamics.\n  In fact, if the rate constant values in a network of cyclic distributive\ndouble phosphorylation are such that Hopf bifurcations and sustained\noscillations can occur, then a network of sequential distributive double\nphosphorylation with the same rate constant values will show multistationarity\n-- albeit for different values of the total concentrations.

Compared to other methods for predicting the essentiality of\nlncRNA genes, our DeepHEN model not only tells whether sequence features or\nnetwork spatial features have a greater influence on essentiality but also\naddresses the overfitting issue of those methods caused by the low number of\nessential lncRNA genes, as evidenced by the results of enrichment analysis.\n",

In order\nto improve the accuracy of the identification of essential proteins,\nresearchers attempted to obtain a refined PIN by combining multiple biological\ninformation to filter out some unreliable interactions in the PIN.\nUnfortunately, such approaches drastically reduce the number of nodes in the\nPIN after multiple refinements and result in a sparser PIN. It makes a\nconsiderable portion of essential proteins unidentifiable. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-layer refined network (MR-PIN) that addresses this problem.\nFirstly, four refined networks are constructed by respectively integrating\ndifferent biological information into the static PIN to form a multi-layer\nheterogeneous network. Then scores of proteins in each network layer are\ncalculated by the existing node ranking method, and the importance score of a\nprotein in the MR-PIN is evaluated in terms of the geometric mean of its scores\nin all layers. Finally, all nodes are sorted by their importance scores to\ndetermine their essentiality. To evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-layer\nrefined network model, we apply 16 node ranking methods on the MR-PIN, and\ncompare the results with those on the SPIN, DPIN and RDPIN. Then the predictive\nperformances of these ranking methods are validated in terms of the\nidentification number of essential protein at top100 - top600, sensitivity,\nspecificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F-measure,\naccuracy, Jackknife, ROCAUC and PRAUC.

The limitations of these approaches are well understood, and\nefforts to overcome those issues so far have been plentiful but with limited\nsuccess. The known issues can be summarised as the sole dependent relation with\nsubstrate concentration, the encapsulation of rate in a single relevant scalar,\nand the subsequent lack of functional control that results from this\nassumption. The Rate Control of Chaos (RCC) is a nonlinear control method that\nhas been shown to be effective in controlling the dynamic state of biological\noscillators based on the concept of rate limitation of the exponential growth\nin chaotic systems. Extending RCC with allosteric properties allows robust\ncontrol of the enzymatic process, and replicates the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\nThe emergent dynamics is robust to perturbations and noise but susceptible to\nregulatory adjustments. This control method adapts the control parameters\ndynamically in the presence of a ligand, and permits introduction of energy\nrelations into the control function. The dynamic nature of the control\neliminates the steady-state requirements and allows the modelling of\nlarge-scale dynamic behaviour, potentially addressing issues in metabolic\ndisorder and failure of metabolic control.\n",

Yet,\nit is unclear whether there is any common feature among different systems that\nexhibit TC. From a general timescale invariance, we show that TC relies on\nexistence of certain period-lengthening reactions wherein the period of the\nsystem increases strongly with the rates in these reactions. By studying\nseveral generic oscillator models, we show that this counter-intuitive\ndependence is nonetheless a common feature of oscillators in the nonlinear\n(far-from-onset) regime where the oscillation can be separated into fast and\nslow phases. The increase of the period with the period-lengthening reaction\nrates occurs when the amplitude of the slow phase in the oscillation increases\nwith these rates while the progression-speed in the slow phase is controlled by\nother rates of the system. The positive dependence of the period on the\nperiod-lengthening rates balances its inverse dependence on other kinetic rates\nin the system, which gives rise to robust TC in a wide range of parameters. We\ndemonstrate the existence of such period-lengthening reactions and their\nrelevance for TC in all four model systems we considered. Theoretical results\nfor a model of the Kai system are supported by experimental data. A study of\nthe energy dissipation also shows that better TC performance requires higher\nenergy consumption.

This\nmotivates the search for structural and dynamical features that evolution has\nincorporated in biological networks. A recent meta-analysis of published,\nexpert-curated Boolean biological network models has revealed several such\nfeatures, often referred to as design principles. Among others, the biological\nnetworks are enriched for certain recurring network motifs, the dynamic update\nrules are more redundant, more biased and more canalizing than expected, and\nthe dynamics of biological networks are better approximable by linear and\nlower-order approximations than those of comparable random networks. Since most\nof these features are interrelated, it is paramount to disentangle cause and\neffect, that is, to understand which features evolution actively selects for,\nand thus truly constitute evolutionary design principles. Here, we show that\napproximability is strongly dependent on the dynamical robustness of a network,\nand that increased canalization in biological networks can almost completely\nexplain their recently postulated high approximability.\n",

This\nmetabolic shift, known as the Warburg effect, is pivotal in fuelling cancer's\nuncontrolled growth, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. While dysregulation\nof many genes contributes to this metabolic shift, the tumour suppressor gene\np53 emerges as a master player. Yet, the molecular mechanisms remain elusive.\nThis study introduces a comprehensive mathematical model, integrating essential\np53 targets, offering insights into how p53 orchestrates its targets to\nredirect cancer metabolism towards an OXPHOS-dominant state. Simulation\noutcomes align closely with experimental data comparing glucose metabolism in\ncolon cancer cells with wild-type and mutated p53.

Traditionally,\nresearch has focused on the duplication of gene sequences (Zhang, 1914).\nHowever, evidence suggests that the duplication of regulatory elements may also\nplay a significant role in the evolution of genomic functions (Teichmann and\nBabu, 2004; Hallin and Landry, 2019). In this work, the evolution of regulatory\nrelationships belonging to gene-specific-substructures in a GRN are modeled. In\nthe model, a network grows from an initial configuration by repeatedly choosing\na random gene to duplicate. The likelihood that the regulatory relationships\nassociated with the selected gene are retained through duplication is\ndetermined by a vector of probabilities. Occurrences of gene-family-specific\nsubstructures are counted under the gene duplication model. In this thesis,\ngene-family-specific substructures are referred to as subnetwork motifs. These\nsubnetwork motifs are motivated by network motifs which are patterns of\ninterconnections that recur more often in a specialized network than in a\nrandom network (Milo et al., 2002). Subnetwork motifs differ from network\nmotifs in the way that subnetwork motifs are instances of gene-family-specific\nsubstructures while network motifs are isomorphic substructures. These\nsubnetwork motifs are counted under Full and Partial Duplication, which differ\nin the way in which regulation relationships are inherited. Full duplication\noccurs when all regulatory links are inherited at each duplication step, and\nPartial Duplication occurs when regulation inheritance varies at each\nduplication step. Moments for the number of occurrences of subnetwork motifs\nare determined in each model. The results presented offer a method for\ndiscovering subnetwork motifs that are significant in a GRN under gene\nduplication.\n",

One\nunderstudied putative mechanism for canalization is the functional equivalence\nof a biomolecular entity's regulators (e.g., among the transcription factors\nfor a gene). In these discrete dynamical systems, activation and inhibition of\nbiomolecular entities (e.g., transcription of genes) are modeled as the\nactivity of coupled 2-state automata, and thus the equivalence of regulators\ncan be studied using the theory of symmetry in discrete functions. To this end,\nwe present a new exact algorithm for finding maximal symmetry groups among the\ninputs to discrete functions. We implement this algorithm in Rust as a Python\npackage, schematodes. We include schematodes in the new CANA v1.0.0 release, an\nopen source Python library for analyzing canalization in Boolean networks,\nwhich we also present here. We compare our exact method implemented in\nschematodes to the previously published inexact method used in earlier releases\nof CANA and find that schematodes significantly outperforms the prior method\nboth in speed and accuracy. We also apply CANA v1.0.0 to study the symmetry\nproperties of regulatory function from an ensemble of experimentally-supported\nBoolean networks from the Cell Collective. Using CANA v1.0.0, we find that the\ndistribution of a previously reported symmetry parameter, $k_s/k$, is\nstatistically significantly different in the Cell Collective than in random\nautomata with the same in-degree and activation bias (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,\n$p<0.001$).

It evaluates the dissipation needed to sustain and control\nthem, discriminating the contributions from each reaction and diffusion process\nwith spatial resolution. It also reveals the role of the reaction network in\npowering and shaping these structures. We identify particular classes of\nnetworks in which diffusion processes always equilibrate within the structures,\nwhile dissipation occurs solely due to chemical reactions. The spatial\nconfigurations resulting from these processes can be derived by minimizing a\nkinetic potential, contrasting with the minimization of the thermodynamic free\nenergy in passive systems.

Boolean modelling is more\nand more used, but the description of the dynamics from two-levels components\nmay be too limited to capture certain dynamical properties. %However, in\nBoolean models, the description of the dynamics may be too limited to capture\ncertain dynamical properties. Multivalued logical models can overcome this\nlimitation by allowing more than two levels for each component. However,\nmultivaluing a Boolean model is challenging.\n  Results: We present MRBM, a method for efficiently identifying the components\nof a Boolean model to be multivalued in order to capture specific fixed-point\nreachabilities in the asynchronous dynamics. To this goal, we defined a new\nupdating scheme locating reachability properties in the most permissive\ndynamics.

Despite the complexity of\nbiochemical control networks, recent theoretical work established lower bounds\nfor stochastic fluctuations in broad classes of systems where specific reaction\nmotifs are embedded in unspecified networks with arbitrary interactions. For\nexample, a class of generalized assembly processes in which two co-regulated\nsubunits irreversibly form a complex was shown to exhibit an unavoidable\ntrade-off between assembly efficiency and subunit fluctuations: Regardless of\nrate constants and the exact details of feedback control, the subunit\nfluctuations were shown to diverge as efficiency approaches 100%.

While all reported results are\ntechnically correct their seemingly contradictory conclusions raise the\nquestion of how broadly applicable the previously reported\nefficiency-fluctuation trade-off is. Here we establish that a much broader\nclass of assembly processes than previously considered is subject to an\nefficiency-fluctuation trade-off which diverges in the high efficiency regime.\nWe find the proposed noise filtering property of efficient assembly processes\ncorresponds to a singular limit of this class of systems.

For a reaction\nnetwork $G$, the associated dynamical system is called $\\textit{disguised\ntoric}$ if it can yield a complex-balanced realization on a possibly different\nnetwork $G_1$. This concept extends the robust properties of toric systems to\nthose that are not inherently toric. In this work, we study the\n$\\textit{disguised toric locus}$ of a reaction network - i.e., the set of\npositive rate constants that make the corresponding mass-action system\ndisguised toric. Our primary focus is to compute the exact dimension of this\nlocus. We subsequently apply our results to Thomas-type and circadian clock\nmodels.\n",

The chemicals referred to in this article are those that we detect by\nthe nose and can travel through the air. These are generally known as odorants\nor volatile compounds. Method 1 involves decomposing chemicals and transmitting\ntheir formulas digitally. Method 2 embeds chemicals in water, freezes it into\nice, and transports it to the receiver, where the chemicals are extracted upon\nmelting. Method 3 transfers chemicals via water logistics, with the receiver\nextracting them from the water. Method 4 uses airtight pipelines to transport\nchemicals in water, which are then extracted by the receiver. Method 5 projects\nchemical odors into the air, where the receiver captures them using suction.\nMethod 6 draws from optical fiber technology to transmit chemical odors through\na cable, ensuring the chemical composition remains intact. Each method ensures\nthe receiver experiences the same scent as the sender.\n",

Steady states, which\ndescribe their long-term behaviors, are determined by solving $N\\cdot K(x)=0$,\nwhile complex balanced steady states are found by solving $I_a \\cdot K(x)=0$.\nTo investigate these complex networks, decomposition techniques are important,\nin particular, for computing steady states. Previously, we identified a\nwidespread property across many networks: the existence of independent and\nincidence-independent decompositions, characterized by the ability to directly\nsum the stoichiometric and incidence matrices of the subnetworks, respectively,\nto match those of the entire network. Here, we discover the ubiquitous property\nthat we call the Finest Decomposition Coarsening (FDC), where the finest\nindependent decomposition (FID) is a coarsening of the finest\nincidence-independent decomposition (FIID). To support the analysis of this\nproperty, we introduce a MATLAB package designed to compute both these\ndecompositions. We then characterize the FDC property and its relationship to\nstructural factors such as the invertibility of the molecularity matrix. We\nalso introduce and characterize the Finest Decompositions Equality (FDE)\nproperty, where FIID equals FID. Notably, we show that all deficiency zero\nnetworks exhibit the FDE property. Furthermore, we establish important\nrelationships of the FID and FIID with decomposition of the network into its\nconnected components. Our results highlight the prevalence of the coarsening\nproperty in reaction networks and deepens the understanding of the algebraic\nstructure and dynamics of biochemical networks.\n",

In particular, we consider an\nelectronic nanobiosensor based on a G-protein coupled receptor. By adopting a\ncoarse grain description, the protein is modeled as a complex network of\nelementary impedances. The positions of the alpha-carbon atoms of each amino\nacid are taken as the nodes of the network. The amino acids are assumed to\ninteract electrically among them. Consequently, a link is drawn between any\npair of nodes neighboring in space within a given distance and an elementary\nimpedance is associated with each link. The value of this impedance can be\nrelated to the physical and chemical properties of the amino acid pair and to\ntheir relative distance. Accordingly, the conformational changes of the\nreceptor induced by the capture of the ligand, are translated into a variation\nof its electrical properties. Stochastic fluctuations in the value of the\nelementary impedances of the network, which mimic different physical effects,\nhave also been considered. Preliminary results concerning the impedance\nspectrum of the network and its fluctuations are presented and discussed for\ndifferent values of the model parameters.\n",

This description of natural variability for delays\nintroduces a transition from a stable steady state to limit cycle oscillations\nand then a second transition back to a stable steady state which has not been\nobserved in previously published models. On the basis of our results and\nfollowing recent discussions about the role of delay-induced oscillations in\ngene transcription we establish the hypothesis that the period of the\ndelay-induced cyclic changes should be characterized by an upper bound so that\nit cannot be greater then the period of fundamental biological cycles. We\ndemonstrate our approach for two models. The first model describes Hes1\nautorepression with equations for Hes1 mRNA production and Hes1 protein\ntranslation. The second model describes Hes1 repression by the protein complex\nGro/TLE1/Hes1, where Gro/TLE1 is activated by Hes1 phosphorylation.\n",

We first show that many animal viruses\nmight encode feedback resistors in their regulatory circuits. Then, by using a\ncombination of mathematical theory and single-cell real-time imaging\nexperiments, we show that a feedback resistor in the HIV Tat transcriptional\ncircuit likely allows the HIV virus to enter into latency.

Genetic networks are intrinsically noisy due to natural\nrandom intra- and inter-cellular fluctuations. Therefore, it is important to\nstudy the effects of noise perturbation on the synchronous dynamics of genetic\noscillators. From the synthetic biology viewpoint, it is also important to\nimplement biological systems that minimizing the negative influence of the\nperturbations. In this paper, based on systems biology approach, we provide a\ngeneral theoretical result on the synchronization of genetic oscillators with\nstochastic perturbations. By exploiting the specific properties of many genetic\noscillator models, we provide an easy-verified sufficient condition for the\nstochastic synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators, based on the Lur'e\nsystem approach in control theory. A design principle for minimizing the\ninfluence of noise is also presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our\ntheoretical results, a population of coupled repressillators is adopted as a\nnumerical example. In summary, we present an efficient theoretical method for\nanalyzing the synchronization of genetic oscillator networks, which is helpful\nfor understanding and testing the synchronization phenomena in biological\norganisms.

This allows subgraphs with up to ten or more\nnodes to be sampled with very high statistics, from arbitrarily large networks.\nUsing this together with a heuristic algorithm for rapidly classifying\nisomorphic graphs, we present results for two protein interaction networks\nobtained using the TAP high throughput method: one of Escherichia coli with 230\nnodes and 695 links, and one for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with roughly\nten times more nodes and links. We find in both cases that most connected\nsubgraphs are strong motifs (Z-scores >10) or anti-motifs (Z-scores <-10) when\nthe null model is the ensemble of networks with fixed degree sequence. Strong\ndifferences appear between the two networks, with dominant motifs in E. coli\nbeing (nearly) bipartite graphs and having many pairs of nodes which connect to\nthe same neighbors, while dominant motifs in yeast tend towards completeness or\ncontain large cliques. We also explore a number of methods that do not rely on\nmeasurements of Z-scores or comparisons with null models. For instance, we\ndiscuss the influence of specific complexes like the 26S proteasome in yeast,\nwhere a small number of complexes dominate the $k$-cores with large k and have\na decisive effect on the strongest motifs with 6 to 8 nodes.

Many biological functions of Escherichia\ncoli metabolism can be sustained against single-gene or even multiple-gene\nmutations by using redundant or alternative pathways. Thus, only a limited\nnumber of genes have been identified to be lethal to the cell. In this regard,\nthe reaction-centric gene deletion study has a limitation in understanding the\nmetabolic robustness. Here, we report the use of flux-sum, which is the\nsummation of all incoming or outgoing fluxes around a particular metabolite\nunder pseudo-steady state conditions, as a good conserved property for\nelucidating such robustness of E. coli from the metabolite point of view. The\nfunctional behavior, as well as the structural and evolutionary properties of\nmetabolites essential to the cell survival, was investigated by means of a\nconstraints-based flux analysis under perturbed conditions. The essential\nmetabolites are capable of maintaining a steady flux-sum even against severe\nperturbation by actively redistributing the relevant fluxes.

Regulatory motifs are groups of\nnodes with the same connectivity structure, capable of processing information.\nThe bifan motif, made of two source nodes directly cross-regulating two target\nnodes, is an over-represented motif in a mammalian cell signaling network and\nin transcriptional networks. One example of a bifan is the two MAP-kinases, p38\nand JNK that phosphorylate and activate the two transcription factors ATF2 and\nElk-1. We have used a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to\nanalyze the regulatory capability of this bifan motif by itself, and when it\ninteracts with other motifs such as positive and negative feedback loops. Our\nresults indicate that bifans provide temporal regulation of signal propagation\nand act as signal sorters, filters, and synchronizers. Bifans that have OR gate\nconfigurations show rapid responses while AND gate bifans can introduce delays\nand allow prolongation of signal outputs. Bifans that are AND gates can filter\nnoisy signal inputs. The p38/JNK-ATF2/Elk-1bifan synchronizes the output of\nactivated transcription factors. Synchronization is a robust property of bifans\nand is exhibited even when the bifan is adjacent to a positive feedback loop.\nThe presence of the bifan promotes the transcription and translation of the\ndual specificity protein phosphatase MKP-1 that inhibits p38 and JNK thus\nenabling a negative feedback loop.

This clock\noperates in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), generating dynamic stripe patterns\nof oscillatory gene-expression across the field of PSM cells. How these spatial\npatterns, the clock's collective period, and the underlying cellular-level\ninteractions are related is not understood. A theory encompassing temporal and\nspatial domains of local and collective aspects of the system is essential to\ntackle these questions. Our delayed coupling theory achieves this by\nrepresenting the PSM as an array of phase oscillators, combining four key\nelements: a frequency profile of oscillators slowing across the PSM; coupling\nbetween neighboring oscillators; delay in coupling; and a moving boundary\ndescribing embryonic axis elongation. This theory predicts that the\nsegmentation clock's collective period depends on delayed coupling. We derive\nan expression for pattern wavelength across the PSM and show how this can be\nused to fit dynamic wildtype gene-expression patterns, revealing the\nquantitative values of parameters controlling spatial and temporal organization\nof the oscillators in the system. Our theory can be used to analyze\nexperimental perturbations, thereby identifying roles of genes involved in\nsegmentation.\n",

Methods commonly\nemployed are based on finding the stationary flux configurations that satisfy\nmass-balance conditions for metabolites, often coupling them to local\noptimization rules (e.g. maximization of biomass production) to reduce the size\nof the solution space to a single point. Such methods have been widely applied\nand have proven able to reproduce experimental findings for relatively simple\norganisms in specific conditions.

Glycans are involved\nin fundamental biological processes, including protein folding and clearance,\ncell proliferation and apoptosis, development, immune responses, and\npathogenesis. One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by\nsequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of\nenzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as\nsubstrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their\nintermingled pathways. Motivated by the quantitative methods developed in\ncomplex network research, we investigated the large-scale organization of such\nN-linked glycosylation pathways in mammalian cells. The N-linked glycosylation\npathways are extremely modular, and are composed of cohesive topological\nmodules that directly branch from a common upstream pathway of glycan\nsynthesis. This unique structural property allows the glycan production between\nmodules to be controlled by the upstream region. Although the enzymes act on\nmultiple glycan substrates, indicating cross-talk between modules, the impact\nof the cross-talk on the module-specific enhancement of glycan synthesis may be\nconfined within a moderate range by transcription-level control. The findings\nof the present study provide experimentally-testable predictions for\nglycosylation processes, and may be applicable to therapeutic glycoprotein\nengineering.\n",

This phenomenon is experimentally testable and\nhas an intriguing implication for biological organization and evolution, as it\namounts to \"optimization without natural selection of replicators\". Unlike the\nstatistical-mechanical approaches to self-organization, the Cf principle does\nnot encounter the problem of \"tradeoff between stability and complexity\" at the\nlevel of individual cell. Physically, the Cf is considered as a harmonic-like\nforce of reaction, which keeps the state of the cell close to the ground state,\ndefined here as a state where enzymatic acts work most efficiently. Ground\nstate is subject to unitary evolution, and serves as a starting point in a\ngeneral strategy of quantum description of intracellular processes, termed here\n\"Euclidean approach\". The next step of this strategy is transition from the\ndescription of ground state to that one of growing state, and we suggest how it\ncan be accomplished using arguments from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\nFinally, given that the most reliable and informative observable of an\nindividual cell is the sequence of its genome, we propose that the\nnon-classical correlations between individual molecular events at the single\ncell level could be easiest to detect using high throughput DNA sequencing.\n",

This raises a fundamental biophysical question: to what extent can the\nwhole-cell behavior of a large metabolic network be controlled by constraining\nthe flux of one or more reactions in the network? This touches upon the issue\nof the number of degrees of freedom contained by one such network. Using the\nmetabolic network of Escherichia coli as a model system, here we address this\nquestion theoretically by exploring not only reaction deletions, but also a\ncontinuum of all possible reaction expression levels. We show that the behavior\nof the metabolic network can be largely manipulated by the pinned expression of\na single reaction. In particular, a relevant fraction of the metabolic\nreactions exhibits canalizing interactions, in that the specification of one\nreaction flux determines cellular growth as well as the fluxes of most other\nreactions in optimal steady states. The activity of individual reactions can\nthus be used as surrogates to monitor and possibly control cellular growth and\nother whole-cell behaviors. In addition to its implications for the study of\ncontrol processes, our methodology provides a new approach to study how the\nintegrated dynamics of the entire metabolic network emerges from the\ncoordinated behavior of its component parts.\n",

A genotype is viable in a given\nenvironment if it is capable of producing all biomass components the organism\nneeds to survive and reproduce. Previous work has focused on the properties of\nindividual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic\nnetworks with a given function can vary in their reaction content. Results: We\nhere characterize spaces of such genotypes. Specifically, we study metabolic\ngenotypes whose phenotype is viability in minimal chemical environments that\ndiffer in their sole carbon sources. We show that regardless of the number of\nreactions in a metabolic genotype, the genotypes of a given phenotype typically\nform vast, connected, and unstructured sets -- genotype networks -- that nearly\nspan the whole of genotype space. The robustness of metabolic phenotypes to\nrandom reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high\nmean. Different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in\ntheir genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be\nviable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic\nreactions were used independently across different chemical environments.\nConclusions: Our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have\ngeneric organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to\nthe number of reactions in metabolic genotypes.\n",

With that in mind, this\nchapter is dedicated to the reverse-engineering of biological systems.\n  Specifically, we focus our attention on a particular class of methods for\nreverse-engineering, namely those that rely algorithmically upon the so-called\n\"hitting-set\" problem, which is a classical combinatorial and computer science\nproblem, Each of these methods utilizes a different algorithm in order to\nobtain an exact or an approximate solution of the hitting set problem. We will\nexplore the ultimate impact that the alternative algorithms have on the\ninference of published in silico biological networks.\n",

Comparison of different populations of weighted networks is hard\nbecause topology is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined\nas the number of edges in an unweighted graph. In this paper, we evaluate the\nbenefits and limitations associated with using cost-integrated topological\nmetrics. Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted undirected graphs\nusing global efficiency. We evaluate different approaches to the comparison of\nweighted networks that differ in mean association weight. Our key result shows\nthat integrating over cost is equivalent to controlling for any monotonic\ntransformation of the weight set of a weighted graph. That is, when integrating\nover cost, we eliminate the differences in topology that may be due to a\nmonotonic transformation of the weight set. Our result holds for any unweighted\ntopological measure. Cost-integration is therefore helpful in disentangling\ndifferences in cost from differences in topology. By contrast, we show that the\nuse of the weighted version of a topological metric does not constitute a valid\napproach to this problem. Indeed, we prove that, under mild conditions, the use\nof the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing\nweighted costs. Thus, we recommend the reporting of (i) differences in weighted\ncosts and (ii) differences in cost-integrated topological measures. We\ndemonstrate the application of these techniques in a re-analysis of an fMRI\nworking memory task. Finally, we discuss the limitations of integrating\ntopology over cost, which may pose problems when some weights are zero, when\nmultiplicities exist in the ranks of the weights, and when one expects subtle\ncost-dependent topological differences, which could be masked by\ncost-integration.\n",

The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of\napoptosis is governed up-stream of mitochondria, by the family of Bcl-2\nproteins, and down-stream of mitochondria, by low-probability events, such as\napoptosome formation, and by feedback circuits involving caspases and inhibitor\nof apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP. All these regulatory mechanisms\nensure that cells only commit to death once a threshold of damage has been\nreached and the anti-apoptotic reserve of the cell is overcome. As cancer cells\nare invariably exposed to strong intracellular and extracellular stress\nstimuli, they are particularly reliant on the expression of anti-apoptotic\nproteins. Hence, many cancer cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to agents\nthat inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecules, such as BH3 mimetics, while normal\ncells remain relatively insensitive to single agent treatments with the same\nclass of molecules. Targeting different proteins within the apoptotic network\nwith combinatorial treatment approaches often achieves even greater\nspecificity. This led us to investigate the sensitivity of leukemia and\nlymphoma cells to a pro-apoptotic action of a BH3 mimetic combined with a small\nmolecule inhibitor of XIAP. Using computational probabilistic model of\napoptotic pathway, verified by experimental results from human leukemia and\nlymphoma cell lines, we show that inhibition of XIAP has a non-linear effect on\nsensitization towards apoptosis induced by the BH3 mimetic HA14-1. This study\njustifies further ex vivo and animal studies on the potential of the treatment\nof leukemia and lymphoma with a combination of BH3 mimetics and XIAP\ninhibitors.\n",

S. cerevisiae is an appropriate\nmodel organism, since both its protein-protein interaction network\n(interactome) and stress response at the gene expression level have been well\ncharacterized. However, the analysis of the reorganization of the yeast\ninteractome during stress has not been investigated yet. We calculated the\nchanges of the interaction-weights of the yeast interactome from the changes of\nmRNA expression levels upon heat shock. The major finding of our study is that\nheat shock induced a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections\nof yeast interactome modules. In agreement with this the weighted diameter of\nthe yeast interactome had a 4.9-fold increase in heat shock. Several key\nproteins of the heat shock response became centers of heat shock-induced local\ncommunities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules\nafter heat shock. The observed changes resemble to a \"stratus-cumulus\" type\ntransition of the interactome structure, since the unstressed yeast interactome\nhad a globally connected organization, similar to that of stratus clouds,\nwhereas the heat shocked interactome had a multifocal organization, similar to\nthat of cumulus clouds. Our results showed that heat shock induces a partial\ndisintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome. This change\nmay be rather general occurring in many types of stresses. Moreover, other\ncomplex systems, such as single proteins, social networks and ecosystems may\nalso decrease their inter-modular links, thus develop more compact modules, and\ndisplay a partial disintegration of their global structure in the initial phase\nof crisis. Thus, our work may provide a model of a general, system-level\nadaptation mechanism to environmental changes.\n",

We show that in the\nspecial but important case of optimal-gain cascades (i.e., when the\ndeactivation rates are identical) the downstream output of the cascade can be\nrepresented exactly as a lumped nonlinear module containing an incomplete gamma\nfunction with real parameters that depend on the rates and length of the\ncascade, as well as parameters of the input signal. The expressions obtained\ncan be applied to the non-identical case when the deactivation rates are random\nto capture the variability in the cascade outputs. We also show that cascades\ncan be rearranged so that blocks with similar rates can be lumped and\nrepresented through our nonlinear modules. Our results can be used both to\nrepresent cascades in computational models of differential equations and to fit\ndata efficiently, by reducing the number of equations and parameters involved.\nIn particular, the length of the cascade appears as a real-valued parameter and\ncan thus be fitted in the same manner as Hill coefficients.

We further connected the metabolic and gene\nco-expression networks of M. pneumoniae through enzyme activities, and studied\nthe consequences of knocking out individual genes and clusters of genes. Damage\ncaused by single gene knockouts reveals a strong correlation between\ngenome-scale cascades of large impact and gene essentiality.

Mathematical modeling\nis used as a systems biology tool to answer biological questions, and more\nprecisely, to validate a network that describes biological observations and to\npredict the effect of perturbations.\n  We propose a modeling approach that is intrinsically continuous in time. The\nalgorithm presented here fills the gap between qualitative and quantitative\nmodeling. It is based on continuous time Markov process applied on a Boolean\nstate space. In order to describe the temporal evolution, we explicitly specify\nthe transition rates for each node. For that purpose, we built a language that\ncan be seen as a generalization of Boolean equations. The values of transition\nrates have a natural interpretation: it is the inverse of the time for the\ntransition to occur. Mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set\nof ordinary differential equations on probability distributions; therefore, it\ncan be seen as an approach in between quantitative and qualitative.\n  We developed a C++ software, MaBoSS, that is able to simulate such a system\nby applying Kinetic Monte-Carlo (or Gillespie algorithm) in the Boolean state\nspace. This software, parallelized and optimized, computes temporal evolution\nof probability distributions and can also estimate stationary distributions.\nApplications of Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo have been demonstrated for two\nqualitative models: a toy model and a published p53/Mdm2 model.

However, the amount of computation time required to perform\nUVCluster analyses imposed significant limitations to its use.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the suite Jerarca, designed to\nefficiently convert networks of interacting units into dendrograms by means of\niterative hierarchical clustering. Jerarca is divided into three main sections.\nFirst, weighted distances among units are computed using up to three different\napproaches: a more efficient version of UVCluster and two new, related\nalgorithms called RCluster and SCluster. Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms\nbased on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as\nUPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the\ntrees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and\nintercluster connections.

We provide a general\noverview of possible network mechanisms of adaptation, learning and memory\nformation.

Here, networks may have much less modular\nboundaries than locally rigid, highly modular networks, where the learnt\ninformation has already been consolidated in a memory formation process. Since\nmodular boundaries are efficient filters of information, in the \"learning\ncompetent\" state information filtering may be much smaller, than after memory\nformation. This mechanism restricts high information transfer to the \"learning\ncompetent\" state. After memory formation, modular boundary-induced segregation\nand information filtering protect the stored information. The flexible networks\nof young organisms are generally in a \"learning competent\" state. On the\ncontrary, locally rigid networks of old organisms have lost their \"learning\ncompetent\" state, but store and protect their learnt information efficiently.\nWe anticipate that the above mechanism may operate at the level of both\nprotein-protein interaction and neuronal networks.\n",

Different approaches are used such as deterministic\nand stochastic models, models that describe cell growth and division explicitly\nor implicitly etc. Here we consider simple systems of unregulated\n(constitutive) gene expression and compare different mathematical descriptions\nsystematically to obtain insight into the errors that are introduced by various\ncommon approximations such as describing cell growth and division by an\neffective protein degradation term. In particular, we show that the population\naverage of protein content of a cell exhibits a subtle dependence on the\ndynamics of growth and division, the specific model for volume growth and the\nage structure of the population. Nevertheless, the error made by models with\nimplicit cell growth and division is quite small. Furthermore, we compare\nvarious models that are partially stochastic to investigate the impact of\ndifferent sources of (intrinsic) noise. This comparison indicates that\ndifferent sources of noise (protein synthesis, partitioning in cell division)\ncontribute comparable amounts of noise if protein synthesis is not or only\nweakly bursty. If protein synthesis is very bursty, the burstiness is the\ndominant noise source, independent of other details of the model. Finally, we\ndiscuss two sources of extrinsic noise: cell-to-cell variations in protein\ncontent due to cells being at different stages in the division cycles, which we\nshow to be small (for the protein concentration and, surprisingly, also for the\nprotein copy number per cell) and fluctuations in the growth rate, which can\nhave a significant impact.\n",

The\nminimal regulatory designs giving rise to oscillations have been implemented\nsynthetically and studied by mathematical modeling. However, most of the\navailable analyses generally neglect the coupling of regulatory circuits with\nthe cellular \"chassis\" in which the circuits are embedded. For example, the\nintracellular macromolecular composition of fast-growing bacteria changes with\ngrowth rate. As a consequence, important parameters of gene expression, such as\nribosome concentration or cell volume, are growth-rate dependent, ultimately\ncoupling the dynamics of genetic circuits with cell physiology. This work\naddresses the effects of growth rate on the dynamics of a paradigmatic example\nof genetic oscillator, the repressilator. Making use of empirical growth-rate\ndependences of parameters in bacteria, we show that the repressilator dynamics\ncan switch between oscillations and convergence to a fixed point depending on\nthe cellular state of growth, and thus on the nutrients it is fed. The physical\nsupport of the circuit (type of plasmid or gene positions on the chromosome)\nalso plays an important role in determining the oscillation stability and the\ngrowth-rate dependence of period and amplitude. This analysis has potential\napplication in the field of synthetic biology, and suggests that the coupling\nbetween endogenous genetic oscillators and cell physiology can have substantial\nconsequences for their functionality.\n",

The information accumulated time-by-time and included in\nthe GO is encoded in the definition of terms and in the setting up of semantic\nrelations amongst terms. This approach might be usefully complemented by a\nbottom-up approach based on the knowledge of relationships amongst genes. To\nthis end, we investigate the Gene Ontology from a complex network perspective.\nWe consider the semantic network of terms naturally associated with the\nsemantic relationships provided by the Gene Ontology consortium and a\ngene-based weighted network in which the nodes are the terms and a link between\nany two terms is set up whenever genes are annotated in both terms. One aim of\nthe present paper is to understand whether the semantic and the gene-based\nnetwork share the same structural properties or not. We then consider network\ncommunities. The identification of communities in the SVNs network can\ntherefore be the basis of a simple protocol aiming at fully exploiting the\npossible relationships amongst terms, thus improving the knowledge of the\nsemantic structure of GO. This is also important from a biomedical point of\nview, as it might reveal how genes over-expressed in a certain term also affect\nother biological functions not directly linked by the GO semantics.

When DNA is damaged p53 induces the cell cycle arrest to\nprevent the transmission of the damage to cell progeny, triggers the production\nof proteins for DNA repair and ultimately calls for apoptosis. In particular,\nthe p53-Mdm2 feedback loop seems to be the key circuit in this response of\ncells to damage. For many years, based on measurements over populations of\ncells it was believed that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop was the responsible for\nthe existence of damped oscillations in the levels of p53 and Mdm2 after DNA\ndamage. However, recent measurements in individual human cells have shown that\np53 and its regulator Mdm2 develop sustained oscillations over long periods of\ntime even in the absence of stress. These results have attracted a lot of\ninterest, first because they open a new experimental framework to study the p53\nand its interactions and second because they challenge years of mathematical\nmodels with new and accurate data on single cells. Inspired by these\nexperiments standard models of the p53-Mdm2 circuit were modified introducing\nad-hoc some biologically motivated noise that becomes responsible for the\nstability of the oscillations.

The presence of a duplicate removes the constraint of natural\nselection upon the gene, leading to its likely loss of function or,\noccasionally, the gain of a novel one. Alternately, a pleiotropic gene might\npartition its functions among its duplicates, thus preserving both copies.\nDuplicate genes is not a novelty for diploid genotypes, but only for\nhaplotypes. In this paper, we study the consequences of regulatory interactions\nin diploid genotypes and explore how the context of allelic interactions gives\nrise to dynamical phenotypes that enable duplicate genes to spread in a\npopulation. The regulatory network we study is that of a single autoregulatory\nactivator gene, and the two copies of the gene diverge either as alleles in a\ndiploid species or as duplicates in haploids. These differences are in their\ntranscriptional ability -- either via alterations to its activating domain, or\nto its cis-regulatory binding repertoire. When cis-regulatory changes are\nintroduced that partition multiple regulatory triggers among the duplicates, it\nis shown that mutually exclusive expression states of the duplicates that\nemerge are accompanied by a back-up facility: when a highly expressed gene is\ndeleted, the previously unexpressed duplicate copy compensates for it. The\ndiploid version of the regulatory network model can account for allele-specific\nexpression variants, and a model of inheritance of the haplotype network\nenables us to trace the evolutionary consequence of heterozygous phenotypes.\nThis is modelled for the variations in the activating domain of one copy,\nwhereby stable as well as transiently bursting oscillations ensue in single\ncells. The evolutionary model shows that these phenotypic states accessible to\na diploid, heterozygous genotype enable the spread of a duplicated haplotype.\n",

Although a lot of progress has been made\nin developing analysis tools for these models, there is still a need to find\napproaches that can directly relate the network structure to its dynamics. Of\nspecial interest is identifying the stable patterns of activity, i.e., the\nattractors of the system. This is a problem for large networks, because the\nstate space of the system increases exponentially with network size. In this\nwork we present a novel network reduction approach that is based on finding\nnetwork motifs that stabilize in a fixed state. Notably, we use a topological\ncriterion to identify these motifs. Specifically, we find certain types of\nstrongly connected components in a suitably expanded representation of the\nnetwork. To test our method we apply it to a dynamic network model for a type\nof cytotoxic T cell cancer and to an ensemble of random Boolean networks of\nsize up to 200. Our results show that our method goes beyond reducing the\nnetwork and in most cases can actually predict the dynamical repertoire of the\nnodes (fixed states or oscillations) in the attractors of the system.\n",

Such networks are found as\nmodeling tools in many biological disciplines such as biochemistry, ecology,\nepidemiology, immunology, systems biology and synthetic biology. It is now\nwell-established that, for small population sizes, stochastic models for\nbiochemical reaction networks are necessary to capture randomness in the\ninteractions. The tools for analyzing such models, however, still lag far\nbehind their deterministic counterparts. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\ndeveloping a constructive framework for examining the long-term behavior and\nstability properties of the reaction dynamics in a stochastic setting. In\nparticular, we address the problems of determining ergodicity of the reaction\ndynamics, which is analogous to having a globally attracting fixed point for\ndeterministic dynamics. We also examine when the statistical moments of the\nunderlying process remain bounded with time and when they converge to their\nsteady state values. The framework we develop relies on a blend of ideas from\nprobability theory, linear algebra and optimization theory. We demonstrate that\nthe stability properties of a wide class of biological networks can be assessed\nfrom our sufficient theoretical conditions that can be recast as efficient and\nscalable linear programs, well-known for their tractability. It is notably\nshown that the computational complexity is often linear in the number of\nspecies. We illustrate the validity, the efficiency and the wide applicability\nof our results on several reaction networks arising in biochemistry, systems\nbiology, epidemiology and ecology. The biological implications of the results\nas well as an example of a non-ergodic biological network are also discussed.\n",

As a result, studies frequently consider the\nextent to which the topological structure of a metabolic network determines its\ndynamic behavior, irrespective of kinetic details.

We derive two new results named the\nStubborn Roots Theorems, which provide sufficient conditions under which the\nroots of S remain qualitatively identical to the roots of P.

We describe the hallmarks of\nincreased system plasticity of early, tumor initiating cells, such as increased\nnoise, entropy, conformational and phenotypic plasticity, physical\ndeformability, cell heterogeneity and network rearrangements. Finally, we argue\nthat the large structural changes of molecular networks during cancer\ndevelopment necessitate a rather different targeting strategy in early and late\nphase of carcinogenesis. Plastic networks of early phase cancer development\nneed a central hit, while rigid networks of late stage primary tumors or\nestablished metastases should be attacked by the network influence strategy,\nsuch as by edgetic, multi-target, or allo-network drugs. Cancer stem cells need\nspecial diagnosis and targeting, since their dormant and rapidly proliferating\nforms may have more rigid, or more plastic networks, respectively. The\nextremely high ability to change their rigidity/plasticity may be a key\ndifferentiating hallmark of cancer stem cells.

In\nsome cases, the complexity of the solution space can be reduced by performing\nan additional optimization, while in other cases, knowing the range of\nvariability of fluxes over the polytope provides a sufficient characterization\nof the allowed configurations. There are cases, however, in which the thorough\ninformation encoded in the individual distributions of viable fluxes over the\npolytope is required.

We have developed a large-scale, constraint-based network\nmodel of the metabolic partnership between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons\nthat allows for a quantitative appraisal of the extent to which stoichiometry\nalone drives the energetics of the system. We find that the velocity of the\nglutamate-glutamine cycle ($V_{cyc}$) explains part of the uncoupling between\nglucose and oxygen utilization at increasing $V_{cyc}$ levels. Thus, we are\nable to characterize different activation states in terms of the tissue\noxygen-glucose index (OGI). Calculations show that glucose is taken up and\nmetabolized according to cellular energy requirements, and that partitioning of\nthe sugar between different cell types is not significantly affected by\n$V_{cyc}$. Furthermore, both the direction and magnitude of the lactate shuttle\nbetween neurons and astrocytes turn out to depend on the relative cell glucose\nuptake while being roughly independent of $V_{cyc}$. These findings suggest\nthat, in absence of ad hoc activity-related constraints on neuronal and\nastrocytic metabolism, the glutamate-glutamine cycle does not control the\nrelative energy demand of neurons and astrocytes, and hence their glucose\nuptake and lactate exchange.\n",

Here, a substrate is reversibly modified by two\nantagonistic enzymes (a \"push-pull\" system) and the fraction in modified state\nundergoes a sharp switching from near-zero to near-unity at a critical value of\nthe ratio of the enzyme concentrations, under saturation conditions. ZOU and\nits extensions have been studied for several decades now, ever since the\nseminal paper of Goldbeter and Koshland (1981); however, a complete\nprobabilistic treatment, important for the study of fluctuations in finite\npopulations, is still lacking. In this paper, we study ZOU using a modular\napproach, akin to the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA). This\napproach leads to a set of Fokker-Planck (drift-diffusion) equations for the\nprobability distributions of the intermediate enzyme-bound complexes, as well\nas the modified/unmodified fractions of substrate molecules. We obtain explicit\nexpressions for various average fractions and their fluctuations in the linear\nnoise approximation (LNA). The emergence of a \"critical point\" for the\nswitching transition is rigorously established. New analytical results are\nderived for the average and variance of the fractional substrate concentration\nin various chemical states in the near-critical regime. For the total fraction\nin the modified state, the variance is shown to be a maximum near the critical\npoint and decays algebraically away from it, similar to a second-order phase\ntransition. The new analytical results are compared with existing ones as well\nas detailed numerical simulations using a Gillespie algorithm.\n",

Our method of network reduction is the use of \"steady state\napproximations\" that do not change the number of steady states. Our algorithm\nis designed to work at the wiring diagram level without the need to evaluate or\nsimplify Boolean functions. Also, our implementation of the algorithm takes\nadvantage of the sparsity typical of discrete models of biological systems. The\nmain features of our algorithm are that it works at the wiring diagram level,\nit runs in polynomial time, and it preserves the number of steady states. We\nused our results to study AND-NOT network models of gene networks and showed\nthat our algorithm greatly simplifies steady state analysis.

In the present report, a lac repressor\n(LacI)-mediated DNA immunoprecipitation experiment reveals that the natural\nLacI-lac DNA complex built in vivo is extremely tight and long-lived compared\nto the time scale of lac expression dynamics, which could functionally\ndisconnect the abortive expression bursts and forbid using the standard modes\nof lac bistability. As alternatives, purely kinetic mechanisms are examined for\ntheir capacity to restrict induction through: (i) widely scattered derepression\nrelated to the arrival time variance of a predominantly backward asymmetric\nrandom walk and (ii) an induction threshold arising in a single window of\nderepression without recourse to nonlinear multimeric binding and Hill\nfunctions. Considering the complete disengagement of the lac repressor from the\nlac promoter as the probabilistic consequence of a transient stepwise\nmechanism, is sufficient to explain the sigmoidal lac responses as functions of\ntime and of inducer concentration.

The\nmajor trend of malignant transformation can be described as a two-phase\nprocess, where an initial increase of network plasticity is followed by a\ndecrease of plasticity at late stages of tumor development. The fluctuating\nintensity of stress factors, like hypoxia, inflammation and the either\ncooperative or hostile interactions of tumor inter-cellular networks, all\nincrease the adaptation potential of cancer cells. This may lead to the bypass\nof cellular senescence, and to the development of cancer stem cells. We propose\nthat the central tenet of cancer stem cell definition lies exactly in the\nindefinability of cancer stem cells. Actual properties of cancer stem cells\ndepend on the individual \"stress-history\" of the given tumor. Cancer stem cells\nare characterized by an extremely large evolvability (i.e. a capacity to\ngenerate heritable phenotypic variation), which corresponds well with the\ndefining hallmarks of cancer stem cells: the possession of the capacity to\nself-renew and to repeatedly re-build the heterogeneous lineages of cancer\ncells that comprise a tumor in new environments. Cancer stem cells represent a\ncell population, which is adapted to adapt. We argue that the high evolvability\nof cancer stem cells is helped by their repeated transitions between plastic\n(proliferative, symmetrically dividing) and rigid (quiescent, asymmetrically\ndividing, often more invasive) phenotypes having plastic and rigid networks.\nThus, cancer stem cells reverse and replay cancer development multiple times.\nWe describe network models potentially explaining cancer stem cell-like\nbehavior.

Moreover, several of the predicted interventions are supported by\nexperiments.\n",

Chemical concentration measurements start with the binding of\nligand molecules to receptor proteins, which is an inherently noisy process,\nespecially at low concentrations. The signaling networks that transmit the\ninformation on the ligand concentration from the receptors into the cell have\nto filter this noise extrinsic to the cell as much as possible. These networks,\nhowever, are also stochastic in nature, which means that they will also add\nnoise to the transmitted signal. In this review, we will first discuss how the\ndiffusive transport and binding of ligand to the receptor sets the receptor\ncorrelation time, and then how downstream signaling pathways integrate the\nnoise in the receptor state; we will discuss how the number of receptors, the\nreceptor correlation time, and the effective integration time together set a\nfundamental limit on the precision of sensing. We then discuss how cells can\nremove the receptor noise while simultaneously suppressing the intrinsic noise\nin the signaling network. We describe why this mechanism of time integration\nrequires three classes of resources---receptors and their integration time,\nreadout molecules, energy---and how each resource class sets a fundamental\nsensing limit. We also briefly discuss the scheme of maximum-likelihood\nestimation, the role of receptor cooperativity, and how cellular copy protocols\ndiffer from canonical copy protocols typically considered in the computational\nliterature, explaining why cellular sensing systems can never reach the\nLandauer limit on the optimal trade-off between accuracy and energetic cost.\n",

We develop an experimentally feasible control framework\nfor nonlinear dynamical networks that exhibit multistability (multiple\ncoexisting final states or attractors), which are representative of, e.g., gene\nregulatory networks (GRNs). The control objective is to apply parameter\nperturbation to drive the system from one attractor to another, assuming that\nthe former is undesired and the latter is desired. To make our framework\npractically useful, we consider RESTRICTED parameter perturbation by imposing\nthe following two constraints: (a) it must be experimentally realizable and (b)\nit is applied only temporarily. We introduce the concept of ATTRACTOR NETWORK,\nin which the nodes are the distinct attractors of the system, and there is a\ndirectional link from one attractor to another if the system can be driven from\nthe former to the latter using restricted control perturbation. Introduction of\nthe attractor network allows us to formulate a controllability framework for\nnonlinear dynamical networks: a network is more controllable if the underlying\nattractor network is more strongly connected, which can be quantified. We\ndemonstrate our control framework using examples from various models of\nexperimental GRNs.

But what can be inferred about network dynamics when\nthere is no knowledge or information about the internal model or dynamics of\nparticipating nodes?

We achieve this by assuming a simple set of rules borrowed from\nneurophysiology. The model we develop reflects a local process from which\nglobal network dynamics emerges.

Our\nmechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half\nof the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian\nmolecular profiles observed in wild-type plants. A set of those essential\ninteractions is called herein a kernel of the circadian system. The kernel\nstructure unbiasedly reveals four interlocked negative feedback loops\ncontributing to circadian rhythms, and three feedback loops among them drive\nthe autonomous oscillation itself. Strikingly, the kernel structure, as well as\nthe whole clock circuitry, is overwhelmingly composed of inhibitory, rather\nthan activating, interactions between genes. We found that this tendency\nunderlies plant circadian molecular profiles which often exhibit\nsharply-shaped, cuspidate waveforms. Through the generation of these cuspidate\nprofiles, inhibitory interactions may facilitate the global coordination of\ntemporally-distant clock events that are markedly peaked at very specific times\nof day.

Recent in vitro} and in silico studies have corroborated this\nhypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is\nhampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here, using\nstochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van\nKampen's expansion, we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the\nmiRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL), a small module that is\nwidespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes, in order to\naccount for the effects of intermittency in the transcriptional activity of the\nmodulator gene.

By comparing with other regulatory\narchitectures, we find that direct transcriptional regulation significantly\noutperforms the IFFL in a broad range of kinetic parameters.

A\nmuch discussed hypothesis says that such model networks reproduce empirical\nfindings the best if they are tuned to operate at criticality, i.e. at the\nborderline between their ordered and disordered phases. Critical networks have\nbeen argued to lead to a number of functional advantages such as maximal\ndynamical range, maximal sensitivity to environmental changes, as well as to an\nexcellent trade off between stability and flexibility. Here, we study the\neffect of noise within the context of Boolean networks trained to learn complex\ntasks under supervision. We verify that quasi-critical networks are the ones\nlearning in the fastest possible way --even for asynchronous updating rules--\nand that the larger the task complexity the smaller the distance to\ncriticality. On the other hand, when additional sources of intrinsic noise in\nthe network states and/or in its wiring pattern are introduced, the optimally\nperforming networks become clearly subcritical. These results suggest that in\norder to compensate for inherent stochasticity, regulatory and other type of\nbiological networks might become subcritical rather than being critical, all\nthe most if the task to be performed has limited complexity.\n",

Part of the re-allocation accounts for the fact that, as the\ngrowth rate is limited by targeting specific metabolic activities, cells simply\nrespond by fine-tuning their proteome to invest more resources into the\nlimiting activity (i.e. by synthesizing more proteins devoted to it). However,\nthis is often accompanied by an overall re-organization of metabolism, aimed at\nimproving the growth yield under limitation by re-wiring resource through\ndifferent pathways.

However, while\nparticle-based models guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately\ndescribe the microscopic dynamics at very low copy numbers, the algorithms used\nto simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational efficiency\nand accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact\nalgorithm that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system\ninto M<N analytically tractable one- and two-particle systems; the analytical\nsolutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement an event-driven\nparticle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and\nspace while retaining access to their state variables at any moment. Here we\npresent \"eGFRD2\", a new eGFRD version that implements the principle of eGFRD in\nall dimensions, enabling efficient simulation of biochemical reaction-diffusion\nprocesses in the 3D cytoplasm, on 2D planes representing membranes, and on 1D\nelongated cylinders representative of, e.g., cytoskeletal tracks or DNA; in 1D,\nit also incorporates convective motion used to model active transport. We find\nthat, for low particle densities, eGFRD2 is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster\nthan optimized Brownian Dynamics. We exemplify the capabilities of eGFRD2 by\nsimulating an idealized model of Pom1 gradient formation, which involves 3D\ndiffusion, active transport on microtubules, and autophosphorylation on the\nmembrane, confirming recent results on this system and demonstrating that it\ncan efficiently operate under genuinely stochastic conditions.\n",

Several software packages exist for generating and\nanalyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value\nof a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However,\nsince gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great\ninterest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when\nconstructing a gene co-expression network. Here, we present an R package for\ncalculating the wTO, that, in contrast to existing packages, explicitly\naddresses the sign of the wTO values, and is thus especially valuable for the\nanalysis of gene regulatory networks. The package includes the calculation of\np-values (raw and adjusted) for each pairwise gene score. Our package also\nallows the calculation of networks from time series (without replicates). Since\nnetworks from independent datasets (biological repeats or related studies) are\nnot the same due to technical and biological noise in the data, we\nadditionally, incorporated a novel method for calculating a consensus network\n(CN) from two or more networks into our R package.

They start with a few known\ndisease-associated proteins and aim to find the rest of the pathway by\nexploring the PPI network around the known disease proteins. However, the\nsuccess of such methods has been limited, and failure cases have not been well\nunderstood. Here we study the PPI network structure of 519 disease pathways. We\nfind that 90% of pathways do not correspond to single well-connected components\nin the PPI network.

Here we aim at revealing a potential role\nof criticality of GRNs at a multicellular level which are hard to uncover\nthrough the single-cell-level studies, especially from an evolutionary\nviewpoint. Our model simulated the growth of a cell population from a single\nseed cell. All the cells were assumed to have identical GRNs. We induced\ngenetic perturbations to the GRN of the seed cell by adding, deleting, or\nswitching a regulatory link between a pair of genes. From numerical\nsimulations, we found that the criticality of GRNs facilitated the formation of\nnontrivial morphologies when the GRNs were critical in the presence of the\nevolutionary perturbations. Moreover, the criticality of GRNs produced\ntopologically homogenous cell clusters by adjusting the spatial arrangements of\ncells, which led to the formation of nontrivial morphogenetic patterns. Our\nfindings corresponded to an epigenetic viewpoint that heterogeneous and complex\nfeatures emerge from homogeneous and less complex components through the\ninteractions among them.

One particular class of temporal dynamics is\npersistent and transient signals, i.e. signals of long and short durations\nrespectively. It has been shown that the coherent type-1 feedforward loop with\nan AND logic at the output (or C1-FFL for short) can be used to discriminate a\npersistent input signal from a transient one. This has been done by modelling\nthe C1-FFL, and then use the model to show that persistent and transient input\nsignals give, respectively, a non-zero and zero output. Instead of assuming the\nstructure of C1-FFL, this paper shows that it is possible to deduce the C1-FFL\nmodel from the requirement of discriminating a persistent signal. We do this by\nfirst formulating a statistical detection problem of distinguishing persistent\nsignals from transient ones. The solution of the detection problem is to\ncompute the log-likelihood ratio of observing a persistent signal to a\ntransient signal. We show that, if this log-likelihood ratio is positive, which\nhappens when the signal is likely to be persistent, then it can be\napproximately computed by a C1-FFL. Although the capability of C1-FFL to\ndiscriminate persistent signals is known, this paper adds an information\nprocessing interpretation on how a C1-FFL works as a detector of persistent\nsignals.\n",

Because experiments can be\ncostly and time-consuming it is desirable to determine experiments providing\nthe most useful information. If a sequence of experiments is to be performed,\nexperimental design is needed to determine the order. A classical approach is\nto maximally reduce the overall uncertainty in the model, meaning maximal\nentropy reduction. A recently proposed method takes into account both model\nuncertainty and the translational objective, for instance, optimal structural\nintervention in gene regulatory networks, where the aim is to alter the\nregulatory logic to maximally reduce the long-run likelihood of being in a\ncancerous state. The mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU) quantifies\nuncertainty based on the degree to which model uncertainty affects the\nobjective.

Although deciding multistationarity for a polynomial dynamical\nsystem is an effective question in real algebraic geometry, it is in general\ndifficult to determine whether a given network can give rise to a\nmultistationary system, and if so, to identify witnesses to multistationarity,\nthat is, specific parameter values for which the system exhibits multiple\nsteady states. Here we investigate both problems. First, we build on work of\nConradi, Feliu, Mincheva, and Wiuf, who showed that for certain reaction\nnetworks whose steady states admit a positive parametrization,\nmultistationarity is characterized by whether a certain \"critical function\"\nchanges sign. Here, we allow for more general parametrizations, which make it\nmuch easier to determine the existence of a sign change. This is particularly\nsimple when the steady-state equations are linearly equivalent to binomials; we\ngive necessary conditions for this to happen, which hold for many networks\nstudied in the literature. We also give a sufficient condition for\nmultistationarity of networks whose steady-state equations can be replaced by\nequivalent triangular-form equations. Finally, we present methods for finding\nwitnesses to multistationarity, which we show work well for certain structured\nreaction networks, including those common to biological signaling pathways.

A particular focus is on the\ncase of reaction networks whose steady states admit a monomial parametrization.\nFor such systems we show that in the space of total concentrations\nmultistationarity is scale invariant: if there is multistationarity for some\nvalue of the total concentrations, then there is multistationarity on the\nentire ray containing this value (possibly for different rate constants) -- and\nvice versa. Moreover, for these networks it is possible to decide about\nmultistationarity independent of the rate constants by formulating\nsemi-algebraic conditions that involve only concentration variables. These\nconditions can easily be extended to include total concentrations. Hence\nquantifier elimination may give new insights into multistationarity regions in\nthe space of total concentrations. To demonstrate this, we show that for the\ndistributive phosphorylation of a protein at two binding sites\nmultistationarity is only possible if the total concentration of the substrate\nis larger than either the total concentration of the kinase or the total\nconcentration of the phosphatase. This result is enabled by the chamber\ndecomposition of the space of total concentrations from polyhedral geometry.\nTogether with the corresponding sufficiency result of Bihan et al. this yields\na characterization of multistationarity up to lower dimensional regions.\n",

It occurs when the\nsimultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or\ngenes is lethal, while the default of the functional reaction or gene in the\npair is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Based on a complex\nsystems approach and by using computational techniques on bacterial\ngenome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the\nfunctional PSL partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure\nviability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant\nfraction of other interconnected reactions forming what we call a SL cluster.\nInterestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of silent\ncoessential reactions, which band together to form backup systems, and of other\nfunctional and silent reactions in the metabolic network. This strong overlap,\nalso detected at the level of genes, mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and\nincreased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided\nby essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions\nand genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the\nintersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient\ndrug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved\nstrategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.\n",

A recently proposed\nabstraction method uses deep learning to replace this CTMC with a discrete-time\ncontinuous-space process, by training a mixture density deep neural network\nwith traces sampled at regular time intervals (which can obtained either by\nsimulating a given CRN or as time-series data from experiment). The major\nadvantage of such abstraction is that it produces a computational model that is\ndramatically cheaper to execute, while preserving the statistical features of\nthe training data. In general, the abstraction accuracy improves with the\namount of training data. However, depending on a CRN, the overall quality of\nthe method -- the efficiency gain and abstraction accuracy -- will also depend\non the choice of neural network architecture given by hyper-parameters such as\nthe layer types and connections between them. As a consequence, in practice,\nthe modeller would have to take care of finding the suitable architecture\nmanually, for each given CRN, through a tedious and time-consuming\ntrial-and-error cycle. In this paper, we propose to further automatise deep\nabstractions for stochastic CRNs, through learning the optimal neural network\narchitecture along with learning the transition kernel of the abstract process.\nAutomated search of the architecture makes the method applicable directly to\nany given CRN, which is time-saving for deep learning experts and crucial for\nnon-specialists.

Over evolutionary timescales, these\nconstraints feed back onto smaller molecular subnetworks comprising the\norganism. The evolution of biological networks is studied by considering a\nnetwork of a few nodes embedded in a larger context. Taking into account this\nfact that any network under study is actually embedded in a larger context, we\ndefine network architecture, not on the basis of physical interactions alone,\nbut rather as a specification of the manner in which constraints are placed\nupon the states of its nodes. We show that such network architectures\npossessing cycles in their topology, in contrast to those that do not, may be\nsubjected to unsatisfiable constraints. This may be a significant factor\nleading to selection biased against those network architectures where such\ninconsistent constraints are more likely to arise. We proceed to quantify the\nlikelihood of inconsistency arising as a function of network architecture\nfinding that, in the absence of sampling bias over the space of possible\nconstraints and for a given network size, networks with a larger number of\ncycles are more likely to have unsatisfiable constraints placed upon them. Our\nresults identify a constraint that, at least in isolation, would contribute to\na bias in the evolutionary process toward more hierarchical-modular versus\ncompletely connected network architectures. Together, these results highlight\nthe context-dependence of the functionality of biological networks.\n",

Understanding the advantages and limitations of\ndifferent network inference methods is key to their effective application in\ndifferent circumstances. The common structural properties shared by diverse\nnetworks naturally pose a challenge when it comes to devising accurate\ninference methods, but surprisingly, there is a paucity of comparison and\nevaluation methods. Historically, every new methodology has only been tested\nagainst \\textit{gold standard} (true values) purpose-designed synthetic and\nreal-world (validated) biological networks. In this paper we aim to assess the\nimpact of taking into consideration aspects of topological and information\ncontent in the evaluation of the final accuracy of an inference procedure.\nSpecifically, we will compare the best inference methods, in both\ngraph-theoretic and information-theoretic terms, for preserving topological\nproperties and the original information content of synthetic and biological\nnetworks. New methods for performance comparison are introduced by borrowing\nideas from gene set enrichment analysis and by applying concepts from\nalgorithmic complexity. Experimental results show that no individual algorithm\noutperforms all others in all cases, and that the challenging and non-trivial\nnature of network inference is evident in the struggle of some of the\nalgorithms to turn in a performance that is superior to random guesswork.\nTherefore special care should be taken to suit the method to the purpose at\nhand. Finally, we show that evaluations from data generated using different\nunderlying topologies have different signatures that can be used to better\nchoose a network reconstruction method.\n",

Obtaining the optimal\ninfinite-horizon control strategy for this problem is not attainable in\ngeneral, and we apply reinforcement learning and Gaussian process techniques to\nfind a near-optimal solution. The POBDS is first transformed to a\ndirectly-observed Markov Decision Process in a continuous belief space, and the\nGaussian process is used for modeling the cost function over the belief and\nintervention spaces. Reinforcement learning then is used to learn the cost\nfunction from the available gene expression data. In addition, we employ\nsparsification, which enables the control of large partially-observed GRNs.

The fateful decision to exit or remain in the\npluripotent state is regulated by complex genetic regulatory network. Latest\nadvances in transcriptomics have made it possible to infer basic topologies of\npluripotency governing networks. The inferred network topologies, however, only\nencode boolean information while remaining silent about the roles of dynamics\nand molecular noise in gene expression. These features are widely considered\nessential for functional decision making. Herein we developed a framework for\nextending the boolean level networks into models accounting for individual\ngenetic switches and promoter architecture which allows mechanistic\ninterrogation of the roles of molecular noise, external signaling, and network\ntopology. We demonstrate the pluripotent state of the network to be a broad\nattractor which is robust to variations of gene expression. Dynamics of exiting\nthe pluripotent state, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the\nmolecular noise originating from genetic switching events which makes cells\nmore responsive to extracellular signals. Lastly we show that steady state\nprobability landscape can be significantly remodeled by global gene switching\nrates alone which can be taken as a proxy for how global epigenetic\nmodifications exert control over stability of pluripotent states.\n",

Nonetheless, it might be difficult to gather\nenough data to precisely capture the behavior of a biological system into a set\nof Boolean functions. These issues can be dealt with to some extent using\nparametrised Boolean networks (ParBNs), as it allows to leave some update\nfunctions unspecified. In this paper, we attack the control problem for ParBNs\nwith asynchronous semantics. While there is an extensive work on controlling\nBNs without parameters, the problem of control for ParBNs has not been in fact\naddressed yet. The goal of control is to ensure the stabilisation of a system\nin a given state using as few interventions as possible. There are many ways to\ncontrol BN dynamics.

A naive approach\nto handle control of ParBNs is using parameter scan and solve the control\nproblem for each parameter valuation separately using known techniques for\nnon-parametrised BNs. This approach is however highly inefficient as the\nparameter space of ParBNs grows doubly-exponentially in the worst case.

Next, we study the dynamics of a re-wired version of the core\nmetabolator, dubbed the \"reverse\" metabolator, and show that it exhibits a\nsubstantially richer set of dynamical behaviors, including both local and\nglobal oscillations. Prompted by the observation of relaxation oscillations in\nthe reverse metabolator, we study the role that a separation of genetic and\nmetabolic time scales may play in its dynamics, and find that widely separated\ntime scales promote stability in the circuit.

The effects of white noise on the regime shift in bistable systems\nhave been well characterized, however little is known about such effects of\ncolored noise (noise with non-zero correlation time). Here, we show that noise\ncorrelation time, by considering a genetic circuit of autoactivation, can have\nsignificant effect on the regime shift in gene expression. We demonstrate this\ntheoretically, using stochastic potential, stationary probability density\nfunction and first-passage time based on the Fokker-Planck description, where\nthe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is used to model colored noise. We find that\nincrease in noise correlation time in degradation rate can induce a regime\nshift from low to high protein concentration state and enhance the bistable\nregime, while increase in noise correlation time in basal rate retain the\nbimodal distribution. We then show how cross-correlated colored noises in basal\nand degradation rates can induce regime shifts from low to high protein\nconcentration state, but reduce the bistable regime. In addition, we show that\nearly warning indicators can also be used to predict shifts between distinct\nphenotypic states in gene expression.

A sub-ensemble is the critical ensemble.\nThere is now strong evidence that genetic regulatory networks are dynamically\ncritical, and that evolution is exploring the critical sub-ensemble. The\ngeneric properties of this sub-ensemble predict essential features of cell\ndifferentiation. In particular, the number of attractors in such networks\nscales as the DNA content raised to the 0.63 power. Data on the number of cell\ntypes as a function of the DNA content per cell shows a scaling relationship of\n0.88.

The precise\nmolecular mechanism of apoptosis signaling and how these two pathways are\ndifferentially activated under distinct apoptotic stimuli is poorly understood.\nWe developed a Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation model that can\ncharacterize distinct signaling behaviors in the two major pathways of\napoptotic signaling using a novel probability distribution-based approach.\nSpecifically, we show that for a weak death signal, such as low levels of death\nligand Fas (CD95) binding or under stress conditions, the type 2 mitochondrial\npathway dominates apoptotic signaling. Our results also show signaling in the\ntype 2 pathway is stochastic, where the population average over many cells does\nnot capture the cell-to-cell fluctuations in the time course (~1 - 10 hours) of\ndownstream caspase-3 activation. On the contrary, the probability distribution\nof caspase-3 activation for the mitochondrial pathway shows a distinct bimodal\nbehavior that can be used to characterize the stochastic signaling in type 2\napoptosis. Interestingly, such stochastic fluctuations in apoptosis signaling\nhappen even in the presence of large numbers of signaling molecules. In a\nfluctuating environment, such stochasticity in the timecourse of caspase-3\nactivation may be an adaptive mechanism for allowing a competing survival\nsignal to win over a weak death trigger before the critical cell fate decision\nis made and thus minimizes the risk of pathologies.\n",

In particular, turning observed\nstructural regularities into organizing principles underlying systemic\nfunctions is a crucial task that can be significantly addressed after endowing\ncomplex network representations of metabolism with the notion of geometric\ndistance. Here, we design a cartographic map of metabolic networks by embedding\nthem into a simple geometry that provides a natural explanation for their\nobserved network topology and that codifies node proximity as a measure of\nhidden structural similarities. We assume a simple and general connectivity law\nthat gives more probability of interaction to metabolite/reaction pairs which\nare closer in the hidden space.

We adopt\ncomprehensive perspectives to systematically investigate three different but\nclosely related realizations in recent literature: namely the potential\nlandscape theory from the steady state distribution of stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs), the quasi-potential from the large deviation theory, and the\nconstruction through SDE decomposition and A-type integral.The connections\namong these theories are established in this paper. We demonstrate that the\nquasi-potential is the zero noise limit of the potential landscape. We also\nshow that the potential function in the third proposal coincides with the\nquasi-potential. The most probable transition path by minimizing the\nOnsager-Machlup or Freidlin-Wentzell action functional is discussed as well.\nFurthermore, we compare the difference between local and global quasi-potential\nthrough the exchange of limit order for time and noise amplitude. As a\nconsequence of such explorations, we arrive at the existence result for the SDE\ndecomposition while deny its uniqueness in general cases. It is also clarified\nthat the A-type integral is more appropriate to be applied to the decomposed\nSDEs rather than the original one.

In order to understand this KaiABC\nclockwork, we need to analyze both the macroscopic synchronization of a large\nnumber of KaiC hexamers and the microscopic reactions and structural changes in\nindividual KaiC molecules. In the present paper, we explain two coarse-grained\ntheoretical models, the many-molecule (MM) model and the single-molecule (SM)\nmodel, to bridge the gap between macroscopic and microscopic understandings. In\nthe simulation results with these models, ATP hydrolysis drives oscillation of\nindividual KaiC hexamers and ATP hydrolysis is necessary for synchronizing\noscillations of a large number of KaiC hexamers. Sensitive temperature\ndependence of the lifetime of the ADP bound state in the CI domain of KaiC\nhexamers makes the oscillation period temperature insensitive. ATPase activity\nis correlated to the frequency of phosphorylation oscillation in the single\nmolecule of KaiC hexamer, which should be the origin of the observed\nensemble-level correlation between the ATPase activity and the frequency of\nphosphorylation oscillation. Thus, the simulation results with the MM and SM\nmodels suggest that ATP hydrolysis randomly occurring in each CI domain of\nindividual KaiC hexamers is a key process for oscillatory behaviors of the\nensemble of many KaiC hexamers.\n",

Using multiscale\nmodeling and simplification techniques, we show that the ZINB distribution of\nmRNA abundance and the phenomenon of transcriptional bursting naturally emerge\nfrom a three-state stochastic transcription model. We further reveal a\nnontrivial quantitative relation between dropout events and transcriptional\nbursting, which provides novel insights into how and to what extent the burst\nsize and burst frequency could reduce the dropout rate. Three different\nbiophysical origins of over-dispersion are also clarified at the single-cell\nlevel.\n",

Second, we apply this\nmethod to a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and explore the evolution\nof mutational robustness and bistability. Living systems have developed their\nfunctions through evolutionary processes. To understand the particularities of\nthis process theoretically, evolutionary simulation (ES) alone is insufficient\nbecause the outcomes of ES depend on evolutionary pathways. We need a reference\nsystem for comparison. An appropriate reference system for this purpose is an\nensemble of the randomly sampled genotypes. However, generating high-fitness\ngenotypes by simple random sampling is difficult because such genotypes are\nrare. In this study, we used the multicanonical Monte Carlo method developed in\nstatistical physics to construct a reference ensemble of GRNs and compared it\nwith the outcomes of ES. We obtained the following results. First, mutational\nrobustness was significantly higher in ES than in the reference ensemble at the\nsame fitness level. Second, the emergence of a new phenotype, bistability, was\ndelayed in evolution. Third, the bistable group of GRNs contains many\nmutationally fragile GRNs compared with those in the non-bistable group. This\nsuggests that the delayed emergence of bistability is a consequence of the\nmutation-selection mechanism.\n",

Yet\nlittle mathematical attention has been paid to the complex network properties\nof genealogical networks, especially at large scales.\n  The structure of genealogical networks is of particular interest due to the\npractice of forming unions, e.g. marriages, that are typically well outside\none's immediate family.

To study the effect this has on genealogical networks we\nuse persistent homology to identify and compare the structure of 101\ngenealogical and 31 other social networks. Specifically, we introduce the\nnotion of a network's persistence curve, which encodes the network's set of\npersistence intervals. We find that the persistence curves of genealogical\nnetworks have a distinct structure when compared to other social networks. This\ndifference in structure also extends to subnetworks of genealogical and social\nnetworks suggesting that, even with incomplete data, persistent homology can be\nused to meaningfully analyze genealogical networks.

This motif may reduce cross-talk between signalling pathways, as the\nsecond phosphorylation site allows for proofreading, especially when\nphosphorylation is distributive rather than processive. Recent studies suggest\nthat phosphorylation can be `pseudo-processive' in the crowded cellular\nenvironment, as rebinding after the first phosphorylation is enhanced by slow\ndiffusion. Here, we use a simple model with unsaturated reactants to show that\nspecificity for one substrate over another drops as rebinding increases and\npseudo-processive behavior becomes possible. However, this loss of specificity\nwith increased rebinding is typically also observed if two distinct enzyme\nspecies are required for phosphorylation, i.e. when the system is necessarily\ndistributive. Thus the loss of specificity is due to an intrinsic reduction in\nselectivity with increased rebinding, which benefits inefficient reactions,\nrather than pseudo-processivity itself. We also show that proofreading can\nremain effective when the intended signalling pathway exhibits high levels of\nrebinding-induced pseudo-processivity, unlike other proposed advantages of the\ndual phosphorylation motif.\n",

Here we numerically study the\nconditions under which the MA equations yield results reflecting the true\nstochastic dynamics of the system. We show that for bistable and oscillatory\nchemical systems with deterministic initial conditions, the solution of the MA\nequations can be interpreted as a valid approximation to the true moments of\nthe CME, only when the steady-state mean molecule numbers obtained from the\nchemical master equation fall within a certain finite range. The same validity\ncriterion for monostable systems implies that the steady-state mean molecule\nnumbers obtained from the chemical master equation must be above a certain\nthreshold. For mean molecule numbers outside of this range of validity, the MA\nequations lead to either qualitatively wrong oscillatory dynamics or to\nunphysical predictions such as negative variances in the molecule numbers or\nmultiple steady-state moments of the stationary distribution as the initial\nconditions are varied.

In this work, we investigate the\neffect of realistic extrinsic noises acting on gene deactivation in a common\nnetwork motif - the positive feedback of a transcription factor on its own\nsynthesis - under a variety of settings, i.e., distinct cellular types,\ndistribution of proteins and properties of the external perturbations. At\nvariance with standard models where the perturbations are Gaussian unbounded,\nwe focus here on bounded extrinsic noises to better mimic biological reality.\nOur results suggest that the gene switching velocity is a key parameter to\nmodulate the response of the network. Simulations suggest that, if the gene\nswitching is fast and many proteins are present, an irreversible noise-induced\nfirst order transition is observed as a function of the noise intensity. If\nnoise intensity is further increased a second order transition is also\nobserved. When gene switching is fast, a similar scenario is observed even when\nfew proteins are present, provided that larger cells are considered, which is\nmainly influenced by noise autocorrelation. On the contrary, if the gene\nswitching is slow, no fist order transitions are observed. In the concluding\nremarks possible implications of the irreversible transitions for cellular\ndifferentiation are briefly discussed.\n",

Here, inspired by recent work providing a quantitative\ndescription of small regulatory elements as information-conveying channels, we\ncharacterize the effectiveness of miRNA-mediated regulation in terms of the\noptimal information flow achievable between modulator (transcription factors)\nand target nodes (long RNAs). Our findings show that, while a sufficiently\nlarge degree of target derepression is needed to activate miRNA-mediated\ntransmission, (a) in case of differential mechanisms of complex processing\nand/or transcriptional capabilities, regulation by a post-transcriptional\nmiRNA-channel can outperform that achieved through direct transcriptional\ncontrol; moreover, (b) in the presence of large populations of weakly\ninteracting miRNA molecules the extra noise coming from titration disappears,\nallowing the miRNA-channel to process information as effectively as the direct\nchannel. These observations establish the limits of miRNA-mediated\npost-transcriptional cross-talk and suggest that, besides providing a degree of\nnoise buffering, this type of control may be effectively employed in cells both\nas a failsafe mechanism and as a preferential fine tuner of gene expression,\npointing to the specific situations in which each of these functionalities is\nmaximized.\n",

Connections between the two modeling regimes have been studied\nsince the seminal paper by Kurtz (1972), where the deterministic model is shown\nto be a limit of a properly rescaled stochastic model over compact time\nintervals. Further, more recent studies have connected the long-term behaviors\nof the two models when the reaction network satisfies certain graphical\nproperties, such as weak reversibility and a deficiency of zero.\n  These connections have led some to conjecture a link between the long-term\nbehavior of the two models exists, in some sense.

When embedded in a cell, a circuit\nmodule becomes a small subnetwork within a larger environmental network, and\nits dynamics is therefore affected by potentially unknown interactions with the\nenvironment. It is well-known that the presence of the environment not only\ncauses extrinsic noise but also memory effects, which means that the dynamics\nof the subnetwork is affected by its past states via a memory function that is\ncharacteristic of the environment. We study several generic scenarios for the\ncoupling between a small module and a larger environment, with the environment\nconsisting of a chain of mono-molecular reactions. By mapping the dynamics of\nthis coupled system onto random walks, we are able to give exact analytical\nexpressions for the arising memory functions.

Here we develop a theoretical and computational\nframework that relates the biophysics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)\nwithin a signaling network to its information processing properties. To do so,\nwe generalize statistical physics-inspired models for protein binding to\naccount for interactions that depend on post-translational state (e.g.\nphosphorylation). By combining these models with information-theoretic methods,\nwe find that PPIs are a key determinant of information transmission within a\nsignaling network, with weak interactions giving rise to \"noise\" that\ndiminishes information transmission. While noise can be mitigated by increasing\ninteraction strength, the accompanying increase in transmission comes at the\nexpense of a slower dynamical response. This suggests that the biophysics of\nsignaling protein interactions give rise to a fundamental \"speed-information\"\ntrade-off. Surprisingly, we find that cross-talk between pathways in complex\nsignaling networks do not significantly alter information capacity--an\nobservation that may partially explain the promiscuity and ubiquity of weak\nPPIs in heavily interconnected networks.

In\naddition to function, the GRNs possess several kinds of robustness. This\nrobustness means that systems do not lose their functionality when exposed to\ndisturbances such as mutations or noise, and is widely observed at many levels\nin living systems. Both function and robustness have been acquired through\nevolution. In this respect, GRNs utilized in living systems are rare among all\npossible GRNs. In this study, we explored the fitness landscape of GRNs and\ninvestigated how robustness emerged in highly-fit GRNs. We considered a toy\nmodel of GRNs with one input gene and one output gene. The difference in the\nexpression level of the output gene between two input states, \"on\" and \"off\",\nwas considered as fitness. Thus, the determination of the fitness of a GRN was\nbased on how sensitively it responded to the input. We employed the\nmulticanonical Monte Carlo method, which can sample GRNs randomly in a wide\nrange of fitness levels, and classified the GRNs according to their fitness. As\na result, the following properties were found: (1) Highly-fit GRNs exhibited\nbistability for intermediate input between \"on\" and \"off\". This bistability\nemerges necessarily as fitness increases. (2) These highly-fit GRNs were robust\nagainst noise because of their bistability. (3) GRNs that were robust against\nmutations were not extremely rare among the highly-fit GRNs. This implies that\nmutational robustness is readily acquired through the evolutionary process.\n",

Competition to bind miRNAs tends in turn to\ncorrelate their targets, establishing effective RNA-RNA interactions that can\ninfluence expression levels, buffer fluctuations and promote signal\npropagation. Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small\nmotifs both at steady state and \\red{away from stationarity}. Experimental\nevidence, on the other hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)\ncrosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA networks could however favour the\nintegration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant large-scale\neffects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to\nwhich crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its\nemergent systemic features in silico in large-scale miRNA-RNA network\nreconstructions. We show that, although generically weak, system-level\ncrosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities, (ii)\ncan achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are\nrobust to variability in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly\nnon-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA interaction parameters.\nFurthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is\nstrongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network's\ntopology, crosstalk may functionally be favoured by natural selection. These\nresults suggest that, besides their repressive role, miRNAs mediate a weak but\nresilient and context-independent network of cross-regulatory interactions that\ninterconnect the transcriptome, stabilize expression levels and support\nsystem-level responses.\n",

It outputs a reduced group of genes marked as relevant\nfor treatment response. Technically, the proposed approach is both a\ngeneralization and an extension of WGCNA. It aims to identify specific modules\nof overlapping communities underlying the co-expression network of genes.\nModule detection is achieved by using Hierarchical Link Clustering. The\noverlapping nature of the systems' regulatory domains that generate\nco-expression can be identified by such modules. LASSO regression is employed\nto analyze phenotypic responses of modules to treatment.\n  Results. The workflow is applied to rice (Oryza sativa), a major food source\nknown to be highly sensitive to salt stress. The workflow identifies 19 rice\ngenes that seem relevant in the response to salt stress. They are distributed\nacross 6 modules: 3 modules, each grouping together 3 genes, are associated to\nshoot K content; 2 modules of 3 genes are associated to shoot biomass; and 1\nmodule of 4 genes is associated to root biomass. These genes represent target\ngenes for the improvement of salinity tolerance in rice.\n  Conclusion. A more effective framework to reduce the search-space for target\ngenes that respond to a specific treatment is introduced.

Here we consider\nhomeostasis as a phenomenon of network dynamics. In this context, we improve a\ngeneral theory for the analysis of homeostasis in network dynamical systems\nwith distinguished input and output nodes, called `input-output networks'. The\ntheory allows one to define `homeostasis types' of a given network in a `model\nindependent' fashion, in the sense that the classification depends on the\nnetwork topology rather than on the specific model equations. Each `homeostasis\ntype' represents a possible mechanism for generating homeostasis and is\nassociated with a suitable `subnetwork motif' of the original network. Our\ncontribution is an extension of the theory to the case of networks with\nmultiple input nodes. To showcase our theory, we apply it to bacterial\nchemotaxis, a paradigm for homeostasis in biochemical systems. By considering a\nrepresentative model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis, we verify that the\ncorresponding abstract network has multiple input nodes. Thus showing that our\nextension of the theory allows for the inclusion of an important class of\nmodels that were previously out of reach. Moreover, from our abstract point of\nview, the occurrence of homeostasis in the studied model is caused by a new\nmechanism, called input counterweight homeostasis. This new homeostasis\nmechanism was discovered in the course of our investigation and is generated by\na balancing between the several input nodes of the network -- therefore, it\nrequires the existence of at least two input nodes to occur. Finally, the\nframework developed here allows one to formalize a notion of `robustness' of\nhomeostasis based on the concept of `genericity' from the theory dynamical\nsystems. We discuss how this kind of robustness of homeostasis appears in the\nchemotaxis model.\n",

While these models are\nconvenient for detailed simulations, their size is often an obstacle to\nderiving mechanistic insights. One way to address this issue is to perform an\nexact model reduction by finding a self-consistent lower-dimensional projection\nof the corresponding dynamical system. Recently, a new algorithm CLUE has been\ndesigned and implemented, which allows one to construct an exact linear\nreduction of the smallest possible dimension such that the fixed variables of\ninterest are preserved. It turned out that allowing arbitrary linear\ncombinations (as opposed to zero-one combinations used in the prior approaches)\nmay yield a much smaller reduction. However, there was a drawback: some of the\nnew variables did not have clear physical meaning, thus making the reduced\nmodel harder to interpret. We design and implement an algorithm that, given an\nexact linear reduction, re-parametrizes it by performing an invertible\ntransformation of the new coordinates to improve the interpretability of the\nnew variables. We apply our algorithm to three case studies and show that\n\"uninterpretable\" variables disappear entirely in all the case studies.

In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical\nModel (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high\ndimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the\ndefault Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex\ninteraction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based\nHill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)\nleaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its\nmodifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from\nmicro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the\nanalytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which\nboth directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs.\n  We conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC\nalgorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously\nmodelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting\nin the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the\ncomplex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific\nstructure in advance. On the contrary, Glasso and modifications model\nunnecessary dependencies at the expense of the probabilistic information in the\nnetwork and of a structural bias in the JPD function that can only be relieved\nincluding many parameters.\n",

Motivated to protect the cell from viral infections, we extended\nthis theory to total controllability and introduced a new concept of control\nhubs. Perturbation to any control hub renders the cell uncontrollable by\nexogenous stimuli, e.g., viral infections, so control hubs are ideal drug\ntargets. We developed an efficient algorithm for finding all control hubs and\napplied it to the largest homogenous human protein-protein interaction network.\nOur new method outperforms several popular gene-selection methods, including\nthat based on structural controllability. The final 65 druggable control hubs\nare enriched with functions of cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, and\nresponses to cellular stress and nutrient levels, revealing critical pathways\ninduced by SARS-CoV-2. These druggable control hubs led to drugs in 4 major\ncategories: antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents, drugs on central nerve\nsystems, and dietary supplements and hormones that boost immunity. Their\nfunctions also provided deep insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of the\ndrugs for Covid-19 therapy, making the new approach an explainable drug\nrepurposing method. A remarkable example is Fostamatinib that has been shown to\nlower mortality, shorten the length of ICU stay, and reduce disease severity of\nhospitalized Covid-19 patients. The drug targets 10 control hubs, 9 of which\nare kinases that play key roles in cell differentiation and programmed death.\nOne such kinase is RIPK1 that directly interacts with viral protein nsp12, the\nRdRp of the virus. The study produced many control hubs that were not targets\nof existing drugs but were enriched with proteins on membranes and the\nNF-$\\kappa$B pathway, so are excellent candidate targets for new drugs.\n",

One of the recent approaches is based on network structural\ncontrollability that focuses on finding a control scheme and driver genes that\ncan steer the cell from an arbitrary state to a designated state. While\ntheoretically sound, this approach is impractical for many reasons, e.g., the\ncontrol scheme is often not unique and half of the nodes may be driver genes\nfor the cell. We developed a novel approach that transcends structural\ncontrollability. Instead of considering driver genes for one control scheme, we\nconsidered control hub genes that reside in the middle of a control path of\nevery control scheme. Control hubs are the most vulnerable spots for\ncontrolling the cell and exogenous stimuli on them may render the cell\nuncontrollable. We adopted control hubs as cancer-keep genes (CKGs) and applied\nthem to a gene regulatory network of bladder cancer (BLCA). All the genes on\nthe cell cycle and p53 singling pathways in BLCA are CKGs, confirming the\nimportance of these genes and the two pathways in cancer. A smaller set of 35\nsensitive CKGs (sCKGs) for BLCA was identified by removing network links.

Boolean networks have\nemerged as a successful class of models for capturing the behavior of GRNs.

Machine learning-based methods have shown\nstrong abilities in predicting molecular energy and properties and are much\nfaster than DFT calculations. Molecular energy is at least related to atoms,\nbonds, bond angles, torsion angles, and nonbonding atom pairs. Previous\nTransformer models only use atoms as inputs which lack explicit modeling of the\naforementioned factors. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Moleformer, a\nnovel Transformer architecture that takes nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds and\nnonbonding atom pairs) as inputs and models the interactions among them using\nrotational and translational invariant geometry-aware spatial encoding.\nProposed spatial encoding calculates relative position information including\ndistances and angles among nodes and edges. We benchmark Moleformer on OC20 and\nQM9 datasets, and our model achieves state-of-the-art on the initial state to\nrelaxed energy prediction of OC20 and is very competitive in QM9 on predicting\nquantum chemical properties compared to other Transformer and Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) methods which proves the effectiveness of the proposed\ngeometry-aware spatial encoding in Moleformer.\n",

In\nthis work, we investigate how explicitly dynamical stochasticity in delays\nmodulates the effect of delayed feedback. To do so, we consider a hybrid model\nwhere stochastic delays evolve by a continuous-time Markov chain, and between\nswitching events, the system of interest evolves via a deterministic delay\nequation. Our main contribution is the calculation of an effective delay\nequation in the fast switching limit. This effective equation maintains the\ninfluence of all subsystem delays and cannot be replaced with a single\neffective delay. To illustrate the relevance of this calculation, we\ninvestigate a simple model of stochastically switching delayed feedback\nmotivated by gene regulation.

Increasing heterologous gene expression increases burden to the\nhost, resulting in host growth reduction; which reduces overall heterologous\nprotein abundance. Hence, it is difficult to design predictable genetic\ncircuits. Here, we develop two biophysical models; one for promoter, another\nfor RBS; to correlate heterologous gene expression and growth reduction. We\nmodel cellular resource allocation in E. coli to describe the burden, as growth\nreduction, caused by genetic circuits. To facilitate their uses in genetic\ncircuit design, inputs to the model are common characteristics of biological\nparts [e.g. relative promoter strength (RPU) and relative ribosome binding\nsites strength (RRU)]. The models suggest that E. coli's growth rate reduces\nlinearly with increasing RPU / RRU of the genetic circuits; thus, providing 2\nhandy models taking parts characteristics as input to estimate growth rate\nreduction for fine tuning genetic circuit design in silico prior to\nconstruction. Our promoter model correlates well with experiments using various\ngenetic circuits, both single and double expression cassettes, up to a relative\npromoter unit of 3.7 with a 60% growth rate reduction (average R2 ~ 0.9).\n",

While such\nsystems may have some control over the internal dynamics that make up this\nprogression, a challenge for many is to regulate behaviour under what are often\nhighly variable external environments acting as system inputs. In this work, we\nstudy a simple analogue of this problem through a linear multicompartment model\nsubject to a stochastic input in the form of a mean-reverting\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, a type of Gaussian process.

Semi-analytical results demonstrate that feedback and\nfeedforward loops can enhance system robustness, and simulation results probe\nthe intractable problem of the first passage time distribution, which has\nspecific relevance to eventual cell lysis in the viral replication cycle.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the smoothing seen in the process is a consequence\nof the discreteness of the system, and does not manifest in system with\ncontinuous transport.

Geometric\nsingular perturbation theory, of which eigenvalue disparity is central,\nprovides a coordinate-free framework for deriving reduced mass action models in\nthe deterministic realm. Moreover, homologous deterministic reductions are\noften employed in stochastic models to reduce the computational complexity\nrequired to simulate reactions with the Gillespie algorithm. Interestingly,\nseveral detailed studies indicate that timescale separation does not always\nguarantee the accuracy of reduced stochastic models. In this work, we examine\nthe roles of timescale separation and coordinate transformations in the\nreduction of the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) and, unlike previous studies,\nwe do not require the system to be comprised of distinct fast and slow\nvariables. Instead, we adopt a coordinate-free approach. We demonstrate that\neigenvalue disparity does not guarantee the accuracy of the reduced LNA, known\nas the slow scale LNA (ssLNA). However, the inaccuracy of the ssLNA can often\nbe eliminated with a proper coordinate transformation. For planar systems in\nseparated (standard) form, we prove that the error between the variances of the\nslow variable generated by the LNA and the ssLNA is $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$.\nWe also address a nilpotent Jacobian scenario and use the blow-up method to\nconstruct a reduced equation that is accurate near the singular limit in the\ndeterministic regime.

Robust perfect\nadaptation (RPA) refers to an adaptation property that does not require\nfine-tuning of system parameters. RPA plays a vital role for the survival of\nliving systems in unpredictable environments. However, complex interaction\npatterns in biochemical systems pose a significant challenge in identifying RPA\nand associated regulatory mechanisms. The goal of this paper is to present a\nnovel approach for finding all RPA properties that are realized for a generic\nchoice of kinetics for general deterministic chemical reaction systems. This is\naccomplished by proving that an RPA property is represented by a subnetwork\nwith certain topological features. This connection is exploited to show that\nthese structures generate all kinetics-independent RPA properties, allowing us\nto systematically identify all RPA properties by enumerating these subnetworks.\nAn efficient method is developed for this enumeration, and we provide a\ncomputational package for this purpose. We pinpoint the integral feedback\ncontrollers that work in concert to realize each RPA property, casting our\nresults into the familiar control-theoretic paradigm of the Internal Model\nPrinciple. We further generalize the regulation problem to the multi-output\nscenario where the target values belong to a manifold of nonzero dimension, and\nprovide a sufficient condition for this. The present work significantly\nadvances our understanding of regulatory mechanisms that lead to RPA in\nendogenous biochemical systems, and it also provides rational design principles\nfor synthetic controllers.

Advances in estimation algorithms have increased the\npractical scope of these models to larger networks, however it is still not\nalways possible to estimate a model without encountering problems of model\nnear-degeneracy, particularly if it is desired to use only simple model\nparameters, rather than more complex parameters designed to overcome the\nproblem of near-degeneracy. Two new network models related to the ERGM, the\nTapered ERGM, and the latent order logistic (LOLOG) model, have recently been\nproposed to overcome this problem. In this work I illustrate the application of\nthe Tapered ERGM and the LOLOG to a set of biological networks, including\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, gene regulatory networks, and\nneural networks. I find that the Tapered ERGM and the LOLOG are able to\nestimate models for networks for which it was not possible to estimate a\nconventional ERGM, and are able to do so using only simple model parameters. In\nthe case of two neural networks where data on the spatial position of neurons\nis available, this allows the estimation of models including terms for spatial\ndistance and triangle structures, allowing triangle motif statistical\nsignificance to be estimated while accounting for the effect of spatial\nproximity on connection probability. For some larger networks, however, Tapered\nERGM and LOLOG estimation was not possible in practical time, while\nconventional ERGM models were able to be estimated only by using the\nEquilibrium Expectation (EE) algorithm.\n",

The processes in sub-cellular compartments are described\nby an arbitrary number of processing stages, thus accounting for a\nsignificantly finer molecular description of gene expression than conventional\nmodels such as the telegraph, two-stage and three-stage models of gene\nexpression. We use two distinct tools, queueing theory and model reduction\nusing the slow-scale linear-noise approximation, to derive exact or approximate\nanalytic expressions for the moments or distributions of nuclear mRNA,\ncytoplasmic mRNA and protein fluctuations, as well as lower bounds for their\nFano factors in steady-state conditions.

Kinetic proofreading\n(KPR) is a key mechanism enhancing signaling specificity through time-delayed\nsteps, although its effectiveness is debated due to intrinsic noise potentially\nreducing signal fidelity. In this study, we reformulate the theory of kinetic\nproofreading (KPR) by convolving multiple intermediate states into a single\nstate and then define an overall \"processing\" time required to traverse these\nstates. This simplification allows us to succinctly describe kinetic\nproofreading in terms of a single waiting time parameter, facilitating a more\ndirect evaluation and comparison of KPR performance across different biological\ncontexts such as DNA replication and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We find\nthat loss of fidelity for longer proofreading steps relies on the specific\nstrategy of information extraction and show that in the first-passage time\n(FPT) discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps can exponentially\nimprove the accuracy of KPR at the cost of speed. Thus, KPR can still be an\neffective discrimination mechanism in the high noise regime. However, in a\nproduct concentration-based discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps\ndo not necessarily lead to an increase in performance. However, by introducing\nactivation thresholds on product concentrations, can we decompose the\nproduct-based strategy into a series of FPT based strategies to better resolve\nthe subtleties of KPR-mediated product discrimination.

Enhancers, short DNA sequences (50-150\nbase pairs), help coordinate these cascades by attracting regulatory proteins\nto enhance the transcription of distal genes by binding to promoters. In\nhumans, there are hundreds of thousands of enhancers dispersed across the\ngenome, which poses a challenging coordination task to prevent unintended gene\nactivation. To mitigate this problem, the genome contains additional DNA\nelements, insulators, that block enhancer-promoter interactions. However, there\nis an open problem with how the insulation works, especially as\nenhancer-insulator pairs may be separated by millions of base pairs. Based on\nrecent empirical data from Hi-C experiments, this paper proposes a new\nmechanism that challenges the common paradigm that rests on specific\ninsulator-insulator interactions.

Mathematically, the notion of\nhomeostasis can be formalized in terms of an input-output function that maps\nthe parameter representing the external disturbance to the output variable that\nmust be kept within a fairly narrow range. This observation inspired the\nintroduction of the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis, namely, the derivative\nof the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. This point of view\nallows for the application of methods from singularity theory to characterize\ninfinitesimal homeostasis points (i.e. critical points of the input-output\nfunction). In this paper we review the infinitesimal approach to the study of\nhomeostasis in input-output networks. An input-output network is a network with\ntwo distinguished nodes `input' and `output', and the dynamics of the network\ndetermines the corresponding input-output function of the system. This class of\ndynamical systems provides an appropriate framework to study homeostasis and\nseveral important biological systems can be formulated in this context.\nMoreover, this approach, coupled to graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial\nmatrix theory, provides a systematic way for classifying different types of\nhomeostasis (homeostatic mechanisms) in input-output networks, in terms of the\nnetwork topology. In turn, this leads to new mathematical concepts, such as,\nhomeostasis subnetworks, homeostasis patterns, homeostasis mode interaction.

Boolean networks are\npopular in systems biology due to their ability to model long-term biological\nphenotypes within a qualitative, predictive framework. Boolean networks model\nphenotypes as attractors, which are closely linked to minimal trap spaces\n(inescapable hypercubes in the system's state space). In biological\napplications, attractors and minimal trap spaces are typically in one-to-one\ncorrespondence. However, this correspondence is not guaranteed: motif-avoidant\nattractors (MAAs) that lie outside minimal trap spaces are possible.\n  MAAs are rare and (despite recent efforts) poorly understood. Here we\nsummarize the current state of knowledge regarding MAAs and present several\nnovel observations regarding their response to node deletion reductions and\nlinear extensions of edges. We conduct large-scale computational studies on an\nensemble of 14,000 models derived from published Boolean models of biological\nsystems, and more than 100 million Random Boolean Networks. Our findings\nquantify the rarity of MAAs (in particular, we found no MAAs in the biological\nmodels), but highlight the role of network reduction in introducing MAAs into\nthe dynamics. We also show that MAAs are fragile to linear extensions: in\nsparse networks, even a single linear node can disrupt virtually all MAAs.\nMotivated by this observation, we improve the upper bound on the number of\ndelays needed to disrupt a motif-avoidant attractor.\n",

Our case studies on XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear\nregression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains\naccuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species\nand (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of\nthe noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function.

A fundamental property of networks is that the perturbation of\none node can affect other nodes, in a process that may cause the entire or\nsubstantial part of the system to change behavior and possibly collapse. Recent\nresearch in metabolic and food-web networks has demonstrated the concept that\nnetwork damage caused by external perturbations can often be mitigated or\nreversed by the application of compensatory perturbations. Compensatory\nperturbations are constrained to be physically admissible and amenable to\nimplementation on the network. However, the systematic identification of\ncompensatory perturbations that conform to these constraints remains an open\nproblem. Here, we present a method to construct compensatory perturbations that\ncan control the fate of general networks under such constraints. Our approach\naccounts for the full nonlinear behavior of real complex networks and can bring\nthe system to a desirable target state even when this state is not directly\naccessible. Applications to genetic networks show that compensatory\nperturbations are effective even when limited to a small fraction of all nodes\nin the network and that they are far more effective when limited to the\nhighest-degree nodes.

Hubs\nand in particular, party hubs of yeast protein-protein interaction networks had\na large influence to convert the cooperation of other nodes to defection.\nSimulations on methionyl-tRNA synthetase protein structure network indicated an\nincreased influence of nodes belonging to intra-protein signaling pathways on\nbreaking cooperation. The efficiency of single, initially defecting nodes to\nconvert the cooperation of other nodes to defection in social dilemma games may\nbe an important measure to predict the importance of nodes in the integration\nand regulation of complex systems. Game centrality may help to design more\nefficient interventions to cellular networks (in forms of drugs), to ecosystems\nand social networks.

The SAC delays mitotic progression by preventing activation of\nthe ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) or cyclosome; whose\nactivation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid separation marking the\ntransition into anaphase. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which contains\nCdc20 as a subunit, binds stably to the APC/C. Compelling evidence by Izawa and\nPines (Nature 2014; 10.1038/nature13911) indicates that the MCC can inhibit a\nsecond Cdc20 that has already bound and activated the APC/C. Whether or not MCC\nper se is sufficient to fully sequester Cdc20 and inhibit APC/C remains\nunclear. Here, a dynamic model for SAC regulation in which the MCC binds a\nsecond Cdc20 was constructed. This model is compared to the MCC, and the\nMCC-and-BubR1 (dual inhibition of APC) core model variants and subsequently\nvalidated with experimental data from the literature. By using ordinary\nnonlinear differential equations and spatial simulations, it is shown that the\nSAC works sufficiently to fully sequester Cdc20 and completely inhibit APC/C\nactivity.

We make use of the Koopman observability gramian to develop an\nalgorithm for optimal sensor (or reporter) placement for discrete time\nnonlinear dynamical systems to ease the difficulty of design of the promoter\nlibrary. This ease is enabled due to the fact that the Koopman operator\nrepresents the evolution of a nonlinear system linearly by lifting the states\nto an infinite-dimensional space of observables. The Koopman framework ideally\ndemands high temporal resolution, but data in biology are often sampled\nsparsely in time. Therefore we compute what we call the temporally fine-grained\nKoopman operator from the temporally coarse-grained Koopman operator, the\nlatter of which is identified from the sparse data. The optimal placement of\nsensors then corresponds to maximizing the observability of the fine-grained\nsystem. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simulation example of a circadian\noscillator.\n",

In this paper, computation capacity of signaling\nnetworks is introduced as a fundamental limit on signaling capability and\nperformance of such networks. The computation capacity measures the maximum\nnumber of computable inputs, that is, the maximum number of input values for\nwhich the correct functional output values can be recovered from the erroneous\nnetwork outputs, when the network contains some dysfunctional molecules. This\ncontrasts with the conventional communication capacity that measures instead\nthe maximum number of input values that can be correctly distinguished based on\nthe erroneous network outputs.\n  The computation capacity is higher than the communication capacity, if the\nnetwork response function is not a one-to-one function of the input signals. By\nexplicitly incorporating the effect of signaling errors that result in the\nnetwork dysfunction, the computation capacity provides more information about\nthe network and its malfunction. Two examples of signaling networks are studied\nhere, one regulating caspase3 and another regulating NFkB, for which\ncomputation and communication capacities are analyzed. Higher computation\ncapacities are observed for both networks.

The\nconstrained optimization of evolutionarily-motivated objective functions like\nthe growth rate has emerged as the key theoretical assumption for the study of\nbacterial metabolism. While conceptually and practically useful in many\nsituations, the idea that certain functions are optimized is hard to validate\nin data. Moreover, it is not always clear how optimality can be reconciled with\nthe high degree of single-cell variability observed in experiments within\nmicrobial populations.

While no clear objective function emerges, we\nfind that, as the medium gets richer, the fitness and inferred variability for\nEscherichia coli populations follow and slowly approach the theoretically\noptimal bound defined by minimal reduction of variability at given fitness.\nThese results suggest that bacterial metabolism may be crucially shaped by a\npopulation-level trade-off between growth and heterogeneity.\n",

        "summary": "  Most natural and engineered information-processing systems transmit\ninformation via signals that vary in time. Computing the information\ntransmission rate or the information encoded in the temporal characteristics of\nthese signals, requires the mutual information between the input and output\nsignals as a function of time, i.e. between the input and output trajectories.\nYet, this is notoriously difficult because of the high-dimensional nature of\nthe trajectory space, and all existing techniques require approximations. We\npresent an exact Monte Carlo technique called Path Weight Sampling (PWS) that,\nfor the first time, makes it possible to compute the mutual information between\ninput and output trajectories for any stochastic system that is described by a\nmaster equation. The principal idea is to use the master equation to evaluate\nthe exact conditional probability of an individual output trajectory for a\ngiven input trajectory, and average this via Monte Carlo sampling in trajectory\nspace to obtain the mutual information. We present three variants of PWS, which\nall generate the trajectories using the standard stochastic simulation\nalgorithm. While Direct PWS is a brute-force method, Rosenbluth-Rosenbluth PWS\nexploits the analogy between signal trajectory sampling and polymer sampling,\nand Thermodynamic Integration PWS is based on a reversible work calculation in\ntrajectory space. PWS also makes it possible to compute the mutual information\nbetween input and output trajectories for systems with hidden internal states\nas well as systems with feedback from output to input. Applying PWS to the\nbacterial chemotaxis system, consisting of 182 coupled chemical reactions,\ndemonstrates not only that the scheme is highly efficient, but also that the\nnumber of receptor clusters is much smaller than hitherto believed, while their\nsize is much larger.\n",

A holistic study of the growing chemistry\nliterature is, therefore, required that focuses on understanding the recent\ntrends and extrapolating them into possible future trajectories. To this end,\nseveral network theory-based studies have been reported that use a directed\ngraph representation of chemical reactions. Here, we perform a study based on\nrepresenting chemical reactions as hypergraphs where the hyperedges represent\nchemical reactions and nodes represent the participating molecules. We use a\nstandard reactions dataset to construct a hypernetwork and report its\nstatistics such as degree distributions, average path length, assortativity or\ndegree correlations, PageRank centrality, and graph-based clusters (or\ncommunities). We also compute each statistic for an equivalent directed graph\nrepresentation of reactions to draw parallels and highlight differences between\nthe two. To demonstrate the AI applicability of hypergraph reaction\nrepresentation, we generate dense hypergraph embeddings and use them in the\nreaction classification problem. We conclude that the hypernetwork\nrepresentation is flexible, preserves reaction context, and uncovers hidden\ninsights that are otherwise not apparent in a traditional directed graph\nrepresentation of chemical reactions.\n",

In [Shinar, Alon, and Feinberg. \"Sensitivity and robustness in\nchemical reaction networks.\" SIAM J App Math (2009): 977-998.], the responses\nof CRN to changes in the linear conserved quantities, called sensitivities,\nwere studied in and the question of how to construct absolute, i.e.,\nbasis-independent, sensitivities was raised. In this article, by applying\ninformation geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to\ntrack how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes\nof all the other chemicals within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix\nof absolute sensitivites. A linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of\nabsolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN is derived via a Cramer-Rao\nbound for CRN, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic\nsteady states and the exponential family of probability distributions.\n",

It is most natural to think of\nthe interacting compartments as ``cells'' that can appear, degrade, split, and\neven merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying\nstochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including\nthose associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the\ncompartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational\nmethods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with\nrespect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational\nmethods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic\nreaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in\nthe RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov\ntransformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of\ncoupling methods for the implementation of finite differences. We provide\nseveral numerical examples and conclude that the method associated with the\n``Split Coupling'' provides the most efficient algorithm.

Maintenance of normal system function depends not only on\nthe stoichiometry of the underlying interrelated components, but also on a\nmultitude of kinetic parameters. For given parameter values, recent findings\nhave aimed at characterizing the property of the system components to exhibit\nsame concentrations in the resulting steady states, termed absolute\nconcentration robustness (ACR). However, the existing method for determining\nsystem components exhibiting ACR is applicable only to one class of mass-action\nnetworks for which this property can be confirmed, but not discarded. Here we\ndesign a new method which relies on biochemical network decompositions into\nsubnetworks, called elementary flux modes, to identify ACR in a broader class\nof mass-action networks by using only the given stoichiometry. This approach\nreduces the problem of determining ACR to that of solving parameterized systems\nof linear equations, rendering it amenable to networks of larger sizes. Our\nunified framework will be helpful in analyzing this biologically important type\nof robustness as well as detection of novel systemic properties independent of\nthe kinetic parameters for more complex biochemical networks.\n",
