A new experiment on a model system has shown a\nspectacular budding process with the expulsion of one or two rafts when one\nintroduces proteins on the membrane. In this paper, we give a physical\ninterpretation of the budding of the raft phase. An approach based on the\nenergy of the system including the presence of proteins is used to derive a\nshape equation and to study possible instabilities. This model shows two\ndifferent situations which are strongly dependent on the nature of the\nproteins: a regime of easy budding when the proteins are strongly coupled to\nthe membrane and a regime of difficult budding.\n",

By computing\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent, the spatial correlation function, and the\naverage transient lifetime, we classify it as a weak turbulence with transient\nnature. Virtual heterogeneities generating unstable fast oscillations are the\nmechanism of the transient turbulence. In the presence of wavenumber\ninstability, unstable oscillations can be reinjected leading to stationary\nturbulence. We also find similar turbulence in a cell cycle model. These\nfindings suggest that weak turbulence may be universal in biochemical\nbirhythmic media exhibiting cyclic fold bifurcations.\n",

Using computer simulations\nthe reasons for this phenomena had been unveiled and shown to be attributed to\ntwo antagonistic nucleation processes during the polymerization of the cell's\nactin cytoskeleton : the (ordinary) spontaneous nucleation and the dendritic\nnucleation processes. Whereas spontaneous nucleations generate actin filaments\ngrowing in different directions and hence create motions in random directions,\ndendritic nucleations provide a unidirectional growth. Since dendritic growth\nexhibits stochastic fluctuations, spontaneous nucleation may eventually compete\nor even dominate, which results in a reorientation of filament growth and hence\na new direction of cell motion.

Internal noise stemming from the\nstochastic dynamics of individual ion channels is known to affect the\ncollective properties of the whole ion channel cluster. For example, there\nexists an optimal size of the membrane patch for which the internal noise alone\ncauses a regular spontaneous generation of action potentials. In addition to\nvarying the size of ion channel clusters, living organisms may adapt the\ndensities of ion channels in order to optimally regulate the spontaneous\nspiking activity. The influence of channel block on the excitability of a\nmembrane patch of certain size is twofold: First, a variation of ion channel\ndensities primarily yields a change of the conductance level. Second, a\ndown-regulation of working ion channels always increases the channel noise.\nWhile the former effect dominates in the case of sodium channel block resulting\nin a reduced spiking activity, the latter enhances the generation of\nspontaneous action potentials in the case of a tailored potassium channel\nblocking. Moreover, by blocking some portion of either potassium or sodium ion\nchannels, it is possible to either increase or to decrease the regularity of\nthe spike train.\n",

While stochastic simulations are a practical way to realise the CME,\nanalytical approximations offer more insight into the influence of noise.\nTowards that end, the two-moment approximation (2MA) is a promising addition to\nthe established analytical approaches including the chemical Langevin equation\n(CLE) and the related linear noise approximation (LNA). The 2MA approach\ndirectly tracks the mean and (co)variance which are coupled in general. This\ncoupling is not obvious in CME and CLE and ignored by LNA and conventional ODE\nmodels. We extend previous derivations of 2MA by allowing a) non-elementary\nreactions and b) relative concentrations. Often, several elementary reactions\nare approximated by a single step. Furthermore, practical situations often\nrequire the use relative concentrations. We investigate the applicability of\nthe 2MA approach to the well established fission yeast cell cycle model.

At the\nheart of our model is the assumption that the rotor protein complex can exist\nin two conformational states corresponding to the two respective rotation\ndirections, and that switching between these states depends on interactions\nwith the stator proteins. This naturally couples the switching dynamics to the\nrotation dynamics, making the switch sensitive to torque and speed.

Since the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells is dependent\non the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of\npromoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration which\nis difficult to quantify directly. Here we develop a simple physical model\ndescribing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs\ntranscribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to\nDNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli\nallow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce\nthe free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to\npredict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive\n(unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent\nregulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in\ntranscription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth\nrates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene\nexpression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP\nexpression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the\ncase of the stringent response following amino acid starvation, we can evaluate\nthe plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control\nproposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and\nbiosynthetic operons.\n",

In accordance\nwith the prevailing model of LD formation, we assumed that neutral lipids\noil-out between the membrane leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),\nresulting in LD that bud-off when a critical size is reached.\n  Mathematically, LD were modeled as spherical protuberances in an otherwise\nplanar ER membrane. We estimated the local phospholipid composition, and\ncalculated the change in elastic free energy of the membrane caused by nascent\nLD. Based on this model calculation, we found a gradual demixing of lipids in\nthe membrane leaflet that goes along with an increase in surface curvature at\nthe site of LD formation. During demixing, the phospholipid monolayer was able\nto gain energy during LD growth, which suggested that the formation of curved\ninterfaces was supported by or even driven by lipid demixing. In addition, we\nshow that demixing is thermodynamically necessary as LD cannot bud-off\notherwise.\n  In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae our model predicts a LD bud-off\ndiameter of about 13 nm. This diameter is far below the experimentally\ndetermined size of typical yeast LD. Thus, we concluded that if the standard\nmodel of LD formation is valid, LD biogenesis is a two step process.

The dependence on these mechanical parameters is given to the\ndiscrete-state model by fitting its transition rates to the continuous-angle\nmodel of P. Gaspard and E. Gerritsma [J. Theor.

In this way,\nkinetic and thermodynamic properties of the F1 motor are obtained such as the\nMichaelis-Menten dependence of the rotation and ATP consumption rates on ATP\nconcentration and its extension in the presence of ADP and Pi, their\ndependences on friction and external torque, as well as the chemical and\nmechanical thermodynamic efficiencies.\n",

We express the stochastic\nevolution of the oscillatory system as a map from the probability distribution\nof maximum polymer length in one period of the oscillation to the probability\ndistribution of maximum polymer length half a period later and solve for the\nfixed point of the map with a combined analytical and numerical technique. This\nsolution gives a theoretical prediction of the distributions of both lengths of\nthe polar MinD zones and periods of oscillations -- both of which are\nexperimentally measurable.

In a recent study,\na mycobacterial population of M. smegmatis was shown to develop phenotypic\nheterogeneity under nutrient depletion. The observed heterogeneity is in the\nform of a bimodal distribution of the expression levels of the Green\nFluorescent Protein (GFP) as reporter with the gfp fused to the promoter of the\nrel gene. The stringent response pathway is initiated in the subpopulation with\nhigh rel activity.In the present study, we characterize quantitatively the\nsingle cell promoter activity of the three key genes, namely, mprA, sigE and\nrel, in the stringent response pathway with gfp as the reporter. The origin of\nbimodality in the GFP distribution lies in two stable expression states, i.e.,\nbistability. We develop a theoretical model to study the dynamics of the\nstringent response pathway. The model incorporates a recently proposed\nmechanism of bistability based on positive feedback and cell growth retardation\ndue to protein synthesis.

Microtubules undergo so-called\ncatastrophes, which are abrupt stochastic transitions from a growing to a\nshrinking state, and rescues, which are transitions back to the growing state.\nMicrotubules can exert pushing or polymerization forces on an obstacle, such as\nan elastic barrier if the growing end is in contact with the obstacle. We use\ndynamical mean-field theory and stochastic simulations to analyze a model where\neach microtubule undergoes catastrophes and rescues and where microtubules\ninteract by force sharing. For zero rescue rate, cooperative growth terminates\nin a collective catastrophe. The maximal polymerization force before\ncatastrophes grows linearly with N for small N or a stiff elastic barrier, in\nagreement with available experimental results, whereas it crosses over to a\nlogarithmic dependence for larger N or a soft elastic barrier. For a nonzero\nrescue rate and a soft elastic barrier, the dynamics becomes oscillatory with\nboth collective catastrophe and rescue events, which are part of a robust limit\ncycle. Both the average and maximal polymerization forces then grow linearly\nwith N, and we investigate their dependence on tubulin on-rates and rescue\nrates, which can be involved in cellular regulation mechanisms. We further\ninvestigate the robustness of the collective catastrophe and rescue\noscillations with respect to different catastrophe models.\n",

Two of the three methods that\nwill be discussed in detail have been previously reported in the literature;\nthe two-regime method (TRM) and the compartment-placement method (CPM). The\nthird method that is introduced and analysed in this paper is the ghost cell\nmethod (GCM). Presented is a comparison of sources of error. The convergent\nproperties of this error are studied as the time step $\\Delta t$ (for updating\nthe molecular-based part of the model) approaches zero. It is found that the\nerror behaviour depends on another fundamental computational parameter $h$, the\ncompartment size in the mesoscopic part of the model. Two important limiting\ncases, which appear in applications, are considered: (i) \\Delta t approaches 0\nand h is fixed; and (ii) \\Delta t approaches 0 and h approaches 0 such that\n\\Delta t/h^2 is fixed. The error for previously developed approaches (the TRM\nand CPM) converges to zero only in the limiting case (ii), but not in case (i).\nIt is shown that the error of the GCM converges in the limiting case (i).

Aster motility and dynamics is vital for genome\nstability, cell division, polarization and differentiation. Asters move either\ntowards the cell center or away from it. Here, we focus on the centering\nmechanism in a membrane independent system of Xenopus cytoplasmic egg extracts.\nUsing live microscopy and single particle tracking, we find that asters move\ntowards chromatinized DNA structures. The velocity and directionality profiles\nsuggest a random walk with drift directed towards DNA. We have developed a\ntheoretical model that can explain this movement as a result of a gradient of\nMT length dynamics and MT gliding on immobilized dynein motors. In simulations,\nthe antagonistic action of the motor species on the radial array of MTs leads\nto a tug-of-war purely due to geometric considerations and aster motility\nresembles a directed random-walk. Additionally our model predicts that aster\nvelocities do not change greatly with varying initial distance from DNA. The\nmovement of asymmetric asters becomes increasingly super-diffusive with\nincreasing motor density, but for symmetric asters it becomes less\nsuper-diffusive. The transition of symmetric asters from superdiffusive to\ndiffusive mobility is the result of number fluctuations in bound motors in the\ntug-of-war. Overall, our model is in good agreement with experimental data in\nXenopus cytoplasmic extracts and predicts novel features of the collective\neffects of motor-MT interactions.\n",

The\ninteraction between kinetochores and microtubules is highly dynamic with\nfrequent attachments and detachments. However, it remains unclear how\nchromosome bi-orientation is achieved with such accuracy in such a dynamic\nprocess.\n  Results: To gain new insight into this essential process, we have developed a\nsimple mathematical model of kinetochore-microtubule interactions during cell\ndivision in general, i.e. both mitosis and meiosis. Firstly, the model reveals\nthat the balance between attachment and detachment probabilities of kMTs is\ncrucial for correct chromosome bi-orientation. With the right balance,\nincorrect attachments are resolved spontaneously into correct bi-oriented\nconformations while an imbalance leads to persistent errors. In addition, the\nmodel explains why errors are more commonly found in the first meiotic division\n(meiosis I) than in mitosis and how a faulty conformation can evade the spindle\nassembly checkpoint, which may lead to a chromosome loss.\n  Conclusions: The proposed model, despite its simplicity, helps us understand\none of the primary causes of chromosomal instability - aberrant\nkinetochore-microtubule interactions. The model reveals that chromosome\nbi-orientation is a probabilistic self-organization, rather than a\nsophisticated process of error detection and correction.\n",

Mathematical models for virus self-assembly usually\nassume that the bonds leading to cluster formation have constant reactivity\nover the time course of assembly (direct assembly). In some cases, however,\nbinding sites between the capsomers have been reported to be activated during\nthe self-assembly process (hierarchical assembly). In order to study possible\nadvantages of such hierarchical schemes for icosahedral virus capsid assembly,\nwe use Brownian dynamics simulations of a patchy particle model that allows us\nto switch binding sites on and off during assembly. For T1 viruses, we\nimplement a hierarchical assembly scheme where inter-capsomer bonds become\nactive only if a complete pentamer has been assembled. We find direct assembly\nto be favorable for reversible bonds allowing for repeated structural\nreorganizations, while hierarchical assembly is favorable for strong bonds with\nsmall dissociation rate, as this situation is less prone to kinetic trapping.\nHowever, at the same time it is more vulnerable to monomer starvation during\nthe final phase. Increasing the number of initial monomers does have only a\nweak effect on these general features. The differences between the two assembly\nschemes become more pronounced for more complex virus geometries, as shown here\nfor T3 viruses, which assemble through homogeneous pentamers and heterogeneous\nhexamers in the hierarchical scheme.

From which many meaningful properties, such as the appearance of\ndomain wall (defined as the borderline of high density and low density of motor\nprotein along motion track) and boundary layers, can be obtained. However, it\nis biologically obvious that a single track may be occupied by different motor\nspecies. So previous studies based on TASEP of one particle species are not\nreasonable enough to find more detailed properties of the motion of motors\nalong a single track. To address this problem, TASEP with two particle species\nis discussed in this study. Theoretical methods to get densities of each\nparticle species are provided. Using these methods, phase transition related\nproperties of particle densities are obtained. Our analysis show that domain\nwall and boundary layer of single species densities always appear\nsimultaneously with those of the total particle density. The height of domain\nwall of total particle density is equal to the summation of those of single\nspecies. Phase diagrams for typical model parameters are also presented.

Both in signaling networks and\ngene regulation there are two main mechanisms by which the concentration can be\nencoded internally: amplitude modulation (AM), where the absolute concentration\nof an internal signaling molecule encodes the stimulus, and frequency\nmodulation (FM), where the period between successive bursts represents the\nstimulus. Although both mechanisms have been observed in biological systems,\nthe question of when it is beneficial for cells to use either AM or FM is\nlargely unanswered. Here, we first consider a simple model for a single\nreceptor (or ion channel), which can either signal continuously whenever a\nligand is bound, or produce a burst in signaling molecule upon receptor\nbinding. We find that bursty signaling is more accurate than continuous\nsignaling only for sufficiently fast dynamics. This suggests that modulation\nbased on bursts may be more common in signaling networks than in gene\nregulation. We then extend our model to multiple receptors, where continuous\nand bursty signaling are equivalent to AM and FM respectively, finding that AM\nis always more accurate. This implies that the reason some cells use FM is\nrelated to factors other than accuracy, such as the ability to coordinate\nexpression of multiple genes or to implement threshold crossing mechanisms.\n",

Transcription\nFactors (TFs) search for their DNA promoter target by alternating between bulk\ndiffusion and sliding along the DNA, a mechanism known as facilitated\ndiffusion. We study a facilitated diffusion framework with switching between\nthree search modes: a bulk mode and two sliding modes triggered by\nconformational changes between two protein conformations. In one conformation\n(search mode) the TF interacts unspecifically with the DNA backbone resulting\nin fast sliding. In the other conformation (recognition mode) it interacts\nspecifically and strongly with DNA base pairs leading to slow displacement.\nFrom the bulk, a TF associates with the DNA at a random position that is\ncorrelated with the previous dissociation point, which implicitly is a function\nof the DNA structure. The target affinity depends on the conformation. We\nderive exact expressions for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to bind to the\npromoter and the conditional probability to bind before detaching when arriving\nat the promoter site. We systematically explore the parameter space and compare\nvarious search scenarios. We compare our results with experimental data for the\ndimeric Lac repressor search in E.Coli bacteria. We find that a coiled DNA\nconformation is absolutely necessary for a fast MFPT. With frequent spontaneous\nconformational changes, a fast search time is achieved even when a TF becomes\nimmobilized in the recognition state due to the specific bindings.

A large number\nof experimental and theoretical investigations have been devoted to uncovering\nthe molecular description of these phenomena, but many aspects of the\nmechanisms of protein search for the targets on DNA remain not well understood.\nOne of the most intriguing problems is the role of multiple targets in protein\nsearch dynamics.

Our method is based on a discrete-state stochastic\napproach that takes into account most relevant physical-chemical processes and\nleads to fully analytical description of all dynamic properties. Specifically,\nsystems with two and three targets have been explicitly investigated. It is\nfound that multiple targets in most cases accelerate the search in comparison\nwith a single target situation. However, the acceleration is not always\nproportional to the number of targets. Surprisingly, there are even situations\nwhen it takes longer to find one of the multiple targets in comparison with the\nsingle target. It depends on the spatial position of the targets, distances\nbetween them, average scanning lengths of protein molecules on DNA, and the\ntotal DNA lengths. Physical-chemical explanations of observed results are\npresented. Our predictions are compared with experimental observations as well\nas with results from a continuum theory for the protein search.

Then, we introduce a\nnon-traditional stack run encoding scheme with 5 symbols for detecting\ntransition states as well as to encode MT experimental data.

One of the added advantages of including peak information\nwhile encoding being that it enables to detect the peaks efficiently and\nencodes them simultaneously in the wavelet domain without having the need to do\nfurther processing after the decoding stage. Experimental results show that\nusing this form of non-traditional stack run encoding has better compression\nand reconstruction performance as opposed to traditional stack run encoding and\nrun length encoding schemes. Parameters for MTs modeled in the three states are\nestimated and is shown to closely approximate original MT data for lower\ncompression rates.

We develop the\ntheory and present a practical implementation for the case of the universal\nsecond messenger, calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) and single-wavelength dyes that increase\ntheir fluorescence upon Ca$^{2+}$ binding. We validate the approach with\nexperiments performed in aqueous solutions containing Ca$^{2+}$ and Fluo4\ndextran (both in its High and Low Affinity versions). Performing FCS\nexperiments with tetramethylrhodamine-dextran in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we\ninfer the corresponding free diffusion coefficients in the cytosol of these\ncells. Our approach can be extended to other physiologically relevant\nreaction-diffusion systems to quantify biophysical parameters that determine\nthe dynamics of various variables of interest.\n",

The motion of these particles can\nbe modeled as a one-dimensional movement along an ordered sequence of sites.\nThe biological particles (e.g., ribosomes, RNAPs, phosphate groups, motor\nproteins) have volume and cannot surpass one another. In some cases, there is a\npreferred direction of movement along the track, but in general the movement\nmay be two-directional, and furthermore the particles may attach or detach from\nvarious regions along the tracks (e.g. ribosomes may drop off the mRNA molecule\nbefore reaching a stop codon). We derive a new deterministic mathematical model\nfor such transport phenomena that may be interpreted as the dynamic mean-field\napproximation of an important model from mechanical statistics called the\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with Langmuir kinetics. Using tools\nfrom the theory of monotone dynamical systems and contraction theory we show\nthat the model admits a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. This\nmeans that the occupancy in all the sites along the lattice converges to a\nsteady-state value that depends on the parameters but not on the initial\nconditions. We also show that the model entrains (or phase locks) to periodic\nexcitations in any of its forward, backward, attachment, or detachment rates.\nWe demonstrate an application of this phenomenological transport model for\nanalyzing the effect of ribosome drop off in mRNA translation. One may perhaps\nexpect that drop off from a jammed site may increase the total flow by reducing\ncongestion. Our results show that this is not true. Drop off has a substantial\neffect on the flow, yet always leads to a reduction in the steady-state protein\nproduction rate.\n",

Consequently, events that trigger at\ncritical threshold levels of regulatory proteins exhibit stochasticity in their\ntiming. An important contributor to the noise in gene expression is translation\nbursts which correspond to randomness in number of proteins produced in a\nsingle mRNA lifetime. Modeling timing of an event as a first-passage time (FPT)\nproblem, we explore the effect of burst size distribution on event timing.\nTowards this end, the probability density function of FPT is computed for a\ngene expression model with burst size drawn from a generic non-negative\ndistribution. Analytical formulas for FPT moments are provided in terms of\nknown vectors and inverse of a matrix. The effect of burst size distribution is\ninvestigated by looking at how the feedback regulation strategy that minimizes\nnoise in timing around a given time deviates from the case when burst is\ndeterministic. Interestingly, results show that the feedback strategy for\ndeterministic burst case is quite robust to change in burst size distribution,\nand deviations from it are confined to about 20% of the optimal value.

Why are two different mechanisms used to perform the same\nfunction? Systematic analysis, without parameter fitting, of kinetic models of\nthe rotary, alternating access and other possible mechanisms suggest that, when\nthe ratio of protons transported per ATP hydrolyzed exceeds one, the\none-at-a-time proton transport by the rotary mechanism is faster than other\npossible mechanisms across a wide range of driving conditions. When the ratio\nis one, there is no intrinsic difference in the free energy landscape between\nmechanisms, and therefore all mechanisms can exhibit the same kinetic\nperformance. To our knowledge all known rotary pumps have an H+:ATP ratio\ngreater than one, and all known alternating access ATP-driven proton pumps have\na ratio of one. Our analysis suggests a possible explanation for this apparent\nrelationship between coupling ratio and mechanism. When the conditions under\nwhich the pump must operate permit a coupling ratio greater than one, the\nrotary mechanism may have been selected for its kinetic advantage. On the other\nhand, when conditions require a coupling ratio of one or less, the alternating\naccess mechanism may have been selected for other possible advantages resulting\nfrom its structural and functional simplicity.\n",

In the\nbacterium Myxococcus xanthus, the proteins PomX and PomY form a cluster on the\nchromosome that performs a biased random walk to midcell and positively\nregulates cell division there. PomZ, an ATPase, is necessary for tethering of\nthe cluster to the nucleoid and regulates its movement towards midcell. It has\nremained unclear how the cluster dynamics change when the biochemical\nparameters, such as the attachment rates of PomZ to the nucleoid and the\ncluster, the ATP hydrolysis rate of PomZ or the mobility of PomZ dimers\ninteracting with the nucleoid and cluster, are varied. To answer these\nquestions, we investigate a one-dimensional model that includes the nucleoid,\nthe Pom cluster and the PomZ protein. We find that a mechanism based on the\ndiffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the cluster can explain the latter's\nmidnucleoid localization for a broad parameter range. Furthermore, there is an\nATP hydrolysis rate that minimizes the time the cluster needs to reach\nmidnucleoid. If the dynamics of PomZ dimers on the nucleoid is slow relative to\nthe cluster's velocity, we observe oscillatory cluster movements around\nmidnucleoid. To understand midnucleoid localization, we developed a\nsemi-analytical approach that dissects the net movement of the cluster into its\ncomponents: the difference in PomZ fluxes into the cluster from either side,\nthe force exerted by a single PomZ dimer on the cluster and the effective\nfriction coefficient of the cluster. Importantly, we predict that the Pom\ncluster oscillates around midnucleoid if the diffusivity of PomZ on the\nnucleoid is reduced. A similar approach to that applied here may also prove\nuseful for cargo localization in ParABS systems.\n",

Bond graphs\nprovide an explicit energy-based framework for modelling physical systems,\nwhich makes them well-suited for examining conservation within\nelectrophysiological models. We find that the charge conservation laws derived\nin previous studies are examples of the more general concept of a \"conserved\nmoiety\". Conserved moieties explain model drift and non-unique steady states,\ngeneralising the results from previous studies. The bond graph approach\nprovides a rigorous method to check for drift and non-unique steady states in a\nwide range of cardiac action potential models, and can be extended to examine\nbehaviours of other excitable systems.\n",

For this work, the 2013 Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology and Medicine has been awarded to Randy Schekman; the prize is shared\nwith James Rothman and Thomas S{\\\"u}dhof. Here, we present the different\ntrafficking pathways of yeast S. cerevisiae. At the Golgi apparatus newly\nsynthesized proteins are sorted between those transported to the plasma\nmembrane (PM), or the external medium, via the exocytosis or secretory pathway\n(SEC), and those targeted to the vacuole either through endosomes (vacuolar\nprotein sorting or VPS pathway) or directly (alkaline phosphatase or ALP\npathway). Plasma membrane proteins can be internalized by endocytosis (END) and\ntransported to endosomes where they are sorted between those targeted for\nvacuolar degradation and those redirected to the Golgi (recycling or RCY\npathway). Studies in yeast S. cerevisiae allowed the identification of most of\nthe known effectors, protein complexes, and trafficking pathways in eukaryotic\ncells, and most of them are conserved among eukaryotes.\n",

The molecular\nrecognition of ligands by surface receptors is degenerate in many systems\nleading to crosstalk between different receptors. Crosstalk is often thought of\nas a deviation from optimal specific recognition, as the binding of non-cognate\nligands can interfere with the detection of the receptor's cognate ligand,\npossibly leading to a false triggering of a downstream signaling pathway. Here\nwe quantify the optimal precision of sensing the concentrations of multiple\nligands by a collection of promiscuous receptors. We demonstrate that crosstalk\ncan improve precision in concentration sensing and discrimination tasks. To\nachieve superior precision, the additional information about ligand\nconcentrations contained in short binding events of the non-cognate ligand\nshould be exploited. We present a proofreading scheme to realize an approximate\nestimation of multiple ligand concentrations that reaches a precision close to\nthe derived optimal bounds.

Parameters representing\nskeletal muscle myosin, non-muscle myosin IIB, and non-muscle myosin IIA\nrevealed distinct regimes of behavior respectively: (1) large assemblies of\nfast, low-duty ratio motors rapidly build stable forces over a large range of\nenvironmental stiffness, (2) ensembles of slow, high-duty ratio motors serve as\nhigh-affinity cross-links with force build-up times that exceed physiological\ntimescales, and (3) small assemblies of low-duty ratio motors operating at\nintermediate speeds may respond sharply to changes in mechanical context--at\nlow forces or stiffness, they serve as low affinity cross-links but they can\ntransition to effective force production via the positive feedback mechanism\ndescribed above.

This, in turn, implies\nmaximum Fisher information on angular position about a target nuclear pore\ncomplex (NPR). The cell is simply modeled as spherical, with cell membrane (CM)\ndiameter 10 micron and concentric nuclear membrane (NM) diameter 6 micron. The\nNM contains about 3000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Development requires\nmessenger ligands to travel from the CM-NPC-DNA target binding sites. Ligands\nacquire negative charge by phosphorylation, passing through the cytoplasm over\nNewtonian trajectories toward positively charged NPCs (utilizing positive\nnuclear localization sequences). The CM-NPC channel obeys maximized mean\nprotein flux F and Fisher information I at the NPC, with first-order delta I =\n0 and approximate 2nd-order delta I = 0 stability to environmental\nperturbations. Many of its predictions are confirmed, including the dominance\nof protein pathways of from 1-4 proteins, a 4nm size for the EGFR protein and\nthe approximate flux value F =10^16 proteins/m2-s. After entering the nucleus,\neach protein ultimately delivers its ligand information to a DNA target site\nwith maximum probability, i.e. maximum Kullback-Liebler entropy HKL. In a\nsmoothness limit HKL approaches IDNA/2, so that the total CM-NPC-DNA channel\nobeys maximum Fisher I. Thus maximum information approaches non-equilibrium,\none condition for life.\n",

In\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, there is an ongoing debate regarding the mechanisms\nunderlying this important asymmetry. Currently proposed models suggest it is\nestablished via diffusion, but differ on whether a diffusion barrier is\nnecessary or not. However, no study so far incorporated key aspects to\nsegregation, such as dynamic morphology changes throughout anaphase or plasmids\nsize. Here, we determine the distinct effects and contributions of individual\ncellular variability, plasmid volume and moving boundaries in the asymmetric\nsegregation of plasmids. We do this by measuring cellular nuclear geometries\nand plasmid diffusion rates with confocal microscopy, subsequently\nincorporating this data into a growing domain stochastic spatial simulator. Our\nmodelling and simulations confirms that plasmid asymmetrical inheritance does\nnot require an active barrier to diffusion, and provides a full analysis on\nplasmid size effects.\n",

The Target of\nRapamycin (TOR) pathway is becoming increasingly recognized as a master\nregulator of cell size, however less is known how TOR activity might be coupled\nwith the cell cycle. Here, we establish that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes\ncytokinesis through activation of a Rho GTPase-Rho Kinase (ROCK) signaling\ncascade. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling by depletion of any of its\nnegative regulators: TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, or DEPTOR, induces polyploidy in a\nrapamycin-sensitive manner. mTORC1 hyperactivation-mediated polyploidization\noccurs by a prolonged, but ultimately failed attempt at abcission followed by\nre-fusion. Similar to the effects of ROCK2 overexpression, these mTORC1-driven\naberrant cytokinesis events are accompanied by increased Rho-GTP loading,\nextensive plasma membrane blebbing, and increased actin-myosin contractility,\nall of which can be rescued by either mTORC1 or ROCK inhibition. These results\nprovide evidence for the existence of a novel mTORC1-Rho-ROCK pathway during\ncytokinesis and suggest that mTORC1 might play a critical role in setting the\nsize at which a mammalian cell divides.\n",

        "summary": "  How exponentially growing cells maintain size homeostasis is an important\nfundamental problem. Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered\nthe adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from\nbirth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among\ngenetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic\ncomponent in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder\nprinciple, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically\nexpressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division\ntime is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a\nfixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean\ncell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in\ntiming increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the\ndistribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is\nindependent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in\nexperimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to\ndifferent newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other. The model provides\nfurther insights consistent with experimental observations: the distributions\nof the added volume and the cell-division time when scaled by their respective\nmeans become invariant of the growth rate. Finally, we discuss various\nmodifications to the proposed model that lead to deviations from the adder\nprinciple. In summary, our simple yet elegant model explains key experimental\nfindings and suggests a mechanism for regulating both the mean and fluctuations\nin cell-division timing for size control.\n",

Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling\nforces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn\nconsequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of\nthese forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule\navailability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull.\nImportantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99\ncortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior\ncrescent. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex.\nIndeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the\ncentrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it\nmodulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control,\npredicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent\ncontrolled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic\nprogression. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to\na posterior crescent sets the spindle's final position, reflecting polarity\nthrough the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior\ncrescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity.\nThis novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force\ngenerator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold\nneeded for posterior displacement.

Here we\ndissect a network motif between monomeric (m) and trimeric (t) GTPases\nassembled exclusively in eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms. To this\nend, we develop a system of ordinary differential equations in which these two\nclasses of GTPases are interlinked conditional to their ON/OFF states within a\nmotif through feedforward and feedback loops. We provide formulas for the\nsteady states of the system and perform local stability analysis to investigate\nthe role of the different connections between the GTPase switches. A\nfeedforward from the active mGTPase to the GEF of the tGTPase was sufficient to\nprovide two locally stable states: one where both active/inactive forms of the\nmGTPase can be interpreted as having low concentrations and the other where\nboth m- and tGTPase have high concentrations. When a feedback loop from the GEF\nof the tGTPase to the GAP of the mGTPase was added to the feedforward system,\ntwo other locally stable states emerged, both having the tGTPase inactivated\nand being interpreted as having low active tGTPase concentrations. Finally, the\naddition of a second feedback loop, from the active tGTPase to the GAP of the\nmGTPase, gives rise to a family of steady states parametrized by the inactive\ntGTPase concentrations.

These rates depend on many\n\"local\" factors like the abundance of free ribosomes and tRNA molecules in the\nvicinity of the mRNA molecule. All these factors are stochastic and their\nexperimental measurements are also noisy. An important question is how protein\nproduction in the cell is affected by this considerable variability. We develop\na new theoretical framework for addressing this question by modeling the rates\nas identically and independently distributed random variables and using tools\nfrom random matrix theory to analyze the steady-state production rate. The\nanalysis reveals a principle of universality: the average protein production\nrate depends only on the of the set of possible values that the random variable\nmay attain. This explains how total protein production can be stabilized\ndespite the overwhelming stochasticticity underlying cellular processes.\n",

        "summary": "  Plasmodium falciparum is the parasite that causes the most severe form of\nmalaria. Currently, science has been established about its cellular structures,\nits metabolic processes, and even the molecular structures of its intrinsic\nmembrane proteins responsible for transporting water, nutrient, and waste\nmolecules across the parasite plasma membrane (PPM). I hypothesize that\nPlasmodium falciparum has an Achilles' heel that can be attacked with\nerythritol, the well-known sweetener that is classified as generally safe. Most\norganisms have in their cell membrane two types of water-channel proteins:\naquaporins to maintain hydro-homeostasis across the membrane and\naquaglyceroporins to uptake glycerols etc. In contrast, P. falciparum has only\none type of such proteins---the multi-functional aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP)\nexpressed in the PPM---to do both jobs. Moreover, the parasite also uses PfAQP\nto excrete its metabolic wastes (ammonia included) produced at a very high rate\nin the blood stage. This extremely high efficiency of the bug using one protein\nfor multiple essential tasks makes the parasite fatally vulnerable. Erythritol\nin the blood stream can kill the parasite by clogging up its PfAQP channel that\nneeds to be open for maintaining hydro-homeostasis and for excreting toxic\nwastes across the bug's PPM. In vitro tests are to measure the growth/death\nrate of P. falciparum in blood with various erythritol concentrations. In vivo\nexperiments are to administer groups of infected mice with various doses of\nerythritol and monitor the parasite growth levels from blood samples drawn from\neach group. Clinic trials can be performed to observe the added effects of\nadministering to patients erythritol along with the known drugs because\nerythritol was classified as a safe food ingredient.\n",

In bacteria this task is accomplished by RecA proteins that are\nactive as nucleoprotein filaments formed on single-stranded segments of DNA.

Using a method of first-passage\nprocesses, a full dynamic description of the homology search is presented.

L-type Ca2+ channels\ntrigger release of Ca2+ from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) for cellular\ncontraction, while signalling downstream of Gq coupled receptors stimulates\nCa2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), engaging\nhypertrophic signalling pathways. Modulation of the amplitude, duration, and\nduty cycle of the cytosolic Ca2+ contraction signal, and spatial localisation,\nhave all been proposed to encode this hypertrophic signal. Given current\nknowledge of IP3Rs, we develop a model describing the effect of functional\ninteraction (cross-talk) between RyR and IP3R channels on the Ca2+ transient,\nand examine the sensitivity of the Ca2+ transient shape to properties of IP3R\nactivation. A key result of our study is that IP3R activation increases Ca2+\ntransient duration for a broad range of IP3R properties, but the effect of IP3R\nactivation on Ca2+ transient amplitude is dependent on IP3 concentration.\nFurthermore we demonstrate that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in the cytosol\nincreases the duty cycle of the Ca2+ transient, the fraction of the cycle for\nwhich [Ca2+] is elevated, across a broad range of parameter values and IP3\nconcentrations. When coupled to a model of downstream transcription factor\n(NFAT) activation, we demonstrate that there is a high correspondence between\nthe Ca transient duty cycle and the proportion of activated NFAT in the\nnucleus.

In spite of the efficiency\nof tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; Imatinib), other strategies are explored to\neliminate CML leukemia stem cells, such as calcium pathways. Results: In this\nwork, we showed that Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) and thrombin induced\ncalcium influx were decreased in Bcr-Abl expressing 32d cells (32d-p210). The\n32d-p210 cells showed modified Orai1/STIM1 ratio and reduced TRPC1 expression\nthat could explain SOCE reduction. Decrease in SOCE and thrombin induced\ncalcium entry was associated to reduced Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells\n(NFAT) nucleus translocation in 32d-p210 cells. We demonstrated that SOCE\nblockers enhanced cell mobility of 32d-p210 cells and reduced the proliferation\nrate in both 32d cell lines. TKI treatment slightly reduced the\nthrombin-induced response, but imatinib restored SOCE to the wild type level.\nBcr-Abl is also known to deregulate Protein Kinase C (PKC), which was described\nto modulate calcium entries. We showed that PKC enhances SOCE and thrombin\ninduced calcium entries in control cells while this effect is lost in\nBcr-Abl-expressing cells. Conclusion: The tyrosine kinase activity seems to\nregulate calcium entries probably not directly but through a global cellular\nreorganization involving a PKC pathway. Altogether, calcium entries are\nderegulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and could represent an interesting\ntherapeutic target in combination with TKI.\n",

        "summary": "  RNA thermometers are mRNA strands with a temperature dependent secondary\nstructure: depending on the spatial conformation, the mRNA strand can get\ntranslated (on-state) or can be inaccessible for ribosomes binding (off-state).\nThese have been found in a number of microorganisms (mainly pathogens), where\nthey are used to adaptively regulate the gene expression, in response to\nchanges in the environmental temperature. Besides naturally occurring RNA\nthermometers, synthetic RNA thermometers have been recently designed by\nmodifying their natural counterparts (Hofacker et al., 2003). The newly\ndesigned RNA thermometers are simpler, and exhibit a sharper switching between\noff- and on-states. However, the proposed trial-and-error design procedure has\nnot been algorithmically formalized, and the switching temperature is rigidly\ndetermined by the natural RNA thermometer used as template for the design.\n  We developed a general algorithmic procedure (consensus distribution) for the\ndesign of RNA thermo-switches with a tunable switching temperature that can be\ndecided in advance by the designer. A software tool with a user friendly GUI\nhas been written to automate the design of RNA thermo-switches with a desired\nthreshold temperature. Starting from a natural template, a new RNA thermometer\nhas been designed by our method for a new desired threshold temperature of 32C.\nThe designed RNA thermo-switch has been experimentally validated by using it to\ncontrol the expression of lucifarase. A 9.2 fold increase of luminescence has\nbeen observed between 30C and 37C, whereas between 20C and 30C the luminescence\nincrease is less than 3-fold.\n  This work represents a first step towards the design of flexible and tunable\nRNA thermometers that can be used for a precise control of gene expression\nwithout the need of external chemicals and possibly for temperature\nmeasurements at a nano-scale resolution.\n",

Using the simplest quantum channel model consistent with neuronal\nmembrane voltage-clamp experiments, activation eigenenergies are calculated for\nthe Hodgkin-Huxley K+ and Na+ ion channels.

We consider amino acid starvation, which can result in\nbottlenecks in mRNA translation when ribosomes stall due to lack of resources,\ni.e. tRNAs charged with the missing amino acid. Recent experiments also show\nless obvious effects such as increased charging of other (non-starved) tRNA\nspecies and selective charging of isoaccepting tRNAs. We present a mechanism\nwhich accounts for these observations, and shows that production of some\nproteins can actually increase under starvation.

We develop a model for translation which includes\nthe dynamics of the charging and use of aa-tRNAs, explicitly taking into\naccount the effect of specific codon sequences.

Stiffer\nsubstrates give strongly spread (eventually polarized) cells with strong focal\nadhesions, and stress fibers; very soft substrates give a less developed\ncytoskeleton, and much lower cell spreading. The kinetics of this process of\ncell spreading is studied extensively, and important universal relationships\nare established on how the cell area grows with time. Here we study the\npopulation dynamics of spreading cells, investigating the characteristic\nprocesses involved in cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the\nindividual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the\nsubstrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is\nobserved. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time\nstatistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier\ndG=19 kcal/mol, while the early-time kinetics follows a power law $t^5$. This\nimplies that the rate of spreading depends on an internal process of\nadhesion-mechanosensing complex assembly and activation: the operational\ncomplex must have 5 component proteins, and the last process in the sequence\n(which we believe is the activation of focal adhesion kinase) is controlled by\nthe binding energy dG.\n",

This unusual cell response\noccurs if a first pulse is followed by a second pulse with opposite polarity.\nPossibly universal, BPC presently lacks a mechanistic explanation. Multiple\nversions of the \"standard model\" of cell electroporation (EP) fail to account\nfor BPC. Here we show, for the first time, how an extension of the standard\nmodel can account for a key experimental observation that essentially defines\nBPC: the amount of a tracer that enters a cell, and how tracer influx can be\ndecreased by the second part of a bipolar pulse. The extended model can also\naccount for the recovery of BPC wherein the extent of BPC is diminished if the\nspacing between the first and second pulses is increased. Our approach is\nreverse engineering, meaning that we identify and introduce an additional\nbiophysical mechanism that allows pore transport to change. We hypothesize that\noccluding molecules from outside the membrane enter or relocate within a pore.\nSignificantly, the additional mechanism is fundamental and general, involving a\ncombination of partitioning and hindrance. Molecules near the membrane can\nenter pores to block transport of tracer molecules while still passing small\nions (+/- 1) that govern electrical behavior.

In particular, the\nrelation between the cell's doubling time and the ribosome assembly time is not\nknown. Here we develop a model that connects growth rate to ribosome assembly\ntime and show that the existence of a self-assembly step increases the overall\ngrowth rate, because during ribosome self-assembly existing ribosomes can start\na new round of reproduction, by making a new batch of ribosomal proteins prior\nto the completion of the previous round. This overlapping of ribosome\nreproduction cycles increases growth rate beyond the serial-limit that is\ntypically assumed to hold. Using recent data from ribosome profiling and well\nknown measurements of the average translation rate, rigid bounds on the in-vivo\nribosome self-assembly time are set, which are robust to the assumptions\nregarding the biological noises involved. At 21 minutes doubling time, the\nribosome assembly time is found to be approximately 6 minutes --- three fold\nlarger than the common estimate. We further use our model to explain the\ndetrimental effect of a recently discovered ribosome assembly inhibitor drug,\nand predict the effect of limiting the expression of ribosome assembly\nchaperons on the overall growth rate.\n",

In pulmonary artery\nsmooth muscle cells (PASMCs) nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate\n(NAADP) may trigger increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a\nmanner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent\nCa2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the\nSR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been\nestimated to be <400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy.\nThis study utilizes transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough\nultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. These\njunctions are prominent features in these cells and we estimate that the\nmembrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. We\nalso develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these\nmeasurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data.\nSimulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients show that the\nmagnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By\ncorrelation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated L-SR junctional\nCa2+ transients, we estimate that \"trigger zones\" with a 60-100 junctions are\nrequired to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the\n130 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most\nimportantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50\nnm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to\nbreach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. L-SR junctions are therefore a\npre-requisite for efficient Ca2+ signal coupling and may contribute to cellular\nfunction in health and disease.\n",

Such asymmetry has\nbeen hypothesized to occur via diffusion barriers, constraining protein lateral\nexchange in cellular membranes. Diffusion barriers have been extensively\nstudied in the plasma membrane, but their identity and organization within the\nnucleus remain unknown. Here, we propose how sphingolipid domains, protein\nrings, and morphological changes of the nucleus may coordinate to restrict\nprotein exchange between nuclear lobes. Our spatial stochastic model is based\non several lines of experimental evidence and predicts that, while a\nsphingolipid domain and a protein ring could constitute the barrier during\nearly anaphase; a sphingolipid domain spanning the bridge between lobes during\nlate anaphase would be entirely sufficient. Additionally, we explore the\nstructural organization of plausible diffusion barriers. Our work shows how\nnuclear diffusion barriers in closed mitosis may be emergent properties of\nsimple nanoscale biophysical interactions.\n",

The Hopfield-like metabolic dynamics are stable and can be maintained\nas a long-term biochemical memory.

The first\npassage time is computed using an efficient exact simulation algorithm and an\nasymptotic approximation in the limit that cavitation is rare. In this limit,\nwe find that the mean first passage time is sub-exponential, $T \\propto\ne^{N_{0}}/N_{0}^2$.

It has been proposed\nthat viral assembly satisfies these constraints through allosteric regulation,\nincluding the interconversion of capsid proteins among conformations with\ndifferent propensities for assembly. In this article we use computational and\ntheoretical modeling to explore how such allostery affects the assembly of\nicosahedral shells.

It is known that motor proteins work in teams enabling\nunidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long\ndistances. Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by\nmutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause\nneurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor\ndomain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a\nrecent study of phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating\nlowered single motor stalling forces. In this article we report the effects of\nmutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple\nwild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall\nforces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are\noutnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It is shown that mutants gain\na competitive advantage and lead to an increase in expected run-length when\nload on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant's stalling force or a\nmultiple of its stalling force. A separate contribution of this article is the\ndevelopment of a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple\nmotors of multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between\nvarious relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the\ntransition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables exact\ncomputation of average velocity and run-length. It can also be used to\nintroduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation\nand to deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by\nmultiple motors. Our method is easily implementable and we provide a software\npackage for general use.\n",

In the former, the reactant and target\nreact with a fixed probability per unit time when within a specified\nseparation. In the latter, upon reaching a fixed separation, they\nprobabilistically react or the reactant reflects away from the target.\nExpansions of the solution to each model are constructed by projecting out the\ncontribution of the first eigenvalue and eigenfunction to the solution of the\ndiffusion equation, and then developing matched asymptotic expansions in\nLaplace-transform space. Our approach offers an equivalent, but alternative,\nmethod to the pseudo-potential approach we previously employed in [Isaacson and\nNewby 2013] for the simpler Smoluchowski pure absorption reaction mechanism.

The role of\nmetabolism, and particularly mitochondria, is increasingly being recognised as\nan important explanatory factor in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Most eukaryotic\ncells possess a population of mitochondria, in the sense that mitochondrial DNA\n(mtDNA) is held in multiple copies per cell, where the sequence of each\nmolecule can vary. Hence intra-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity is\npossible, which can induce inter-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity, and may\ndrive aspects of cellular noise. In this review, we discuss sources of\nmitochondrial heterogeneity (variations between mitochondria in the same cell,\nand mitochondrial variations between supposedly identical cells) from both\ngenetic and non-genetic perspectives, and mitochondrial genotype-phenotype\nlinks. We discuss the apparent homeostasis of mtDNA copy number, the\nobservation of pervasive intra-cellular mtDNA mutation (we term\n`microheteroplasmy') and developments in the understanding of inter-cellular\nmtDNA mutation (`macroheteroplasmy'). We point to the relationship between\nmitochondrial supercomplexes, cristal structure, pH and cardiolipin as a\npotential amplifier of the mitochondrial genotype-phenotype link. We also\ndiscuss mitochondrial membrane potential and networks as sources of\nmitochondrial heterogeneity, and their influence upon the mitochondrial genome.\nFinally, we revisit the idea of mitochondrial complementation as a means of\ndampening mitochondrial genotype-phenotype links in light of recent\nexperimental developments. The diverse sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity,\nas well as their increasingly recognised role in contributing to cellular\nheterogeneity, highlights the need for future single-cell mitochondrial\nmeasurements in the context of cellular noise studies.\n",

Centrioles, the structural cores of\ncentrosomes and cilia, must duplicate every cell cycle to ensure their faithful\ninheritance through cellular divisions. Work in model organisms identified\nconserved proteins required for centriole duplication and found that altering\ntheir abundance affects centriole number. However, the biophysical principles\nthat ensure that, under physiological conditions, only a single procentriole is\nproduced on each mother centriole remain enigmatic. Here we propose a\nmechanistic biophysical model for the initiation of procentriole formation in\nmammalian cells. The model faithfully recapitulates the experimentally observed\ntransition from PLK4 uniformly distributed around the mother centriole, the\n\"ring\", to a unique PLK4 focus, the \"spot\", that triggers the assembly of a new\nprocentriole. This symmetry breaking requires a dual positive feedback based on\nautocatalytic activation of PLK4 and enhanced centriolar anchoring of PLK4-STIL\ncomplexes by phosphorylated STIL. We find that, contrary to previous proposals,\nin situ degradation of active PLK4 is insufficient to break symmetry. Instead,\nthe model predicts that competition between transient PLK4 activity maxima for\nPLK4-STIL complexes explains both the instability of the PLK4 ring and\nformation of the unique PLK4 spot. In the model, strong competition at\nphysiologically normal parameters robustly produces a single procentriole,\nwhile increasing overexpression of PLK4 and STIL weakens the competition and\ncauses progressive addition of procentrioles in agreement with experimental\nobservations.\n",

In some cases, the host can respond\nby producing an inhibitor of that enzyme, which can be considered as a\ncounter-counter defence. An example is provided by cephalosporins,\nbeta-lactamases and clavulanic acid (an inhibitor of beta-lactamases). Here, we\ntackle the question under which conditions it pays, during evolution, to\nestablish a counter-counter defence rather than to intensify or widen the\ndefence mechanisms. We establish a mathematical model describing this\nphenomenon, based on enzyme kinetics for competitive inhibition. We use an\nobjective function based on Haber's rule, which says that the toxic effect is\nproportional to the time integral of toxin concentration. The optimal\nallocation of defence and counter-counter defence can be calculated in an\nanalytical way despite the nonlinearity in the underlying differential\nequation. The calculation provides a threshold value for the dissociation\nconstant of the inhibitor. Only if the inhibition constant is below that\nthreshold, that is, in the case of strong binding of the inhibitor, it pays to\nhave a counter-counter defence. This theoretical prediction accounts for the\nobservation that not for all defence mechanisms, a counter-counter defence\nexists. Our results should be of interest for computing optimal mixtures of\nbeta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam, as\nwell as for plant-herbivore and other molecular-ecological interactions and to\nfight antibiotic resistance in general.\n",

While decades of experimental work have uncovered four fundamental\nprocesses that regulate organelle biogenesis, namely, de novo synthesis,\nfission, fusion and decay, a comprehensive understanding of how these processes\ntogether control organelle abundance remains elusive. Recent fluorescence\nmicroscopy experiments allow for the counting of organelles at the single-cell\nlevel. These measurements provide information about the cell-to-cell\nvariability in organelle abundance in addition to the mean level. Motivated by\nsuch measurements, we build upon a recent study and analyze a general\nstochastic model of organelle biogenesis. We compute the exact analytical\nexpressions for the probability distribution of organelle numbers, their mean,\nand variance across a population of single cells. It is shown that different\nmechanisms of organelle biogenesis lead to distinct signatures in the\ndistribution of organelle numbers which allows us to discriminate between these\nvarious mechanisms. By comparing our theory against published data for\nperoxisome abundance measurements in yeast, we show that a widely believed\nmodel of peroxisome biogenesis that involves de novo synthesis, fission, and\ndecay is inadequate in explaining the data. Also, our theory predicts\nbimodality in certain limits of the model.

To model these experimental findings, we\nhypothesize that vimentin may exist in two states, mobile and immobile, and\nswitches between the states at unknown (either constant or non-constant) rates.\nMobile vimentin are assumed to advect with either constant or non-constant\nvelocity. We introduce several biologically realistic scenarios using this set\nof assumptions. For each scenario, we use differential evolution to find the\nbest parameter sets resulting in a solution that most closely matches the\nexperimental data, then the assumptions are evaluated using the Akaike\nInformation Criterion. This modeling approach allows us to conclude that our\nexperimental data are best explained by a spatially dependent trapping of\nintermediate filaments or a spatially dependent speed of actin-dependent\ntransport.\n",

SignalP 5.0 is less sensitive than the previous versions of SignalP\nin this specific task, and also in the detection of signal peptides of\nnon-plastid proteins in diatoms. However, in combination with ASAFind, the\nresulting prediction performance for plastid proteins is high. In addition, we\ntested the multi-location prediction tool TargetP for its suitability to\nprovide signal peptide information to ASAFind.

A modification of this model also leads to an analytical distribution\nof the nascent RNA numbers. These solutions are routinely used for the analysis\nof single-cell data, including the inference of transcriptional parameters.\nHowever, these models neglect important mechanistic features of transcription\nelongation, such as the stochastic movement of RNA polymerases and their steric\ninteractions. Here we construct a model of gene expression describing promoter\nswitching between inactive and active states, binding of RNA polymerases in the\nactive state, their stochastic movement including steric interactions along the\ngene, and their unbinding leading to a mature transcript that subsequently\ndecays. We derive the steady-state distributions of the nascent and mature RNA\nnumbers in two important limiting cases: constitutive expression and slow\npromoter switching. We show that RNA fluctuations are suppressed by steric\ninteractions between RNA polymerases, and that this suppression can even lead\nto sub-Poissonian fluctuations; these effects are most pronounced for nascent\nRNA and less prominent for mature RNA, since the latter is not a direct sensor\nof transcription. We find a relationship between the parameters of our\nmicroscopic mechanistic model and those of the standard models that ensures\nexcellent consistency in their prediction of the first and second RNA number\nmoments over vast regions of parameter space, encompassing slow, intermediate,\nand rapid promoter switching, provided the RNA number distributions are\nPoissonian or super-Poissonian.

As ribosomes significantly contribute to both cellular\nmass and energy consumption, achieving efficient management of the ribosome\npopulation is also crucial to metabolism and growth. Inspired by biological\nevidence for nutrient-dependent mechanisms that control both ribosome active\ndegradation and genesis, we introduce a dynamical model of protein production,\nthat includes the dynamics of resources and control over the ribosome\npopulation. Under the hypothesis that active degradation and biogenesis are\noptimal for maximizing and maintaining protein production, we aim to\nqualitatively reproduce empirical observations of the ribosome population\ndynamics. Upon formulating the associated optimization problem, we first\nanalytically study the stability and global behaviour of solutions under\nconstant resource input, and characterize the extent of oscillations and\nconvergence rate to a global equilibrium. We further use these results to\nsimplify and solve the problem under a quasi-static approximation. Using\nbiophysical parameter values, we find that optimal control solutions lead to\nboth control mechanisms and the ribosome population switching between periods\nof feeding and fasting, suggesting that the intense regulation of ribosome\npopulation observed in experiments allows to maximize and maintain protein\nproduction.

These movements have been attributed to the action of\ncortical force generators which pull on the astral microtubules to position the\nspindle, as well as pushing events by these same microtubules against the cell\ncortex and plasma membrane. Attachment and detachment of cortical force\ngenerators working antagonistically against centring forces of microtubules\nhave been modelled previously (Grill et al. 2005, Phys. Rev.

In the limit of small restoring forces, we derive an algebraic\nprediction of the amplitude of spindle-pole oscillations and demonstrate the\nrelaxation structure of nonlinear oscillations. We also show how noise-induced\noscillations can arise in stochastic simulations for conditions in which the\nmean-field Fokker-Planck system predicts stability, but for which the period\ncan be estimated directly by the ODE model and the amplitude by a related\nstochastic differential equation that incorporates random binding kinetics.\n",

Computational simulations show the success of the system dynamic\nin easier and effective modeling of the cell signaling pathways, in addition to\nits diverse options for understanding and testing the pathway quantitatively\nand quantitatively at the same time in relation to other methods. More\nintestinally, the suggested approach here helps one to identify all biochemical\nreaction paths and loops for complex cell signaling pathways. It will be a good\nstep forward to define dominant systems for such complex cell signaling\npathways.\n",

The immune system, through its regulation of the inflammatory\nresponse, ensures cells and tissues can effectively activate defense mechanisms\nin response to infection and injury. However, there is still a lack of\neffective drugs that attenuate fungal virulence while relieving the\ninflammatory response caused by fungal keratitis. Therefore, finding effective\ntreatments to solve these problems is particularly important.\n  We synthesized ZIF-90 by water-based synthesis and characterized by SEM, XRD\netc. In vitro experiments included CCK-8 and ELISA. These evaluations verified\nthe disruptive effects of ZIF-90 on Aspergillus. fumigatus spore adhesion,\nmorphology, cell membrane, and the effect of ZIF-90 on apoptosis. In addition,\nto investigate whether the metal-ligand zinc and the organic ligand imidazole\nact as essential factors in ZIF-90, we investigated the in vitro antimicrobial\nand anti-inflammatory effects of ZIF-8, ZIF-67, and MOF-74 (Zn) by MIC and\nELISA experiments.\n  ZIF-90 has therapeutic effects on fungal keratitis, which could break the\nprotective organelles of Aspergillus. fumigatus, such as the cell wall. In\naddition, ZIF-90 can avoid excessive inflammatory response by promoting\napoptosis of inflammatory cells. The results demonstrated that both zinc ions\nand imidazole possessed antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. In\naddition, ZIF-90 exhibited better biocompatibility compared to ZIF-8, ZIF-67,\nand MOF-74 (Zn).\n  ZIF-90 has anti-inflammatory and antifungal effects and preferable\nbiocompatibility, and has great potential for the treatment of fungal\nkeratitis.\n",

This hydrophobic gating mechanism is thought to operate in a\nnumber of ion channels, e.g. the nicotinic receptor, bacterial mechanosensitive\nchannels (MscL and MscS) and perhaps in some potassium channels (e.g. KcsA,\nMthK, and KvAP). Simplified pore models allow one to investigate the primary\ncharacteristics of a conduction pathway, namely its geometry (shape, pore\nlength, and radius), the chemical character of the pore wall surface, and its\nlocal flexibility and surface roughness. Our extended (ca. 0.1 \\mu s) molecular\ndynamic simulations show that a short hydrophobic pore is closed to water for\nradii smaller than 0.45 nm. By increasing the polarity of the pore wall (and\nthus reducing its hydrophobicity) the transition radius can be decreased until\nfor hydrophilic pores liquid water is stable down to a radius comparable to a\nwater molecule's radius. Ions behave similarly but the transition from\nconducting to non-conducting pores is even steeper and occurs at a radius of\n0.65 nm for hydrophobic pores. The presence of water vapour in a constriction\nzone indicates a barrier for ion permeation. A thermodynamic model can explain\nthe behaviour of water in nanopores in terms of the surface tensions, which\nleads to a simple measure of \"hydrophobicity\" in this context. Furthermore,\nincreased local flexibility decreases the permeability of polar species. An\nincrease in temperature has the same effect, and we hypothesise that both\neffects can be explained by a decrease in the effective solvent-surface\nattraction which in turn leads to an increase in the solvent-wall surface free\nenergy.\n",

The second mechanism involves spatial\ngradients of a short-lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion\nbut then primarily via active transport along spindle microtubules. We propose\nthat both mechanisms may be operative in the metazoan spindle assembly\ncheckpoint, with either able to trigger anaphase onset even without support\nfrom the other pathway.\n",

Measuring the local concentration of such a\nprotein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of\nposition within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,\nposition determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental\nlimits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients\ndue to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on\ngradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have\nbeen experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology\nsettings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great\nprecision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.\nAs a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely\ndirected gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional\nprecision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging\ntime, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for\nhigh precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the\nexistence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is\nmaximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the\nconcentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints\non the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various\ncontexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single\ncell.\n",

Unlike regular enveloped\nviruses, retrovirus budding happens {\\em concurrently} with the self-assembly\nof retrovirus protein subunits (Gags) into spherical virus capsids on the cell\nmembrane. Led by this unique budding and assembly mechanism, we study the free\nenergy profile of retrovirus budding, taking into account of the Gag-Gag\nattraction energy and the membrane elastic energy. We find that if the Gag-Gag\nattraction is strong, budding always proceeds to completion. During early stage\nof budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\\alpha$, increases\nwith time as $\\alpha \\propto t^{1/3}$. However, when Gag-Gag attraction is\nweak, a metastable state of partial budding appears. The zenith angle of these\npartially spherical capsids is given by\n$\\alpha_0\\simeq(\\tau^2/\\kappa\\sigma)^{1/4}$ in a linear approximation, where\n$\\kappa$ and $\\sigma$ are the bending modulus and the surface tension of the\nmembrane, and $\\tau$ is a line tension of the capsid proportional to the\nstrength of Gag-Gag attraction.

Using experimental parameters, we show that HIV budding and\nassembly always proceed to completion in normal biological conditions. On the\nother hand, by changing Gag-Gag interaction strength or membrane rigidity, it\nis relatively easy to tune it back and forth between complete budding and\npartial budding.

Our results\nsuggest the suppression of these pauses by the ribosomal antitermination\ncomplex to be essential at fast growth. Moreover, unsuppressed pausing by even\na few non-antiterminated RNAPs can already reduce transcription drastically\nunder dense traffic.

The precise mechanism of this\nforeign-self-distinction, though one of the major tasks of the immune system,\ncontinues to be a fundamental puzzle. Recent progress has been made by van den\nBerg, Rand, and Burroughs (2001), who modelled the \\emph{probabilistic} nature\nof the interaction between the relevant cell types, namely, T-cells and\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, the stochasticity is due to the random\nsample of antigens present on the surface of every APC, and to the random\nreceptor type that characterises individual T-cells. It has been shown\npreviously that this model, though highly idealised, is capable of reproducing\nimportant aspects of the recognition phenomenon, and of explaining them on the\nbasis of stochastic rare events. These results were obtained with the help of a\nrefined large deviation theorem and were thus asymptotic in nature. Simulations\nhave, so far, been restricted to the straightforward simple sampling approach,\nwhich does not allow for sample sizes large enough to address more detailed\nquestions. Building on the available large deviation results, we develop an\nimportance sampling technique that allows for a convenient exploration of the\nrelevant tail events by means of simulation. With its help, we investigate the\nmechanism of statistical recognition in some depth. In particular, we\nillustrate how a foreign antigen can stand out against the self background if\nit is present in sufficiently many copies, although no \\emph{a priori}\ndifference between self and nonself is built into the model.\n",

In a \"power-stroke\" model the observed independence\nof the speed at low load on the number of stators is explained by a\ntorque-dependent stepping mechanism independent of the strength of the stator\ntethering spring. On the other hand, in models that depend solely on the stator\nspring to explain the observed behavior, exceedingly small stator spring\nconstants are required. To study the dynamics of the motor driven by external\nforces (such as those exerted by an optical tweezer), back-stepping is\nintroduced when stators are driven far out of equilibrium. Our model with\nback-stepping reproduces the observed absence of a barrier to backward\nrotation, as well the behaviors in the high-speed negative-torque regime.\nRecently measured temperature dependence of the motor speed near zero load\n(Yuan & Berg 2010 Biophys J) is explained quantitatively by the thermally\nactivated stepping rates in our model. Finally, we suggest that the general\nmechanical properties of all molecular motors (linear and rotary),\ncharacterized by their force(torque)-speed curve, can be determined by their\npower-stroke potentials and the dependence of the stepping rates on the\nmechanical state of the motor (force or speed). The torque-speed curve for the\nclockwise rotating flagellar motor has been observed for the first time\nrecently (Yuan et al. 2010 PNAS). Its quasi-linear behavior is quantitatively\nreproduced by our model. In particular, we show that concave and convex shapes\nof the torque-speed curve can be achieved by changing the interaction potential\nfrom linear to quadratic form. We also show that reversing the stepping rate\ndependence on force (torque) can lead to non-monotonicity in the speed-load\ndependency.\n",

The particle is a smooth sphere which experiences attractive\ninteractions to the lipid head groups. Depending on the parameters, we observe\nfour classes of dynamical trajectories: particle adhesion to the membrane,\nstalled partially wrapped states, budding followed by scission, and membrane\nrupture. In most regions of parameter space we find that the elastic theory\nagrees nearly quantitatively with the simulated phase behavior as a function of\nadhesion strength, membrane bending rigidity, and particle radius. However, at\nparameter values near the transition between particle adhesion and budding, we\nobserve long-lived partially wrapped states which are not captured by existing\nelastic theories. These states could constrain the accessible system parameters\nfor those enveloped viruses or drug delivery vehicles which rely on exo- or\nendocytosis for membrane transport.\n",

        "summary": "  Bidirectional cargo transport by molecular motors in cells is a complex\nphenomenon, in which the cargo (usually a vesicle) alternately moves in\nretrograde and anterograde directions. In this case, teams of oppositely\npulling motors (eg., kinesin and dynein) bind to the cargo simultaneously, and\n`coordinate' their activity such that the motion consists of spells of\npositively and negatively directed segments, separated by pauses of varying\nduration. A set of recent experiments have analyzed the bidirectional motion of\nendosomes in the amoeba D. discoideum in detail. It was found that in between\ndirectional switches, a team of 5-6 dyneins stall a cargo against a stronger\nkinesin in tug of war, which lasts for almost a second. As the mean detachment\ntime of a kinesin under its stall load was also observed to be ~ 1s, we infer\nthat the collective detachment time of the dynein assembly must also be\nsimilar. Here, we analyze this inference from a modeling perspective, using\nexperimentally measured single-molecule parameters as inputs. We find that the\ncommonly assumed exponential load-dependent detachment rate is inconsistent\nwith observations, as it predicts that a 5-dynein assembly will detach under\nits combined stall load in less than a hundredth of a second. A modified model\nwhere the load-dependent unbinding rate is assumed to saturate at stall-force\nlevel for super-stall loads gives results which are in agreement with\nexperimental data. Our analysis suggests that the load-dependent detachment of\na dynein in a team is qualitatively different at sub-stall and super-stall\nloads, a conclusion which is likely to have implications in other situations\ninvolving collective effects of many motors.\n",

Stuttering was affected by the rate of immediate rebinding of MinE\nreleased from depolymerizing filament tips (processivity), protection of\ndepolymerizing filament tips from MinD binding, and fragmentation of MinD\nfilaments due to MinE. Each of processivity, protection, and fragmentation\nreduces stuttering, speeds oscillations, and reduces MinD filament lengths.\nNeither processivity or tip-protection were, on their own, sufficient to\nproduce fast stutter-free oscillations. While filament fragmentation could, on\nits own, lead to fast oscillations with infrequent stuttering; high levels of\nfragmentation degraded oscillations. The infrequent stuttering observed in\nstandard Min oscillations are consistent with short filaments of MinD, while we\nexpect that mutants that exhibit higher stuttering frequencies will exhibit\nlonger MinD filaments.

In many cases, cargo\nmotion powered by motor proteins is found to be bidirectional, and may be\nviewed as a biased random walk with fast unidirectional runs interspersed with\nslow `tug-of-war' states. The statistical properties of this walk are not known\nin detail, and here, we study memory and bias, as well as directional\ncorrelations between successive runs in bidirectional transport. We show, based\non a study of the direction reversal probabilities of the cargo using a purely\nstochastic (tug-of-war) model, that bidirectional motion of cellular cargoes\nis, in general, a correlated random walk. In particular, while the motion of a\ncargo driven by two oppositely pulling motors is a Markovian random walk,\nmemory of direction appears when multiple motors haul the cargo in one or both\ndirections. In the latter case, the Markovian nature of the underlying single\nmotor processes is hidden by internal transitions between degenerate run and\npause states of the cargo. Interestingly, memory is found to be a non-monotonic\nfunction of the number of motors. Stochastic numerical simulations of the\ntug-of-war model support our mathematical results and extend them to\nbiologically relevant situations.\n",

We study a\ndiscrete version of a stochastic model of the GTP cap dynamics, originally\nproposed by Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler (Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler, Phys.\nRev. Lett. 73, 2372, 1994). Our model includes both spontaneous and vectorial\nhydrolysis, as well as dissociation of a non-hydrolyzed dimer from the filament\nafter incorporation. In the first part of the paper, we apply this model to a\nsingle protofilament of a microtubule. A catastrophe transition is defined for\neach protofilament, similar to the earlier one-dimensional models, the\nfrequency of occurrence of which is then calculated under various conditions,\nbut without explicit assumption of steady state conditions. Using a\nperturbative approach, we show that the leading asymptotic behavior of the\nprotofilament catastrophe in the limit of large growth velocities is remarkably\nsimilar across different models. In the second part of the paper, we extend our\nanalysis to the entire filament by making a conjecture that a minimum number of\nsuch transitions are required to occur for the onset of microtubule\ncatastrophe. The frequency of microtubule catastrophe is then determined using\nnumerical simulations, and compared with analytical/semi-analytical estimates\nmade under steady state/quasi-steady state assumptions respectively for the\nprotofilament dynamics. A few relevant experimental results are analyzed in\ndetail, and compared with predictions from the model.

In cells, the MT growth rate is inhibited by cytosolic stathmin,\nwhich, in turn, is inactivated by Rac1. Growing MTs activate Rac1 at the cell\nedge, which closes a positive feedback loop. We investigate both tubulin\nsequestering and catastrophe promotion as mechanisms for MT growth inhibition\nby stathmin. For a homogeneous stathmin concentration in the absence of Rac1,\nwe find a switch-like regulation of the MT mean length by stathmin. For\nconstitutively active Rac1 at the cell edge, stathmin is deactivated locally,\nwhich establishes a spatial gradient of active stathmin. In this gradient, we\nfind a stationary bimodal MT length distributions for both mechanisms of MT\ngrowth inhibition by stathmin. One subpopulation of the bimodal length\ndistribution can be identified with fast growing and long pioneering MTs in the\nregion near the cell edge, which have been observed experimentally. The\nfeedback loop is closed through Rac1 activation by MTs. For tubulin\nsequestering by stathmin, this establishes a bistable switch with two stable\nstates: one stable state corresponds to upregulated MT mean length and bimodal\nMT length distributions, i.e., pioneering MTs; the other stable state\ncorresponds to an interrupted feedback with short MTs. Stochastic effects as\nwell as external perturbations can trigger switching events. For catastrophe\npromoting stathmin we do not find bistability.\n",

The Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar\nto the APIs of Matlab and SciPy, making it fast and easy to learn, even for new\nusers. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the\nwidely-used LLVM JIT compiler framework to compile SBML-specified models\ndirectly into very fast native machine code for a variety of processors, making\nit appropriate for solving very large models or multiple replicas of smaller\nmodels. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML\nspecification (except for delay and nonlinear algebraic equations) and several\nof its extensions. It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators,\nas well as tools for steady-state, stability analyses and flux balance\nanalysis.

Very high siRNA loading capacities of up to 380 microg/mg\nMSN were obtained with charge-matched amino-functionalized mesoporous cores,\nand release profiles show up to 80% siRNA elution after 24 h.

The\nnegatively charged MSN shell enabled the association with a block copolymer\ncontaining positively charged artificial amino acids and oleic acid blocks,\nwhich acts simultaneously as capping function and endosomal release agent. The\npotential of this multifunctional delivery platform is demonstrated by highly\neffective cell transfection and siRNA delivery into KB-cells.

Ketamine is\nmetabolized to its active metabolite norketamine principally by liver CYP3A.\nDrug metabolism alterations during aging have severe consequences particularly\nin anesthesiology and very few studies on older animals were conducted for\nketamine. The objective of the present study is to assess the influence of\naging on CYP3A metabolism of ketamine. Liver S9 fractions from 3, 6, 12 and 18\nmonth old male Sprague Dawley rats were prepared and Michaelis-Menten\nparameters were determined for primary metabolic pathways. The derived maximum\nenzyme velocity (i.e. Vmax) suggests a rapid saturation of the CYP3A enzyme\nactive sites in liver S9 fractions of 18-month old rats. Observed Vmax for\nLiver S9 fractions from 3, 6 and 12 month old male Sprague Dawley rats were\n2.39 (+-0.23), 2.61 (+-0.18), and 2.07 (+-0.07) respectively compared to 0.68\n(+-0.02) for Liver S9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats.\nInterestingly, we observed a 6 to 7 fold change in the derived Km when\ncomparing Liver S9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats with\nLiver S9 fractions from younger rats. Our results suggest that rat CYP3A enzyme\nundergoes conformational changes with age particularly in our geriatric group\n(e.g. 18 month rats) leading significant decrease in the rate of formation of\nnorketamine. Moreover, our results strongly suggest a severe impairment of\nCYP3A ketamine mediated metabolism.\n",

The\nbinding GTP or ATP is hydrolyzed to GDP (guanidine diphosphate) or ADP\n(adenosine diphosphate) by the monomeric enzymatic activity.

To quantitatively evaluate the\nassembly kinetics, we propose a nonlinear and non-equilibrium kinetic model,\nwith the nonlinearity provided by the fluctuation in monomer concentrations\nduring the diffusion. Numerical simulations suggest that the assembly and\ndisassembly oscillates in a chaos-like manner. We use a kinetic analysis of the\ncenter manifold around the critical point to show that minimal increases in\nATP/GTP concentrations may lead to some attenuation in the amplification of\nthese fluctuations.

Here we show that the\nsmall-volume effect enables robust, sensitive and efficient information\ntransfer in the spine volume, but not in the cell volume. In the spine volume,\nintrinsic noise in reactions becomes larger than extrinsic noise of input,\nmaking robust information transfer against input fluctuation. Stochastic\nfacilitation of Ca$^{2+}$ increase occurs in the spine volume, making higher\nsensitivity to lower intensity of input. Volume-dependency of information\ntransfer enables efficient information transfer per input in the spine volume.\nThus, we propose that the small-volume effect is the functional reasons why the\nspine has to be so small.\n",

To\nanalyse the effects of spatial heterogeneity of the signalling processes, along\nwith spatially-homogeneous ODE models we derive coupled PDE-ODE systems\nmodelling the temporal and spatial dynamics of molecules involved in the\nsignalling pathways. The values of the parameters in the model for the BR\nsignalling pathway are determined using experimental data on the gene\nexpression of BR biosynthetic enzymes. The stability of steady state solutions\nof our mathematical model, shown for a wide range of parameters, can be related\nto the BR homeostasis. Our results for the crosstalk model suggest that the\ninteraction between transcription factors BZR and DELLA exerts more influence\non the dynamics of the signalling pathways than BZR-mediated biosynthesis of\nGA, suggesting that the interaction between transcription factors may\nconstitute the principal mechanism of the crosstalk between the BR and GA\nsignalling pathways. In general, perturbations in the GA signalling pathway\nhave larger effects on the dynamics of components of the BR signalling pathway\nthan perturbations in the BR signalling pathway on the dynamics of the GA\npathway. The perturbation in the crosstalk mechanism also has a larger effect\non the dynamics of the BR pathway than of the GA pathway.

This apparent paradox is due to shortening and elongation of the\ntelomere, which suggests a random walk model of the telomere's length. The\nmodel indicates two phases, first, a determinist drift of the length toward a\nquasi-equilibrium state, and second, persistence of the length near an\nattracting state for the majority of divisions prior to senescence. The measure\nof stability of the latter phase is the expected number of divisions at the\nattractor (\"lifetime\") prior to crossing a threshold to senescence. The\ntelomerase regulates stability by creating an effective potential barrier that\nseparates statistically the shortest lifetime from the next shortest. The\nrandom walk has to overcome the barrier in order to extend the range of the\nfirst regime. The model explains how random telomere dynamics underlies the\nextension of cell survival time.\n",

With these\nmathematical tools, we obtain explicit formulas for experimentally measurable\nquantities, such as cargo velocity and run length. Analyzing these formulas\nthen yields some predictions regarding so-called non-processive clustering, the\nphenomenon that a single motor cannot transport cargo, but that two or more\nmotors can. We find that having motor stepping, binding, and unbinding rates\ndepend on the number of bound motors, due to geometric effects, is necessary\nand sufficient to explain recent experimental data on non-processive motors.\n",

        "summary": "  Understanding how transcription factors (TFs) regulate mammalian gene\nexpression in space and time is a central topic in biology. To activate a gene,\na TF has first to diffuse in the available space of the nucleus until it\nreaches a target DNA sequence or protein (target site). This eventually results\nin the recruitment of the whole transcriptional machinery.\n  All these processes take place in the mammalian nucleoplasm, a highly\norganized and dynamic environment, in which some complexes transiently assemble\nand break apart, whereas others appear more stable. This diversity of dynamic\nbehaviors arises from the number of biomolecules that make up the nucleoplasm\nand their pairwise interactions. Indeed, interactions energies that span\nseveral orders of magnitude, from covalent bounds to transient and dynamic\ninteractions can shape nuclear landscapes. Thus, the nuclear environment\ndetermines how frequently and how fast a TF contacts its target site, and\nindirectly gene expression. How exactly transient interactions are involved in\nthe regulation of TF diffusion is unclear, but are reflected by live cell\nimaging techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence\nrecovery after photobleaching or single-particle tracking. Overall, the\nmacroscopic result of these microscopic interactions is almost always anomalous\ndiffusion, a phenomenon widely studied and modeled.\n  Here, we review the connections between the anomalous diffusion of a TF and\nthe microscopic organization of the nucleus, including recently described\ntopologically associated domains and dynamic phase-separated compartments. We\npropose that anomalous diffusion found in single particle tracking (SPT) data\nresult from weak and transient interactions with dynamic nuclear substructures,\nand that SPT data analysis would benefit form a better description of such\nstructures.\n",

The two states are the 'locked' ground\nstate where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an\nasymmetric torsional potential, and a 'free' excited state in which FliJ\nundergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat\ntransitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity\nof the FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: ~9.0 rps.

Two\nmodes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which\nthe motor performs useful work either by continuously 'grinding' through the\nresistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it.

We demonstrate the\norigin and diversification of the metabolic cycle by the computer simulation of\nour model. Such a simulation is expected to be the simplified demonstration of\nwhat actually occurred in the primordial soup. Our model describes an analog\nera preceding the digital era based on the genetic code.\n",

New statistics based formulas\nfor the Hill coefficient and the effective Hill coefficient are provided and\nnecessary conditions for a system to be ultrasensitive are exhibited. We then\nassume that the binding process is described by a density dependent birth and\ndeath process. We provide precise large deviation results for the steady state\ndistribution of the process, and show that switch-like ultrasensitive responses\nare strongly related to the multi-stability of the associated dynamical system.\nUltrasensitivity occurs if and only if the entropy of the dynamical system has\nmore than one global minimum for some critical ligand concentration. In this\ncase, the Hill coefficient is proportional to the number of binding sites, and\nthe systems is highly ultrasensitive. We also discuss the interpretation of an\nextension $I_q$ of the effective Hill coefficient $I_{0.9}$ for which we\nrecommend the computation of a broad range of values of $q$ instead of just the\nstandard one corresponding to the 10% to 90% variation in the dose-response. It\nis shown that this single choice can sometimes mislead the conclusion by not\ndetecting ultrasensitivity. This new approach allows a better understanding of\nmultisite ultrasensitive systems and provides new tools for the design of such\nsystems.\n",

However, in some gliding assays, where microtubules move over a carpet\nof molecular motors, individual microtubules can also form tight arcs or rings,\neven in the absence of crosslinking proteins. Understanding this phenomenon may\nprovide important explanations for similar highly curved microtubules which can\nbe found in nerve cells undergoing neurodegeneration. We propose a model for\ngliding assays where the kinesins moving the microtubules over the surface\ninduce ring formation through differential binding, substantiated by recent\nfindings that a mutant version of the motor protein kinesin applied in solution\nis able to lock-in microtubule curvature. For certain parameter regimes, our\nmodel predicts that both straight and curved microtubules can exist\nsimultaneously as stable steady-states, as has been seen experimentally.\nAdditionally, unsteady solutions are found, where a wave of differential\nbinding propagates down the microtubule as it glides across the surface, which\ncan lead to chaotic motion. Whilst this model explains two-dimensional\nmicrotubule behaviour in an experimental gliding assay, it has the potential to\nbe adapted to explain pathological curling in nerve cells.\n",

Starting from the well-defined geometry of final autophagosomes we\nask the question of how these organelles can be formed by combining various\npreautophagosomal membranes such as vesicles, membrane tubules or sheets. We\nanalyse the geometric constraints of autophagosome formation by taking the area\nof the precursor membranes and their internal volume into account.

However,\nunder abnormal conditions Ca leaks from the SR, decreasing heart contraction\namplitude and increasing risk of life-threatening arrhythmia. The mechanisms\nand regimes of SR operation generating the abnormal Ca leak remain unclear.\nHere we employed both numerical and analytical modeling to get mechanistic\ninsights into the emergent Ca leak phenomenon. Our numerical simulations using\na detailed realistic model of Ca release unit (CRU) reveal sharp transitions\nresulting in Ca leak. The emergence of leak is closely mapped mathematically to\nthe Ising model from statistical mechanics. The system steady-state behavior is\ndetermined by two aggregate parameters: the analogues of magnetic field ($h$)\nand the inverse temperature ($\\beta$) in the Ising model, for which we have\nexplicit formulas in terms of SR Ca and release channel opening/closing rates.\nThe classification of leak regimes takes the shape of a phase $\\beta$-$h$\ndiagram, with the regime boundaries occurring at $h$=0 and a critical value of\n$\\beta$ ($\\beta*$) which we estimate using a classical Ising model and mean\nfield theory. Our theory predicts that a synchronized Ca leak will occur when\n$h$>0 and $\\beta>\\beta*$ and a disordered leak occurs when $\\beta<\\beta*$ and\n$h$ is not too negative. The disorder leak is distinguished from synchronized\nleak (in long-lasting sparks) by larger Peierls contour lengths, an output\nparameter reflecting degree of disorder. Thus, in addition to our detailed\nnumerical model approach we also offer an instantaneous computational tool\nusing analytical formulas of the Ising model for respective RyR parameters and\nSR Ca load that describe and classify phase transitions and leak emergence.\n",

These motors rely on energy derived from ATP,\nsupplied, in part, by diffusion from the sarcoplasm to the interior of the\nlattice of actin and myosin filaments. The radial spacing of filaments in this\nlattice may change or remain constant during contraction. If the lattice is\nisovolumetric, it must expand when the muscle shortens. If, however, the\nspacing is constant or has a different pattern of axial and radial motion, then\nthe lattice changes volume during contraction, driving fluid motion and\nassisting in the transport of molecules between the contractile lattice and the\nsurrounding intracellular space. We first create an\nadvective-diffusive-reaction flow model and show that the flow into and out of\nthe sarcomere lattice would be significant in the absence of lattice expansion.\nAdvective transport coupled to diffusion has the potential to substantially\nenhance metabolite exchange within the crowded sarcomere. Using time-resolved\nx-ray diffraction of contracting muscle, we next show that the contractile\nlattice is neither isovolumetric nor constant in spacing. Instead, lattice\nspacing is time-varying, depends on activation, and can manifest as an\neffective time-varying Poisson ratio. The resulting fluid flow in the sarcomere\nlattice of synchronous insect flight muscles is greater than expected for\nconstant lattice spacing conditions. Lattice spacing depends on a variety of\nfactors that produce radial force, including crossbridges, titin-like\nmolecules, and other structural proteins. Volume change and advective transport\nvaries with the phase of muscle stimulation but remains significant at all\nconditions.

Lateral diffusion of protein aggregates or\nclusters on the surface of the PM plays an important role in governing their\nheterogeneous surface distribution. However, the stability behavior of the\nsurface distribution of protein aggregates remains poorly understood.\nTherefore, understanding the spatial patterns that can emerge on the PM solely\nthrough protein-protein interaction, lateral diffusion, and feedback is an\nimportant step towards a complete description of the mechanisms behind protein\nclustering on the cell surface. In this work, we investigate the pattern\nformation of a reaction-diffusion model that describes the dynamics of a system\nof ligand-receptor complexes. The purely diffusive ligand in the cytosol can\nbind receptors in the PM, and the resultant ligand-receptor complexes not only\ndiffuse laterally but can also form clusters resulting in different oligomers.\nFinally, the largest oligomers recruit ligands from the cytosol in a positive\nfeedback. From a methodological viewpoint, we provide theoretical estimates for\ndiffusion-driven instabilities of the protein aggregates based on the Turing\nmechanism. Our main result is a threshold phenomenon, in which a sufficiently\nhigh recruitment of ligands promotes the input of new monomeric components and\nconsequently drives the formation of a single-patch spatially heterogeneous\nsteady-state.\n",

Moreover, the rates\nincrease if the DNA is coiled rather than straight. Here we model how this\nworks $in~vivo$ in mammalian cells.

We then put forward a master\nequation for the density of searching protein that allows us to calculate the\nassociation rates across the genome analytically. For segments where the rates\nare high, we find that they are enriched with active genes and have high RNA\nexpression levels.

This is true for vesicles in intracellular\ntransport, micro-organisms like bacteria, or animals moving within and\nresponding to their environment. For example, in cells the movement of\nvesicles, organelles and other cargo are affected by their binding to and\nunbinding from cytoskeletal filaments such as microtubules through molecular\nmotor proteins. A typical goal of theoretical or numerical analysis of models\nof such systems is to investigate the effective transport properties and their\ndependence on model parameters. While the effective velocity of particles\nundergoing switching diffusion is often easily characterized in terms of the\nlong-time fraction of time that particles spend in each state, the calculation\nof the effective diffusivity is more complicated because it cannot be expressed\nsimply in terms of a statistical average of the particle transport state at one\nmoment of time. However, it is common that these systems are regenerative, in\nthe sense that they can be decomposed into independent cycles marked by returns\nto a base state. Using decompositions of this kind, we calculate effective\ntransport properties by computing the moments of the dynamics within each cycle\nand then applying renewal-reward theory. This method provides a useful\nalternative large-time analysis to direct homogenization for linear\nadvection-reaction-diffusion partial differential equation models. Moreover, it\napplies to a general class of semi-Markov processes and certain stochastic\ndifferential equations that arise in models of intracellular transport.\nApplications of the proposed framework are illustrated for case studies such as\nmRNA transport in developing oocytes and processive cargo movement by teams of\nmotor proteins.\n",

Molecular motors of the\nkinesin-8 protein family depolymerise microtubules in a length-dependent\nmanner, and experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a role for kinesin-8\nin the dynamic regulation of microtubules. However, so far the detailed\nmolecular mechanisms how these molecular motors interact with the growing\nmicrotubule tip remain elusive. Here we investigate two interaction scenarios\nfor kinesin-8 and the microtubule tip. We give a comprehensive analysis of\nregimes where length-regulation is possible and characterise how the stationary\nlength depends on the biochemical rates and the bulk concentrations of the\nvarious proteins. For a neutral scenario, where microtubules grow irrespective\nof whether the microtubule tip is occupied by a molecular motor, length\nregulation is possible only for a narrow range of biochemical rates and limited\nto small polymerisation rates. In contrast, for an inhibition scenario, where\nthe presence of a motor at the microtubule tip inhibits microtubule growth, the\nregime of length regulation is extremely broad and includes high growth rates.\nThese results also apply to situations where polymerising enzymes, like\nXMAP215, and kinesin-8 mutually exclude each other from the microtubule tip. We\nalso investigate the stochastic dynamics of the two scenarios. While for the\nneutral scenario length is tightly controlled, length dynamics is intermittent\nfor the inhibition scenario and exhibits extended periods of microtubule growth\nand shrinkage, reminiscent of microtubule dynamic instability. On a broader\nperspective, the set of models established in this work quite generally\nsuggests that mutual exclusion of molecules at the ends of cytoskeletal\nfilaments is an important factor for filament dynamics and regulation.\n",

We consider four different\nstochastic copy protocols of increasing complexity, inspired by building blocks\nof the mRNA translation pathway. In the first protocol, monomer incorporation\noccurs in a single stochastic transition. We then move to a more elaborate\nprotocol in which an intermediate step can be used for error correction.\nFinally, we discuss the operating regimes of two kinetic proofreading\nprotocols: one in which proofreading acts from the final copying step, and one\nin which it acts from an intermediate step. We review known results for these\nmodels and, in some cases, extend them to analyze all possible combinations of\nenergetic and kinetic discrimination. We show that, in each of these protocols,\nonly a limited number of these combinations leads to an improvement of the\noverall copying accuracy.\n",

        "summary": "  The fidelity of DNA replication by DNA polymerase (DNAP) has long been an\nimportant issue in biology. While numerous experiments have revealed details of\nthe molecular structure and working mechanism of DNAP which consists of both a\npolymerase site and an exonuclease (proofreading) site, there were quite few\ntheoretical studies on the fidelity issue. The first model which explicitly\nconsidered both sites was proposed in 1970s' and the basic idea was widely\naccepted by later models. However, all these models did not systematically and\nrigorously investigate the dominant factor on DNAP fidelity, i.e, the\nhigher-order terminal effects through which the polymerization pathway and the\nproofreading pathway coordinate to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we\npropose a new and comprehensive kinetic model of DNAP based on some recent\nexperimental observations, which includes previous models as special cases. We\npresent a rigorous and unified treatment of the corresponding steady-state\nkinetic equations of any-order terminal effects, and derive analytical\nexpressions for fidelity in terms of kinetic parameters under bio-relevant\nconditions. These expressions offer new insights on how the the higher-order\nterminal effects contribute substantially to the fidelity in an order-by-order\nway, and also show that the polymerization-and-proofreading mechanism is\ndominated only by very few key parameters. We then apply these results to\ncalculate the fidelity of some real DNAPs, which are in good agreements with\nprevious intuitive estimates given by experimentalists.\n",

The\ncrowding molecules can be of arbitrary shape and size and numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that those factors together with the size of the diffusing molecule\nplay a crucial role on the magnitude of the decrease in diffusive motion.

Polymerization dynamics\nof actin filaments, comprising the structural core of filopodia, largely\ndetermine their instantaneous lengths and overall lifetimes. The polymerization\nreactions at the filopodial tip require transport of G-actin, which enter the\nfilopodial tube from the filopodial base and diffuse toward the filament barbed\nends near the tip. Actin filaments are mechanically coupled into a tight bundle\nby cross-linker proteins. Interestingly, many of these proteins are relatively\nshort, restricting the free diffusion of cytosolic G-actin throughout the\nbundle and, in particular, its penetration into the bundle core. To investigate\nthe effect of steric restrictions on G-actin diffusion by the porous structure\nof filopodial actin filament bundle, we used a particle-based stochastic\nsimulation approach. We discovered that excluded volume interactions result in\npartial and then full collapse of central filaments in the bundle, leading to a\nhollowed-out structure. The latter may further collapse radially due to the\nactivity of cross-linking proteins, hence producing conical-shaped filament\nbundles. Interestingly, electron microscopy experiments on mature filopodia\nindeed frequently reveal actin bundles that are narrow at the tip and wider at\nthe base. Overall, our work demonstrates that excluded volume effects in the\ncontext of reaction-diffusion processes in porous networks may lead to\nunexpected geometric growth patterns and complicated, history-dependent\ndynamics of intermediate metastable configurations.\n",

This randomness of synaptic MC contributes to the\nrandomness of the electrochemical downstream signal in the postsynaptic cell,\ncalled postsynaptic membrane potential (PSP). Since the randomness of the PSP\nis relevant for neural computation and learning, characterizing the statistics\nof the PSP is critical. However, the statistical characterization of the\nsynaptic reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible\nbi-molecular reaction of NTs with receptors renders the system nonlinear.\nConsequently, there is currently no model available which characterizes the\nimpact of the statistics of postsynaptic receptor activation on the PSP. In\nthis work, we propose a novel statistical model for the synaptic\nreaction-diffusion process in terms of the chemical master equation (CME). We\nfurther propose a novel numerical method which allows to compute the CME\nefficiently and we use this method to characterize the statistics of the PSP.\nFinally, we present results from stochastic particle-based computer simulations\nwhich validate the proposed models. We show that the biophysical parameters\ngoverning synaptic transmission shape the autocovariance of the receptor\nactivation and, ultimately, the statistics of the PSP. Our results suggest that\nthe processing of the synaptic signal by the postsynaptic cell effectively\nmitigates synaptic noise while the statistical characteristics of the synaptic\nsignal are preserved.

The\nformation and maintenance of calcium homeostasis are closely related to the\nspatial distribution of calcium channels. In the current paper, a theoretical\nframework is established by abstracting the spatial distribution of the calcium\nchannels as a nonlinear biological complex network with calcium channels as\nnodes and Ca$^{2+}$ as edges. A dynamical model for a RyR is adopted to\ninvestigate the effect of spatial distribution on calcium oscillation. The\nmean-field model can be well reproduced from the complete graph and dense\nErd\\\"os-R\\'enyi network. The synchronization of RyRs is found important to\ngenerate a global calcium oscillation. The clique graph with a cluster\nstructure can not produce a global oscillation due to the failure of\nsynchronization between clusters. A more realistic geometric network is\nconstructed in a two-dimensional plane based on the experimental information\nabout the RyR arrangement of clusters and the frequency distribution of cluster\nsizes. Different from the clique graph, the global oscillation can be generated\nwith reasonable parameters on the geometric network. The simulation also\nsuggests that existence of small clusters and rogue RyR's plays an important\nrole in the maintenance of global calcium oscillation through keeping\nsynchronization between large clusters. Such results support the heterogeneous\ndistribution of RyR's with different-size clusters, which is helpful to\nunderstand recent observations with super resolution nanoscale imaging\ntechniques.

Anillin is found at major sites of\ncortical activity, such as adherens junctions and the cytokinetic furrow, where\nthe canonical regulator of actomyosin remodelling is the small GTPase, RhoA.\nRhoA acts via intermediary 'effectors' to increase both the rates of activation\nof myosin motors and the polymerisation of actin filaments. Anillin has been\nshown to scaffold this action of RhoA - improving critical rates in the\nsignalling pathway without altering the essential biochemistry - but its\ncontribution to the wider spatio-temporal organisation of the cortical\ncytoskeleton remains poorly understood. Here, we combine analytics and numerics\nto show how anillin can non-trivially regulate the cytoskeleton at hydrodynamic\nscales. At short times, anillin can amplify or dampen existing contractile\ninstabilities, as well as alter the parameter ranges over which they occur. At\nlong times, it can change both the size and speed of steady-state travelling\npulses. The primary mechanism that underpins these behaviours is established to\nbe the advection of anillin by myosin II motors, with the specifics relying on\nthe values of two coupling parameters. These codify anillin's effect on local\nsignalling kinetics and can be traced back to its interaction with the acidic\nphospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thereby establishing\na putative connection between actomyosin remodelling and membrane composition.\n",

The molecular details of the motor\nmechanism are still largely unknown, while other features have been identified,\nsuch as the ring-shaped protein structure of the PilT motor. The surprisingly\nhigh forces generated by the PilT system motivate a model investigation of the\ngeneration of large forces in molecular motors.

The model describes\nthe motor subunits in terms of diffusing particles in an asymmetric,\ntime-dependent binding potential (flashing ratchet potential), roughly\ncorresponding to the ATP hydrolysis cycle. We compute force-velocity relations\nin a subset of the parameter space and explore how the maximum force (stall\nforce) is determined by stiffness, binding strength, ensemble size, and degree\nof asymmetry. We identify two qualitatively different regimes of operation\ndepending on the relation between ensemble size and asymmetry. In the\ntransition between these two regimes, the stall force depends nonlinearly on\nthe number of motor subunits. Compared to its constituents without\ninteractions, we find higher efficiency and qualitatively different\nforce-velocity relations.

For this model we develop the\nmathematical description based on a master-equation and techniques for\nreconstruction of the cleavage specificity inherent to proteins and the\nproteasomal translocation rates, which are a property of the proteasome specie,\nfrom mass spectroscopy data on digestion patterns. With these properties\ndetermined, one can quantitatively predict digestion patterns for new\nexperimental set-ups.

The typical\nsearch time is calculated using scaling arguments which are verified\nnumerically. Our results suggest that the inclusion of intersegmental transfer\n(i) decreases the search time considerably (ii) makes the search time much more\nrobust to variations in the parameters of the model and (iii) that the optimal\nsearch time occurs in a regime very different than that found for models which\nignore intersegmental transfers.

We propose a generic kinetic description\nof coat assembly and the formation of coated vesicles, and discuss its\nimplication to the dynamics of COP vesicles that traffic within the Golgi and\nwith the Endoplasmic Reticulum. We show that stationary coats of fixed area\nemerge from the competition between coat growth and the recycling of coat\ncomponents, in a fashion resembling the treadmilling of cytoskeletal filaments.\nWe further show that the turnover of coat components allows for a highly\nsensitive switching mechanism between a quiescent and a vesicle producing\nmembrane, upon a slowing down of the exchange kinetics. We claim that the\nexistence of this switching behaviour, also triggered by factors such as the\npresence of cargo and variation of the membrane mechanical tension, allows for\nefficient regulation of vesicle secretion. We propose a model, supported by\ndifferent experimental observations, in which vesiculation of secretory\nmembranes is impaired by the energy consuming desorption of coat proteins,\nuntil the presence of cargo or other factors triggers a dynamical switch into a\nvesicle producing state.\n",

        "summary": "  Motor enzymes are remarkable molecular machines that use the energy derived\nfrom the hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate to generate mechanical\nmovement, achieved through different steps that constitute their kinetic cycle.\nThese macromolecules, nowadays investigated with advanced experimental\ntechniques to unveil their molecular mechanisms and the properties of their\nkinetic cycles, are implicated in many biological processes, ranging from\nbiopolymerisation (e.g. RNA polymerases and ribosomes) to intracellular\ntransport (motor proteins such as kinesins or dyneins). Although the kinetics\nof individual motors is well studied on both theoretical and experimental\ngrounds, the repercussions of their stepping cycle on the collective dynamics\nstill remains unclear. Advances in this direction will improve our\ncomprehension of transport process in the natural intracellular medium, where\nprocessive motor enzymes might operate in crowded conditions. In this work, we\ntherefore extend the current statistical kinetic analysis to study collective\ntransport phenomena of motors in terms of lattice gas models belonging to the\nexclusion process class. Via numerical simulations, we show how to interpret\nand use the randomness calculated from single particle trajectories in crowded\nconditions. Importantly, we also show that time fluctuations and non-Poissonian\nbehavior are intrinsically related to spatial correlations and the emergence of\nlarge, but finite, clusters of co-moving motors. The properties unveiled by our\nanalysis have important biological implications on the collective transport\ncharacteristics of processive motor enzymes in crowded conditions.\n",

This also affects the lateral interaction and bending\nenergies and, thus, the mechanical equilibrium state of the microtubule. As\nhydrolysis gives rise to conformational changes in dimers, mechanical forces\nalso influence the hydrolysis rates by mechanical energy changes modulating the\nhydrolysis rate. The interaction via the microtubule mechanics then gives rise\nto correlation effects in the hydrolysis dynamics, which have not been taken\ninto account before. Assuming a dominant influence of mechanical energies on\nhydrolysis rates, we investigate the most probable hydrolysis pathways both for\nvectorial and random hydrolysis. Investigating the stability with respect to\nlateral bond rupture, we identify initiation configurations for catastrophes\nalong the hydrolysis pathways and values for a lateral bond rupture force.

The cytoskeletal\nbinding sites are in contact with the same finite reservoir of motors (either\nthe cytosol or the flow chamber) and hence compete for recruiting the available\nmotors, potentially depleting the reservoir and affecting cytoskeletal\ntransport. In this work we provide a theoretical framework to study,\nanalytically and numerically, how motor density profiles and crowding along\ncytoskeletal filaments depend on the competition of motors for their binding\nsites. We propose two models in which finite processive motor proteins actively\nadvance along cytoskeletal filaments and are continuously exchanged with the\nmotor pool. We first look at homogeneous reservoirs and then examine the\neffects of free motor diffusion in the surrounding medium. We consider as a\nreference situation recent in vitro experimental setups of kinesin-8 motors\nbinding and moving along microtubule filaments in a flow chamber. We\ninvestigate how the crowding of linear motor proteins moving on a filament can\nbe regulated by the balance between supply (concentration of motor proteins in\nthe flow chamber) and demand (total number of polymerised tubulin\nheterodimers). We present analytical results for the density profiles of bound\nmotors, the reservoir depletion, and propose novel phase diagrams that present\nthe formation of jams of motor proteins on the filament as a function of two\ntuneable experimental parameters: the motor protein concentration and the\nconcentration of tubulins polymerized into cytoskeletal filaments.

Local fluctuations in the number of\ncalcium ions play a crucial role in the onset of these features. Previous\nmodeling studies of calcium puff dynamics stemming from IP$_3$R channels have\npredominantly focused on stochastic channel models coupled to deterministic\ndiffusion of ions, thereby neglecting local fluctuations of the ion number.\nTracking of individual ions is computationally difficult due to the scale\nseparation in the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration when channels are in the open or\nclosed states.

Given the importance of accurate copying at the molecular scale, it\nis fundamental to understand its thermodynamic features.

Here, we propose a new biophysical mechanism that can\nestablish and maintain robust yet plastic epigenetic domains via genomic\nbookmarking (GBM). We model chromatin as a recolourable polymer whose segments\nbear non-permanent histone marks (or colours) which can be modified by \"writer\"\nproteins. The three-dimensional chromatin organisation is mediated by protein\nbridges, or \"readers\", such as Polycomb Repressive Complexes and Transcription\nFactors. The coupling between readers and writers drives spreading of\nbiochemical marks and sustains the memory of local chromatin states across\nreplication and mitosis. In contrast, GBM-targeted perturbations destabilise\nthe epigenetic patterns. Strikingly, we demonstrate that GBM alone can explain\nthe full distribution of Polycomb marks in a whole Drosophila chromosome. We\nfinally suggest that our model provides a starting point for an understanding\nof the biophysics of cellular differentiation and reprogramming.\n",

In an attempt to fill\nthis gap we followed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by\ndissecting and modulating cargo binding, internalization and cellular response\nmediated by KDEL receptors (KDELRs) at the mammalian cell surface after\ninteraction with a model cargo/ligand. Using a fluorescent variant of ricin\ntoxin A chain as KDELR-ligand, eGFP-RTA (H/KDEL), we demonstrate that cargo\nbinding induces dose-dependent receptor cluster formation at and subsequent\ninternalization from the membrane which is associated and counteracted by\nanterograde and microtubule-assisted receptor transport to preferred docking\nsites at the plasma membrane.

While the steady-state behavior of the pathway\nstimulated by a time-invariant signal is relatively well-understood, we show\nusing a computational model that it exhibits a rich repertoire of transient\nadaptive responses to changes in stimuli. When the signal is switched on, the\nresponse is characterized by long-lived modulations in frequency as well as\namplitude. On withdrawing the stimulus, the activity decays over timescales\nmuch longer than that of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes,\nexhibiting reverberations characterized by repeated spiking in the activated\nMAPK concentration. The long-term persistence of such post-stimulus activity\nsuggests that the cascade retains memory of the signal for a significant\nduration following its removal, even in the absence of any explicit feedback or\ncross-talk with other pathways. We find that the molecular mechanism underlying\nthis behavior is related to the existence of distinct relaxation rates for the\ndifferent cascade components. This results in the imbalance of fluxes between\ndifferent layers of the cascade, with the repeated reuse of activated kinases\nas enzymes when they are released from sequestration in complexes leading to\none or more spike events following the removal of the stimulus.

The plus-end\nof all the MTs in the bundle are permanently attached to a movable `wall' by a\ndevice whose detailed structure is not treated explicitly in our model. The\nonly requirement is that the device allows polymerization and depolymerization\nof each MT at the plus-end. In spite of the absence of external force and\ndirect lateral interactions between the MTs, the group of polymerizing MTs\nattached to the wall create a load force against the group of depolymerizing\nMTs and vice-versa; the load against a group is shared equally by the members\nof that group. Such indirect interactions among the MTs gives rise to the rich\nvariety of possible states of collective dynamics that we have identified by\ncomputer simulations of the model in different parameter regimes. The\nbi-directional motion of the cargo, caused by the load-dependence of the\npolymerization kinetics, is a \"proof-of-principle\" that the bi-directional\nmotion of chromosomes before cell division does not necessarily need active\nparticipation of motor proteins.\n",

Each of the two\nensembles is described by the parallel cluster model that allows us to use\nexact stochastic simulations and at the same time to keep important molecular\ndetails of the myosin II cross-bridge cycle. Our simulation and analytical\nresults reveal a strong dependence of myosin II minifilament dynamics on\nenvironmental stiffness that is reminiscent of the cellular response to\nsubstrate stiffness. For small stiffness, minifilaments form transient\ncrosslinks exerting short spikes of force with negligible mean. For large\nstiffness, minifilaments form near permanent crosslinks exerting a mean force\nwhich hardly depends on environmental elasticity. This functional switch arises\nbecause dissociation after the power stroke is suppressed by force (catch\nbonding) and because ensembles can no longer perform the power stroke at large\nforces. Symmetric myosin II minifilaments perform a random walk with an\neffective diffusion constant which decreases with increasing ensemble size, as\ndemonstrated for rigid substrates with an analytical treatment.\n",

One of the species of particles\n($P$) represents RNAP motors while the other ($R$) represents replication\nforks. Motivated by the biological phenomena that this model is intended to\ncapture, a maximum of only two $R$ particles are allowed to enter the lattice\nfrom two opposite ends whereas the unrestricted number of $P$ particles\nconstitute a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a segment\nin the middle of the lattice. Consequently, the lattice consists of three\nsegments; the encounters of the $P$ particles with the $R$ particles are\nconfined within the middle segment (segment $2$) whereas only the $R$ particles\ncan occupy the sites in the segments $1$ and $3$. The model captures three\ndistinct pathways for resolving the co-directional as well as head-collision\nbetween the $P$ and $R$ particles. Using Monte Carlo simulations and heuristic\nanalytical arguments that combine exact results for the TASEP with mean-field\napproximations, we predict the possible outcomes of the conflict between the\ntraffic of RNAP motors ($P$ particles engaged in transcription) and the\nreplication forks ($R$ particles). The outcomes, of course, depend on the\ndynamical phase of the TASEP of $P$ particles. In principle, the model can be\nadapted to the experimental conditions to account for the data quantitatively.\n",

After chemical, the next most important cue is\nmechanical, and protein complexes that produce or enable a chemical signal in\nresponse to a mechanical stimulus are called mechanosensors. There is a sharp\ndistinction between sensing an external force or pressure/tension applied to\nthe cell, and sensing the mechanical stiffness of the environment. We call the\nfirst mechanosensitivity of the 1st kind, and the latter mechanosensitivity of\nthe 2nd kind. There are two variants of protein complexes that act as\nmechanosensors of the 2nd kind: producing either a one-off or a reversible\naction. The latent complex of TGF-$\\beta$ is an example of the one-off action:\non the release of active TGF-$\\beta$ signal, the complex is discarded and needs\nto be replaced. In contrast, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in a complex with\nintegrin is a reversible mechanosensor, which initiates the chemical signal in\nits active phosphorylated conformation, but can spontaneously return to its\nclosed folded conformation. Here we study the physical mechanism of the\nreversible mechanosensor of the 2nd kind, using FAK as a practical example. We\nfind how the rates of conformation changes depend on the substrate stiffness\nand the pulling force applied from the cell cytoskeleton.

They undergo active\nregular oscillatory beating patterns that can propel cells, such as the algae\nChlamydomonas, through fluids. When many cilia beat in synchrony they can also\npropel fluid along the surfaces of cells, as is the case of nodal cilia.\n  The main structural elements inside the cilium are microtubules. There are\nalso molecular motors of the dynein family that actively power the motion of\nthe cilium. These motors transform chemical energy in the form of ATP into\nmechanical forces that produce sliding displacement between the microtubules.\nThis sliding is converted to bending by constraints at the base and/or along\nthe length of the cilium. Forces and displacements within the cilium can\nregulate dyneins and provide a feedback mechanism: the dyneins generate forces,\ndeforming the cilium; the deformations, in turn, regulate the dyneins. This\nfeedback is believed to be the origin of the coordination of dyneins in space\nand time which underlies the regularity of the beat pattern.\n  Goals and approach. While the mechanism by which dyneins bend the cilium is\nunderstood, the feedback mechanism is much less clear. The two key questions\nare: which forces and displacements are the most relevant in regulating the\nbeat? and how exactly does this regulation occur?\n  In this thesis we develop a framework to describe the spatio-temporal\npatterns of a cilium with different mechanisms of motor regulation.\nCharacterizing and comparing the predicted shapes and beat patterns of these\ndifferent mechanisms to those observed in experiments provides us with further\nunderstanding on how dyneins are regulated.

Many of its features are not yet understood, some are,\nhowever, known to be critical for robust, reliable neural communication. In\nparticular, some synapses feature a re-uptake mechanism at the presynaptic\nneuron, which provides a means for removing neurotransmitters from the synaptic\ncleft and for recycling them for future reuse. In this paper, we develop a\ncomprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC encompassing a spatial model of\nthe synaptic cleft, molecule re-uptake at the presynaptic neuron, and\nreversible binding to individual receptors at the postsynaptic neuron. Based on\nthis model, we derive an analytical time domain expression for the channel\nimpulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system.

We demonstrate that, in single-step\nreactions, the two discrimination mechanisms are strictly alternative and can\nnot be mixed to further reduce the error fraction. Close to the lowest error\nlimit, kinetic discrimination results in a diverging copying velocity and\ndissipation per copied bit. On the opposite, energetic discrimination reaches\nits lowest error limit in an adiabatic regime where dissipation and velocity\nvanish. By analyzing experimentally measured kinetic rates of two DNA\npolymerases, T7 and Pol{\\gamma}, we argue that one of them operates in the\nkinetic and the other in the energetic regime.

These motors\ngenerate forces and torques that slide and bend the microtubule doublets within\nthe axoneme. To create regular waveforms the activities of the dyneins must be\ncoordinated. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses due to\nradial, transverse, or sliding deformations, that build up within the moving\naxoneme. However, which particular component of the stress regulates the motors\nto produce the observed flagellar waveforms remains an open question. To\naddress this question, we describe the axoneme as a three-dimensional bundle of\nfilaments and characterize its mechanics. We show that regulation of the motors\nby radial and transverse stresses can lead to a coordinated flagellar motion\nonly in the presence of twist. By comparison, regulation by shear stress is\npossible without twist. We calculate emergent beating patterns in twisted\naxonemes resulting from regulation by transverse stresses. The waveforms are\nsimilar to those observed in flagella of Chlamydomonas and sperm. Due to the\ntwist, the waveform has non-planar components, which result in swimming\ntrajectories such as twisted ribbons and helices that agree with observations.\n",

ATPase is\ncomposed of two rotary motors, F0 and F1, which generate the opposing rotation\nand compete for control of their shared central gamma-shaft. Here we present a\nself-consistent physical model of the F1 motor as a simplified two-state\nBrownian ratchet based on the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the\ncoiled-coil gamma-shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical description\nof linear and rotary motors and explains the stepped unidirectional rotation of\nthe $\\gamma$-shaft, in agreement with the `binding-change' ideas of Boyer.\nSubstituting the model parameters, all independently known from recent\nexperiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e.g. the\n`no-load' angular velocity is ca. 400~rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP, in close\nagreement with experiment. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F0 can slow,\nstop and overcome the torque generated by F1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to\nsynthesis at a very low value of `stall torque'.

The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) links the\nbiophysical attachment status of the kinetochores to mitotic progression, and\nensures that even a single misaligned kinetochore keeps the checkpoint active.\nThe mechanism by which this is achieved is still elusive. Current computational\nmodels of the human SAC disregard important biochemical properties by omitting\nany kind of feedback loop, proper kinetochore signals, and other spatial\nproperties such as the stability of the system and diffusion effects. To allow\nfor more realistic in silico study of the dynamics of the SAC model, a minimal\nmathematical framework for SAC activation and silencing is introduced.

        "summary": "  Biomolecular condensates in cells are often rich in catalytically-active\nenzymes. This is particularly true in the case of the large enzymatic complexes\nknown as metabolons, which contain different enzymes that participate in the\nsame catalytic pathway. One possible explanation for this self-organization is\nthe combination of the catalytic activity of the enzymes and a chemotactic\nresponse to gradients of their substrate, which leads to a substrate-mediated\neffective interaction between enzymes. These interactions constitute a purely\nnon-equilibrium effect and show exotic features such as non-reciprocity. Here,\nwe analytically study a model describing the phase separation of a mixture of\nsuch catalytically-active particles. We show that a Michaelis-Menten-like\ndependence of the particles' activities manifests itself as a screening of the\ninteractions, and that a mixture of two differently-sized active species can\nexhibit phase separation with transient oscillations. We also derive a rich\nstability phase diagram for a mixture of two species with both\nconcentration-dependent activity and size dispersity. This work highlights the\nvariety of possible phase separation behaviours in mixtures of\nchemically-active particles, which provides an alternative pathway to the\npassive interactions more commonly associated with phase separation in cells.\nOur results highlight non-equilibrium organizing principles that can be\nimportant for biologically relevant liquid-liquid phase separation.\n",

        "summary": "  A highly organized and densely packed lattice of molecular machinery within\nthe sarcomeres of muscle cells powers contraction. Although many of the\nproteins that drive contraction have been studied extensively, the mechanical\nimpact of fluid shearing within the lattice of molecular machinery has received\nminimal attention. It was recently proposed that fluid flow augments substrate\ntransport in the sarcomere, however, this analysis used analytical models of\nfluid flow in the molecular machinery that could not capture its full\ncomplexity. By building a finite element model of the sarcomere, we estimate\nthe explicit flow field, and contrast it with analytical models. Our results\ndemonstrate that viscous drag forces on sliding filaments are surprisingly\nsmall in contrast to the forces generated by single myosin molecular motors.\nThis model also indicates that the energetic cost of fluid flow through viscous\nshearing with lattice proteins is likely minimal. The model also highlights a\nsteep velocity gradient between sliding filaments and demonstrates that the\nmaximal radial fluid velocity occurs near the tips of the filaments. To our\nknowledge, this is the first computational analysis of fluid flow within the\nhighly structured sarcomere.\n",

Yet how voltage changes at such a small scale in vivo remains\nchallenging due to the experimental diffraction limit, large signal\nfluctuations and the still limited resolution of fast voltage indicators. Here,\nwe study the voltage distribution in nano-compartments using a computational\napproach based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for the electro-diffusion\nmotion of ions, where inward and outward fluxes are generated between channels.\nWe report a current-voltage (I-V) logarithmic relationship generalizing Nernst\nlaw that reveals how the local membrane curvature modulates the voltage. We\nfurther find that an influx current penetrating a cellular electrolyte can lead\nto perturbations from tens to hundreds of nanometers deep depending on the\nlocal channels organization. Finally, we show that the neck resistance of\ndendritic spines can be completely shunted by the transporters located on the\nhead boundary, facilitating ionic flow. To conclude, we propose that voltage is\nregulated at a subcellular level by channels organization, membrane curvature\nand narrow passages.\n",

        "summary": "  Live-cell imaging of multiple subcellular structures is essential for\nunderstanding subcellular dynamics. However, the conventional multi-color\nsequential fluorescence microscopy suffers from significant imaging delays and\nlimited number of subcellular structure separate labeling, resulting in\nsubstantial limitations for real-time live-cell research applications. Here, we\npresent the Adaptive Explainable Multi-Structure Network (AEMS-Net), a\ndeep-learning framework that enables simultaneous prediction of two subcellular\nstructures from a single image. The model normalizes staining intensity and\nprioritizes critical image features by integrating attention mechanisms and\nbrightness adaptation layers. Leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation\ntheorem, our model decomposes learned features into interpretable univariate\nfunctions, enhancing the explainability of complex subcellular morphologies. We\ndemonstrate that AEMS-Net allows real-time recording of interactions between\nmitochondria and microtubules, requiring only half the conventional\nsequential-channel imaging procedures. Notably, this approach achieves over 30%\nimprovement in imaging quality compared to traditional deep learning methods,\nestablishing a new paradigm for long-term, interpretable live-cell imaging that\nadvances the ability to explore subcellular dynamics.\n",

        "summary": "  Many imaging techniques for biological systems -- like fixation of cells\ncoupled with fluorescence microscopy -- provide sharp spatial resolution in\nreporting locations of individuals at a single moment in time but also destroy\nthe dynamics they intend to capture. These snapshot observations contain no\ninformation about individual trajectories, but still encode information about\nmovement and demographic dynamics, especially when combined with a\nwell-motivated biophysical model. The relationship between spatially evolving\npopulations and single-moment representations of their collective locations is\nwell-established with partial differential equations (PDEs) and their inverse\nproblems. However, experimental data is commonly a set of locations whose\nnumber is insufficient to approximate a continuous-in-space PDE solution. Here,\nmotivated by popular subcellular imaging data of gene expression, we embrace\nthe stochastic nature of the data and investigate the mathematical foundations\nof parametrically inferring demographic rates from snapshots of particles\nundergoing birth, diffusion, and death in a nuclear or cellular domain. Toward\ninference, we rigorously derive a connection between individual particle paths\nand their presentation as a Poisson spatial process. Using this framework, we\ninvestigate the properties of the resulting inverse problem and study factors\nthat affect quality of inference. One pervasive feature of this experimental\nregime is the presence of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Rather than being a\nhindrance, we show that cell-to-cell geometric heterogeneity can increase the\nquality of inference on dynamics for certain parameter regimes. Altogether, the\nresults serve as a basis for more detailed investigations of subcellular\nspatial patterns of RNA molecules and other stochastically evolving populations\nthat can only be observed for single instants in their time evolution.\n",
