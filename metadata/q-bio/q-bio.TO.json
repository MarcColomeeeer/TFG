Methods and materials: 20 patients (with 2 and 3\ndegrees of ventilating infringements (VC<73%, FEV1<51%, MVV<56%), without\nrestrictive disease of lungs, suffering from bronchial asthma were studied\nbefore and after BI by plotting volume, rate flow, against the transpulmonare\npressure. About the change of nonequality of ventilating we consider by the\nchange after BI of Cdyn, Cdyn at once after flow interruption (Cdyn1), tissue\nresistance at inhalation (Rti in) and exhalation (Rti ex), parameters of\nventilating and general parameters of respiratory mechanics. Results: the\nparameters of ventilating were improved (P < 0,05). General parameters of\nrespiratory mechanics also improved. Rti in and Rti ex are made 0,48+0,16;\n1,05+0,25 kPa/l/s before BI and decreased 0,09+0,04; 0,28+0,09 kPa/l/s after BI\n(P < 0,05; P < 0,05). But Cdyn and Cdyn1 are not changed after BI. Conclusions:\n1. The decrease of ventilation nonequality and tissue friction after BI do not\ninfluence on the initially reduced dynamic compliance of lungs at asthma\npatients without any restrictive diseases of lungs. 2. The cause of not\nincreasing of dynamic compliance after BI probably due by changes in elastic\ncomponent of parenchyma of lungs, insensitive to berotec.\n",

If crisis brought on by telomere shortening is\nnecessary for most human carcinomas, it may also be the rate limiting step. To\ntest this, we compared a mathematical model in which telomere loss is the rate\nlimiting step during carcinogenesis with age-incidence data compiled by the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. We found that this\nmodel adequately explains the age-incidence data. The model also implies that\ntwo distinct paths exist for carcinoma to develop in prostate, breast, and\novary tissues.

        "summary": "  We describe an asymptotic approach to gated ionic models of single-cell\ncardiac excitability. It has a form essentially different from the Tikhonov\nfast-slow form assumed in standard asymptotic reductions of excitable systems.\nThis is of interest since the standard approaches have been previously found\ninadequate to describe phenomena such as the dissipation of cardiac wave fronts\nand the shape of action potential at repolarization. The proposed asymptotic\ndescription overcomes these deficiencies by allowing, among other non-Tikhonov\nfeatures, that a dynamical variable may change its character from fast to slow\nwithin a single solution. The general asymptotic approach is best demonstrated\non an example which should be both simple and generic. The classical model of\nPurkinje fibers (Noble, 1962) has the simplest functional form of all cardiac\nmodels but according to the current understanding it assigns a physiologically\nincorrect role to the Na current. This leads us to suggest an ``Archetypal\nModel'' with the simplicity of the Noble model but with a structure more\ntypical to contemporary cardiac models. We demonstrate that the Archetypal\nModel admits a complete asymptotic solution in quadratures. To validate our\nasymptotic approach, we proceed to consider an exactly solvable ``caricature''\nof the Archetypal Model and demonstrate that the asymptotic of its exact\nsolution coincides with the solutions obtained by substituting the\n``caricature'' right-hand sides into the asymptotic solution of the generic\nArchetypal Model. This is necessary, because, unlike in standard asymptotic\ndescriptions, no general results exist which can guarantee the proximity of the\nnon-Tikhonov asymptotic solutions to the solutions of the corresponding\ndetailed ionic model.\n",

Analyzing vessel\nformation and elongation towards the concentration gradient of the\ntumor-derived angiogenetic basic fibroblast growth factor, bFGF, we assumed\nthat prior to the blood vessels reaching the tumor surface, the resulting\npattern of tumor growth is symmetric, circular with a common center point.\nHowever, after the vessels reach the tumor surface, we assumed that the growth\nrate of that particular cancer region is accelerated compared to the tumor\nsurface section that lacks neo-vascularization. Therefore, the resulting\nasymmetric tumor growth pattern is biased towards the site of the nourishing\nvessels. The simulation results show over time an increase in vessel density, a\ndecrease in vessel branching length, and an increase in fracticality of the\nvascular branching architecture. Interestingly, over time the fractal dimension\ndisplayed a sigmoidal pattern with a reduced rate increase at earlier and later\ntumor growth stages due to distinct characteristics in vessel length and\ndensity. The finding that, at later stages, higher vascular fracticality\nresulted in a marked increase of tumor slice volume provides further in silico\nevidence for a functional impact of vascular patterns on cancer growth.\n",

We show that the generic dynamical behavior of\nbody composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two classes. In the\nfirst class, the body composition and mass are determined uniquely. In the\nsecond class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible\nstates. Surprisingly, perturbations of dietary energy intake or energy\nexpenditure can give identical responses in both model classes and existing\ndata are insufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities.

In this study, we construct a mathematical model for\nan islet consisting of two-state alpha-, beta-, and delta-cells, and analyze\neffects of known chemical interactions between them with emphasis on the\ncombined effects of those interactions. In particular, such features as\nparacrine signals of neighboring cells and cell-to-cell variations in response\nto external glucose concentrations as well as glucose dynamics, depending on\ninsulin and glucagon hormone, are considered explicitly. Our model predicts\nthree possible benefits of the cell-to-cell interactions: First, the asymmetric\ninteraction between alpha- and beta-cells contributes to the dynamic stability\nwhile the perturbed glucose level recovers to the normal level. Second, the\ninhibitory interactions of delta-cells for glucagon and insulin secretion\nprevent the wasteful co-secretion of them at the normal glucose level. Finally,\nthe glucose dose-responses of insulin secretion is modified to become more\npronounced at high glucose levels due to the inhibition by delta-cells.

Whereas biologists have proposed models where the shape is\ncontrolled on a molecular level [1], physicists, following Turing [2] and\nd'Arcy Thomson [3], have developed theories where patterns arise spontaneously\n[4]. Here, we propose a volume constraint that restricts the possible shapes of\nleaves. Focusing on palmate leaves, the central observation is that developing\nleaves first grow folded inside a bud, limited by the previous and subsequent\nleaves. We show that growing folded in this small volume controls globally the\nleaf development. This induces a direct relationship between the way it was\nfolded and the final unfolded shape of the leaf. These dependencies can be\napproximated as simple geometrical relationships that we confirm on both folded\nembryonic and unfolded mature leaves. We find that independently of their\nposition in the phylogenetic tree, these relationships work for folded species,\nbut do not work for non-folded species. This steric constraint is a simple way\nto impose a global regulation for the leaf growth. Such steric regulation\nshould be more general and considered as a new simple means of global\nregulation.\n",

However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as\nfibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as 'damage' and 'fault' are not\nspecified. Therefore we introduce some crucial modifications of this theory and\narrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is the result of accumulation of\nMisrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original\ndamage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at\ndifferent levels, however aging of the body takes place necessarily on the\ntissue level, but not requiring the aging of cells/molecules. The\nMisrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper unifies the\nunderstanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation,\nand multicellular structure in the aging process. This theory gives\nexplanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, the difference of\nlongevity in different species, and it is consistent with the physical view on\ncomplex systems.\n",

Previous studies have shown\nthat beta-adrenergic stimulation increases QT/RR slope, but the effects of\nbeta-adrenergic stimulation on QT/RR slope in heart failure are unknown.\nMethods: New Zealand White rabbits underwent coronary ligation (n=15) or sham\nsurgery (n=11), and implantation of a pediatric pacemaker lead in the right\nventricle for chronic ECG recording. Eight weeks after surgery, unsedated\nrabbits were given intravenous administrations of 0.25 to 2.0 ml of 1\nmicromol/l isoprenaline, while peak QRS to QRS (RR) and Q to T peak (QT)\nintervals were measured. Results: Ligated rabbits (n=6) had lower LVEF than\nsham rabbits (n=7, p<.0001), but similar baseline RR (269 +/- 15 vs 292 +/- 23\nms, p=.07), QT (104 +/- 17 vs 91 +/- 9 ms, p=.1) and minimum RR (204 +/- 11 vs\n208 +/- 6 ms, p=.4) intervals induced by isoprenaline (0.79 +/- 0.18 vs 0.73\n+/- 0.14 ml, p=.6). Hysteresis in QT vs TQ interval plots displayed biphasic\nrestitution and regions of negative slope. The slope of the positive slope\nregion was >1 in ligated rabbits (1.27 +/- 0.66) and <1 in sham rabbits (0.35\n+/- 0.14, p=.004). Absolute value of the negative slope was greater in ligated\nrabbits (-0.81 +/- 0.52 vs -0.35 +/- 0.14, p=.04). Conclusion: Ischaemic heart\nfailure produces steeper restitution slopes during beta-adrenergically induced\nQT/TQ hysteresis.

An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires\nsolving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which\nin the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods.\nWe compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic\nexcitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models.

In this work, we apply the method of generalized\nmodelling to systematically analyse a large class of models of bone remodeling.\nOur analysis shows that osteoblast precursors can play an important role in the\nregulation of bone remodeling. Further, we find that the parameter regime most\nlikely realized in nature lies very close to bifurcation lines, marking\nqualitative changes in the dynamics. Although proximity to a bifurcation\nfacilitates adaptive responses to changing external conditions, it entails the\ndanger of losing dynamical stability. Some evidence implicates such dynamical\ntransitions as a potential mechanism leading to forms of Paget's disease.\n",

The concentration of AMH in blood may also reflect the non-growing\nfollicle (NGF) population, i.e. the ovarian reserve, and be of value in\npredicting reproductive lifespan. A full description of AMH production up to\nthe menopause has not been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: By\nsearching the published literature for AMH concentrations in healthy\npre-menopausal females, and using our own data (combined n = 3,260) we have\ngenerated and robustly validated the first model of AMH concentration from\nconception to menopause. This model shows that 34% of the variation in AMH is\ndue to age alone. We have shown that AMH peaks at age 24.5 years, followed by a\ndecline to the menopause. We have also shown that there is a neonatal peak and\na potential pre-pubertal peak. Our model allows us to generate normative data\nat all ages. Conclusions/Significance: These data highlight key inflection\npoints in ovarian follicle dynamics. This first validated model of circulating\nAMH in healthy females describes a transition period in early adulthood, after\nwhich AMH reflects the progressive loss of the NGF pool. The existence of a\nneonatal increase in gonadal activity is confirmed for females. An improved\nunderstanding of the relationship between circulating AMH and age will lead\nmore accurate assessment of ovarian reserve for the individual woman.\n",

The objective of this study is to model the\nage-related population of NGFs in the human ovary from conception to menopause.\nData were taken from eight separate quantitative histological studies (n = 325)\nin which NGF populations at known ages from seven weeks post conception to 51\nyears (median 32 years) were calculated. The data set was fitted to 20 peak\nfunction models, with the results ranked by obtained r2 correlation\ncoefficient. The highest ranked model was chosen. Our model matches the\nlog-adjusted NGF population from conception to menopause to a five-parameter\nasymmetric double Gaussian cumulative (ADC) curve (r2 = 0.81). When restricted\nto ages up to 25 years, the ADC curve has r2 = 0.95. We estimate that for 95%\nof women by the age of 30 years only 12% of their maximum pre-birth NGF\npopulation is present and by the age of 40 years only 3% remains. Furthermore,\nwe found that the rate of NGF recruitment towards maturation for most women\nincreases from birth until approximately age 14 years then decreases towards\nthe menopause. To our knowledge, this is the first model of ovarian reserve\nfrom conception to menopause. This model allows us to estimate the number of\nNGFs present in the ovary at any given age, suggests that 81% of the variance\nin NGF populations is due to age alone, and shows for the first time, to our\nknowledge, that the rate of NGF recruitment increases from birth to age 14\nyears then declines with age until menopause. An increased understanding of the\ndynamics of human ovarian reserve will provide a more scientfic basis for\nfertility counselling for both healthy women and those who have survived\ngonadotoxic cancer treatments.\n",

The cells involved are bone resorbing\nosteoclasts, bone matrix producing osteoblasts and mechanosensing osteocytes.\nThese cells communicate with each other by means of autocrine and paracrine\nsignaling factors and operate in complex entities, the so-called bone\nmulticellular units (BMU). To investigate the BMU dynamics in silico, we\ndevelop a novel mathematical model resulting in a system of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations with time delays. The model describes the osteoblast and\nosteoclast populations together with the dynamics of the key messenger molecule\nRANKL and its decoy receptor OPG. Scaling theory is used to address parameter\nsensitivity and predict the emergence of pathological remodeling regimes. The\nmodel is studied numerically in one and two space dimensions using finite\ndifference schemes in space and explicit delay equation solvers in time. The\ncomputational results are in agreement with in vivo observations and provide\nnew insights into the role of the RANKL/OPG pathway in the spatial regulation\nof bone remodeling.\n",

        "summary": "  During embryonic development in vertebrates, left-right (L/R) asymmetry is\nreliably generated by a conserved mechanism: a L/R asymmetric signal is\ntransmitted from the embryonic node to other parts of the embryo by the L/R\nasymmetric expression and diffusion of the TGF-$\\beta$ related proteins Nodal\nand Lefty via propagating gene expression fronts in the lateral plate mesoderm\n(LPM) and midline. In zebrafish embryos, Nodal and Lefty expression can only\noccur along 3 narrow stripes that express the co-receptor \\emph{one-eyed\npinhead} (oep): Nodal along stripes in the left and right LPM, and Lefty along\nthe midline. In wild-type embryos, Nodal is only expressed in the left LPM but\nnot the right, because of inhibition by Lefty from the midline; however,\nbilateral Nodal expression occurs in loss-of-handedness mutants. A\ntwo-dimensional model of the zebrafish embryo predicts this loss of L/R\nasymmetry in oep mutants \\cite{henley-xu-burdine}. In this paper, we simplify\nthis two-dimensional picture to a one-dimensional model of Nodal and Lefty\nfront propagation along the oep-expressing stripes. We represent Nodal and\nLefty production by step functions that turn on when a linear function of Nodal\nand Lefty densities crosses a threshold. We do a parameter exploration of front\npropagation behavior, and find the existence of \\emph{pinned} intervals, along\nwhich the linear function underlying production is pinned to the threshold.\nFinally, we find parameter regimes for which spatially uniform oscillating\nsolutions are possible.\n",

The branching\nprocess during lung development has been studied in great detail and is\nremarkably stereotyped. The branched tree is generated by the sequential,\nnon-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain\nbranching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation). While many regulatory components\nand local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the\nregulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking. We have\ndeveloped a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of\nthe core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis. The model\nfocuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in\nexperiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well\nas the SHH receptor patched (Ptc). We show that the reported biochemical\ninteractions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that\nallows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\nThe kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental\ndata where available. The developed model is robust to small absolute and large\nrelative changes in the parameter values. At the same time there is a strong\nregulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be\nachieved by targeted changes in the parameter values. We note that the sequence\nof different branching events may also be the result of different growth\nspeeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours\nbifurcations in our model. We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is\nsufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes\n",

        "summary": "  The Sauropoda were the largest terrestrial animals ever to have lived on this\nplanet. As their nutritional requirements were so huge, their diet holds sway\nover the ecology of many Mesozoic herbivores. The diet of the sauropods is\nlimited by their feeding envelope, which in turn is governed by the posture and\nflexibility of their elongate necks. Yet the exact nature of the flexibility\nand posture of the neck has been a contentious issue. Previous studies have\nutilised computer models of dry bone, mechanical principles or the flexibility\nof the necks of extant animals. However, the effect of the musculature of the\nneck has yet to be investigated. Through measurements of the flexibility of the\nostrich neck after cumulative tissue removal, analyses of the muscle attachment\nsites of the ostrich and sauropods, and testing of the Osteological Neutral\nPose model, this study attempts to rectify this situation. The ostrich neck was\nshown to have three sections of flexibility; a slightly flexible anterior\nsection, a very flexible middle section and a stiff posterior section. The\nOsteological Neutral Pose did not show these sections, and was shown to\npotentially overestimate and underestimate flexibility. It was also found that\nthe inter-vertebral space could account for varying estimates of flexibility,\nand that sauropods would have proportionally more muscle mass at the base of\nthe neck in relation to the ostrich. Ultimately, it was shown that the tissues\nof the neck place the limits of flexibility, and that zygapophyseal overlap\ndoes not indicate the flexibility of the neck. Should the Osteological Neutral\nPose affect sauropod flexibility estimates in the same manner as that of the\nostrich (a general overestimate), then the sauropods would have a more limited\nfeeding envelope than previously thought, allowing for greater niche\npartitioning between groups.\n",

Older taxa require revision and new taxa\nawait description. The characteristic long necks of sauropods are mechanically\nperplexing and their evolution is obscure. All these issues are addressed\nherein.\n  The genus Brachiosaurus is represented by the American type species B.\naltithorax and the better known African species B. brancai. However,\nexamination of the overlapping material shows 26 differences between the\nspecies. B. brancai must be removed from Brachiosaurus and referred to the\ngenus Giraffatitan, which has been previously proposed for it.\n  Xenoposeidon proneneukos is a new neosauropod from the Lower Cretaceous\nHastings Bed Group, known from a single partial dorsal vertebra. The excellent\npreservation of the Xenoposeidon holotype reveals six unique characters. The\ndistinctive morphology suggests that Xenoposeidon may represent a new sauropod\nfamily, extending sauropod disparity as well as bringing to four the number of\nsauropod families known from the Wealden.\n  A second new Early Cretaceous genus is also described, a titanosauriform from\nthe Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, in Utah. This taxon is\nknown from at least two individuals, an adult and a juvenile, which together\nprovide vertebrae, ribs, a scapula, sternal plates and an ilium. The ilium is\nparticularly unusual, exhibiting five unique features.\n  The longest sauropod necks were five times as long as those of the next\nlongest terrestrial animals, and four separate lineages evolved necks exceeding\n10 m. Elongation was enabled by sheer size, vertebral pneumaticity and the\nrelative smallness of sauropod heads, despite aspects of cervical osteology\nthat are difficult to understand on mechanical first principles.\n",

Previous studies have found that an actomyosin ring (\"purse\nstring\") forms around the wound perimeter and contracts to close the wound over\nthe course of several dozens of minutes. Here, we report experiments that\nreveal an even faster mechanism which remarkably closes wounds by more than 50%\nwithin the first 30 seconds. Circular and elliptical wounds (~100 um in size)\nwere made in the blastoderm of early chick embryos and allowed to heal, with\nwound area and shape characterized as functions of time. The closure rate\ndisplayed a biphasic behavior, with rapid constriction lasting about a minute,\nfollowed by a period of more gradual closure to complete healing. Fluorescent\nstaining suggests that both healing phases are driven by actomyosin\ncontraction, with relatively rapid contraction of fibers at cell borders within\na relatively thick ring of tissue (several cells wide) around the wound\nfollowed by slower contraction of a thin supracellular actomyosin ring along\nthe margin, consistent with a purse string mechanism. Finite-element modeling\nshowed that this idea is biophysically plausible, with relatively isotropic\ncontraction within the thick ring giving way to tangential contraction in the\nthin ring. In addition, consistent with experimental results, simulated\nelliptical wounds heal with little change in aspect ratio, and decreased\nmembrane tension can cause these wounds to open briefly before going on to\nheal. These results provide new insight into the healing mechanism in embryonic\nepithelia.\n",

As such, the skin must maintain a homeostatic\nbalance in the face of many microenvironmental and genetic perturbations. At\nits simplest, skin homeostasis is maintained by the balance between skin cell\ngrowth and death such that skin architecture is preserved. This study presents\na hybrid multiscale mathematical model of normal skin (vSkin). The model\nfocuses on key cellular and microenvironmental variables that regulate\nhomeostatic interactions among keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts, key\ncomponents of the skin. The model recapitulates normal skin structure, and is\nrobust enough to withstand physical as well as biochemical perturbations.\nFurthermore, the vSkin model revealed the important role of the skin\nmicroenvironment in melanoma initiation and progression. Our experiments showed\nthat dermal fibroblasts, which are an important source of growth factors in the\nskin, adopt a phenotype that facilitates cancer cell growth and invasion when\nthey become senescent. Based on these experimental results, we incorporated\nsenescent fibroblasts into vSkin model and showed that senescent fibroblasts\ntransform the skin microenvironment and enhance the growth and invasion of\nnormal melanocytes as well as early stage melanoma cells. These predictions are\nconsistent with our experimental results as well as clinical observations. Our\nco-culture experiments show that the senescent fibroblasts promote the growth\nand invasion of non-tumorigenic melanoma cells. We also observed increased\nproteolytic activity in stromal fields adjacent to melanoma lesions in human\nhistology. Collectively, senescent fibroblasts create a pro-oncogenic\nenvironment that synergizes with mutations to drive melanoma initiation and\nprogression and should therefore be considered as a potential future\ntherapeutic target.\n",

We report a systems biology\napproach to the modelling of the Cp- Cs profile using as loose analogy, the\nVerhulst model of population dynamics but formulated in the concentration\ndomain. The HM is conceptualized as an ecological organism that `colonizes' the\nresource zone of the plant cells driven by the potential supplied by the higher\nHM concentration in the substrate. The infinite occupation by the HM is limited\nby the eventual saturation of the cellular binding sites. The solution of the\ndifferential equation results in the logistic equation, the r-K model. The\nmodel is tested for 3 metalophillic plants T.erecta, S. vulgaris and E.\nsplendens growing in different types of substrates, contaminated to varying\nextents by different copper compounds. The model fitted the experimental Cp- Cs\nprofiles well. The r, K parameter values and secondary quantities derived from\nthem, allowed a quantification of the number of Cu binding sites per cell at\nsaturation, the sensitivities (affinities) of these sites for Cu in the 3\nexperimental systems as well as the extraction of information related to the\nsubstrate phyto-availability of the Cu. Thus even though the model operates at\nthe systems level it permits useful insights into underlying processes that\nultimately derive from the cumulative molecular processes of HM homeostasis.\nThe chief advantages of the model are its simplicity, fewer arbitrary\nparameters, and the non-specification of constraints on substrate and plant\ntype.\n",

How such\nspatial organization emerges on the growing long bone domain is still\nunresolved. Based on the reported biochemical interactions we developed a\nregulatory model for the core signaling factors IHH, PTCH1, and PTHrP and\nincluded two cell types, proliferating/resting chondrocytes and\n(pre-)hypertrophic chondrocytes. We show that the reported IHH-PTCH1\ninteraction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing kinetics, and that\ninclusion of PTHrP is important to achieve robust patterning when coupling\npatterning and tissue dynamics. The model reproduces relevant spatiotemporal\ngene expression patterns, as well as a number of relevant mutant phenotypes. In\nsummary, we propose that a ligand-receptor based Turing mechanism may control\nthe emergence of patterns during long bone development, with PTHrP as an\nimportant mediator to confer patterning robustness when the sensitive Turing\nsystem is coupled to the dynamics of a growing and differentiating tissue. We\nhave previously shown that ligand-receptor based Turing mechanisms can also\nresult from BMP-receptor and GDNF-receptor interactions, and that these\nreproduce the wildtype and mutant patterns during digit formation in limbs and\nbranching morphogenesis in lung and kidneys.

Stem and semi-differentiated cells may\ndivide to self-renew, undergo programmed death or progress to\nsemi-differentiated and fully differentiated cells respectively. The\nprobabilities of each of these events provide the most important parameters of\nthe model. Fully differentiated cells do not divide, but a proportion undergoes\nprogrammed death in each generation. Our previous models showed that failure of\nprogrammed death - for example, in tumorigenesis - could lead either to\nexponential growth in cell numbers or to growth to some plateau. Our new models\nincorporate plausible fluctuation in the parameters of the model and introduce\nnon-linearity by assuming that the parameters depend on the numbers of cells in\neach state of differentiation. We find that the model is characterized by\nbifurcation between increase in cell numbers to stable equilibrium or\n'explosive' exponential growth; in a restricted number of cases, there may be\nmultiple stable equilibria. Fluctuation in cell numbers undergoing programmed\ndeath, for example caused by tissue damage, generally makes exponential growth\nmore likely, as long as the size of the fluctuation exceeds a certain critical\nvalue for a sufficiently long period of time. In most cases, once exponential\ngrowth has started, this process is irreversible.

Current treatment strategies, however, may fail to maintain\nultradian oscillations in blood glucose concentration, an important element of\na healthy alimentary system. Building upon recent successes in mathematical\nmodeling of the human glucose-insulin system, we show that both food intake and\ninsulin therapy likely demand increasingly precise control over insulin\nsensitivity if oscillations at a healthy average glucose concentration are to\nbe maintained. We then suggest guidelines and personalized treatment options\nfor diabetic patients that maintain these oscillations. We show that for a type\nII diabetic, both blood glucose levels can be controlled and healthy\noscillations maintained when the patient gets an hour of daily exercise and is\nplaced on a combination of Metformin and sulfonylurea drugs. We note that\ninsulin therapy and an additional hour of exercise will reduce the patient's\nneed for sulfonylureas. Results of a modeling analysis suggest that a typical\ntype I diabetic's blood glucose levels can be properly controlled with a\nconstant insulin infusion between 0.45 and 0.7 microU/(ml*min). Lastly, we note\nthat all suggested strategies rely on existing clinical techniques and\nestablished treatment measures, and so could potentially be of immediate use in\nthe design of an artificial pancreas.\n",

For better understanding this theory, we discuss here in more\ndetails the new concept of Misrepair and the concept of accumulation of\nMisrepairs. I. Aging takes place uniquely on the systems that have a\nwell-defined structure: an organization of its sub-structures. Aging of a\nnon-living system is a result of accumulation of injuries (damage) of its\nstructure. II. A generalized concept of Misrepair is important for reaching to\na unified understanding of aging changes. In the situation of a severe injury,\nincorrect repair is a repair essential for maintaining structural integrity for\nincreasing the surviving chance of an organism. With the same mechanism as that\nin \"Misrepair of DNA\" , the term of \"Misrepair\" can be used for describing all\nkinds of incorrect repairs on different types of living structures, including\nmolecules, cells and tissues. A new concept of Misrepair is therefore proposed\nand defined as incorrect reconstruction of an injured living structure.\nMisrepair mechanism is beneficial for the survival of an organism, and it is\nessential for the survival of a species. III. Alteration of structure made by\nMisrepair is irreversible; therefore Misrepairs accumulate and disorganize\ngradually a structure, which appears as aging of it. Accumulation of Misrepairs\ntakes place on molecular, cellular and tissue levels respectively: on tissue\nlevel, it appears as disorganization of cells and extracellular matrixes\n(ECMs); on cellular level, it appears as deformation of cytoskeleton and change\nof cell shape; and on DNA, it appears as accumulation of DNA mutations and\nalteration of DNA sequence. An essential change in aging of an organism is an\nirreversible change of the spatial relationship between cells/ECMs in a tissue.\nIn conclusion, aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of Misrepairs\non tissue level.\n",

The APs in part of an\narterial wall are inhomogeneous on size and on distribution. In order to\nunderstand this in-homogeneity, the pathology of APs is analyzed by Misrepair\nmechanism, a mechanism proposed in our Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. I.\nIn general, development of an AP is a result of repair of injured endothelium.\nBecause of infusion and deposition of lipids beneath endothelial cells, the\nrepair has to be achieved by altered remodeling of local endothelium. Such a\nrepair is a Misrepair. During repair, smooth muscular cells (SMCs) are\nclustered and collagen fibers are produced to the lesion of endothelium for\nreconstructing an anchoring structure for endothelial cells and for forming a\nbarrier to isolate the lipids. II. Altered remodeling (Misrepair) makes the\nlocal part of endothelium have increased damage-sensitivity and reduced\nrepair-efficiency. Thus, this part of endothelium will have increased risk for\ninjuries, lipid-infusion, and Misrepairs. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs\nand focalized deposition of lipids result in development of a plaque. III. By a\nviscous circle between lipid-infusion and endothelium-Misrepair, growing of an\nAP is self-accelerating. Namely, once an AP develops, it grows in an increasing\nrate with time and it does not stop growing. Within part of an arterial wall,\nolder APs grow faster than younger ones. The oldest and the biggest AP is the\nmost threatening one in narrowing local vessel lumen. Therefore, the\nself-accelerated growing of an AP is a fatal factor in atherosclerosis. In\nconclusion, development of APs is focalized and self-accelerating, because it\nis a result of accumulation of Misrepairs of endothelium.\n",

However, the processes of how DNA changes are produced and\nhow they accumulate in somatic cells are not clear. DNA changes include two\ntypes: point DNA mutations and chromosome changes. However, point DNA mutations\n(DNA mutations) are the main type of DNA changes that can remain and accumulate\nin cells. Severe DNA injuries are the causes for DNA mutations. However,\nMisrepair of DNA is an essential process for transforming a DNA injury into a\nsurvivable and inheritable DNA mutation. In somatic cells, Misrepair of DNA is\nthe main source of DNA mutations. Since the surviving chance of a cell by\nMisrepair of DNA is low, accumulation of DNA mutations can take place only\npossibly in the cells that can proliferate. Tumors can only develop in the\ntissues that are regenerable. The accumulation of Misrepairs of DNA needs to\nproceed in many generations of cells, and cell transformation from a normal\ncell into a tumor cell is a slow and long process. However, once a cell is\ntransformed especially when it is malignantly transformed, the deficiency of\nDNA repair and the rapid cell proliferation will accelerate the accumulation of\nDNA mutations. The process of accumulation of DNA mutations is actually the\nprocess of aging of a genome DNA. Repeated cell injuries and repeated cell\nregenerations are the two preconditions for tumor-development. For cancer\nprevention, a moderate and flexible living style is advised.\n",

Tissue fibrosis is associated with aging of most of\nour organs, and it is the main pathology in arteriosclerosis, chronic\nbronchitis/emphysema, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The causes and\ncharacteristics of fibrosis are analyzed with Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism\nproposed in Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. Tissue fibrosis is known to be\na result of repairs of tissue by collagen fibers. A repair with collagen fibers\nis a manner of \"Misrepair\". The collagen fibers are used for replacing dead\ncells or disrupted extracellular matrixes (ECMs) including elastic fibers,\nmyofibers, and basement membrane. The progressive tissue fibrosis with age\nmanifests the essential role of Misrepair in aging, because it reveals three\nfacts: A. a process of Misrepair exists; B. Misrepairs are unavoidable; and C.\nMisrepairs accumulate. As a result of accumulation of Misrepairs of tissue with\ncollagen fibers, tissue fibrosis is focalized and self-accelerating, appearing\nas growing of spots of hyaline degeneration. Fibrosis results in stiffness or\natrophy of an organ and progressive failure of the organ. In arteriosclerosis,\nthe deposition of collagen fibers in arterial wall is for replacing disrupted\nelastic fibers or myofibers, however results in hardness of the wall. Wrinkle\nformation is part of skin fibrosis, and it may be a result of accumulation of\ncollagen fibers of different lengths. Senile hair-loss and hair-whitening are\nprobably consequence of dermal fibrosis. In conclusion, tissue fibrosis is a\nresult of accumulation of Misrepairs of tissue with collagen fibers, and the\nphenomenon of fibrosis is a powerful proof for the central role of Misrepair in\naging.\n",

Parameters are calibrated on the basis of different in vivo\nimmunocompromised Rag1-/- and wild-type (WT) BALB/c murine tumor growth\nexperiments. The model analysis supports that tumor vasculature normalization\ncan be a plausible and effective strategy to treat cancer when combined with\nappropriate immuno-stimulations.

Normalization of tumor blood vessels opens a therapeutic\nwindow of opportunity to augment the antitumor immune responses, as well as to\nreduce the intratumoral immunosuppression and induced-hypoxia due to vascular\nabnormalities. The potential success of normalizing tumor-associated\nvasculature closely depends on the effector cell recruitment dynamics and tumor\nsizes.

The role of specific protein\n1 (Sp1) was investigated by gain and loss of function (inhibitor, siRNA,\nexpression vector). We showed that TGF$\\beta$1 regulates mRNA levels of its own\nreceptors, and of Smad3 and Smad7. It modulates TGF$\\beta$ receptors\npost-transcriptionally by affecting their mRNA stability, but does not change\nthe Smad-3 and Smad-7 mRNA half-life span, suggesting a potential\ntranscriptional effect on these genes. Moreover, the transcriptional factor\nSp1, which is downregulated by TGF$\\beta$1, is involved in the repression of\nboth TGF$\\beta$ receptors but not in the modulation of Smad3 and Smad7.\nInterestingly, Sp1 ectopic expression permitted also to maintain a similar\nexpression pattern to early response to TGF$\\beta$ at 24 hours of treatment. It\nrestored the induction of Sox9 and COL2A1 and blocked the late response\n(repression of aggrecan, induction of COL1A1 and COL10A1).

        "summary": "  Age spots are the brown spots that develop in the skin but change in color\nand shape with time. To understand the mechanism of development of age spots,\ncharacteristics of age spots are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism\nintroduced in Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. An age spot is\npathologically a group of aggregated basal cells, which contain lipofuscin\nbodies. Accumulation of lipofuscin bodies is a sign of aging of a cell.\nCharacteristics of age spots include: inhomogeneity in distribution, growing\nflatly before becoming protruding, irregularity on shape, inhomogeneity on the\ncolor and on the protruding degree of a spot, and softness of a protruding\nspot. After analyzing these characteristics, we make a hypothesis on the\nprocess of development of an age spot. A. Aging of a tissue is the basis for\ndevelopment of age spots. B. A flat spot results from accumulation of\nlipofuscin containing cells. When an aged cell remains, this cell can\naccelerate the aging of its neighbor cells by increasing damage sensitivity and\nreducing repair efficiency of the local tissue. By a viscous circle, more and\nmore neighbor cells become aged and they form a flat spot, which has an\nirregular shape. C. A protruding spot develops when some of the cells in a flat\nspot die and release lipofuscin bodies. For the survival of an organism, the un\ndegradable lipofuscin bodies have to be isolated by a capsule made by fibrotic\nmembrane, for maintaining the structural integrity of local epidermis.\nSuccessive deaths of lipofuscin containing cells make the capsule include more\nand more dead substances by layers of fibrotic membrane. In this way, the spot\n\"grows\" in three-dimension, resulting in protruding of the spot. In conclusion,\ndevelopment of an age spot is a result of accumulation of aged cells in aged\nskin.\n",

With a new concept of Misrepair, this theory reaches a unified\nunderstanding of aging: aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of\nMisrepairs of its structure. Misrepair accumulation theory (MA theory) is\ndistinct and it can improve our understanding of life on several aspects. I. MA\ntheory is fundamentally different from other theories by: A. proposing a\ngeneralized concept of Misrepair; B. pointing out the evolutionary advantage of\naging mechanism; and C. distinguishing between aging of a cell and aging of a\ntissue. II. MA theory overcomes the limitations of traditional theories on\ninterpreting the phenomena of tissue fibrosis and cancer development. Tissue\nfibrosis, as a result of accumulation of Misrepairs with collagen fibers, is a\npowerful evidence for demonstrating the central role of Misrepairs in aging.\nCancer development is a result of accumulation of DNA Misrepairs in somatic\ncells, which needs to proceed over many generations of cells in a regenerable\ntissue. III. MA theory improves also our understanding on longevity, premature\naging, adaptation, and species evolution. The potential of longevity of an\norganism is hidden in the complexity of its structure. IV. MA theory suggests\nthat for retarding aging, the most important is to reduce the opportunity of\ndamage-exposure.\n",

This inherent interdependency between diverse\nbiological mechanisms, both on the same and on different scales, provides the\nfunctioning of an organism capable of maintaining homeostasis and physiological\nstability through numerous feedback loops. Thus, developing models of organisms\nand their constituents should be done within the overall systemic context of\nthe studied phenomena. We introduce such a method for modeling growth and\nregeneration of livers at the organ scale, considering it a part of the overall\nmulti-scale biochemical and biophysical processes of an organism. Our method is\nbased on the earlier discovered general growth law, postulating that any\nbiological growth process comprises a uniquely defined distribution of\nnutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass production. Based\non this law, we introduce a liver growth model that allows to accurately\npredicting the growth of liver transplants in dogs and liver grafts in humans.\nUsing this model, we find quantitative growth characteristics, such as the time\npoint when the transition period after surgery is over and the liver resumes\nnormal growth, rates at which hepatocytes are involved in proliferation, etc.\nWe then use the model to determine and quantify otherwise unobservable\nmetabolic properties of livers.\n",

The interactions between these oscillators generate a chaotic\nblood pressure waveform signal, where periods of apparent rhythmicity are\npunctuated by asynchronous behaviour. It is this variability which seems to\ncharacterise the normal state. We used a standard experimental data set for the\npurposes of analysis and modelling. Arterial blood pressure waveform data was\ncollected from conscious mice instrumented with radiotelemetry devices over\n$24$ hours, at a $100$ Hz and $1$ kHz time base. During a $24$ hour period,\nthese mice display diurnal variation leading to changes in the cardiovascular\nwaveform. We undertook preliminary analysis of our data using Fourier\ntransforms and subsequently applied a series of both linear and nonlinear\nmathematical approaches in parallel. We provide a minimalistic linear and\nnonlinear coupled oscillator model and employed spectral and Hilbert analysis\nas well as a phase plane analysis. This provides a route to a three way\nsynergistic investigation of the original blood pressure data by a combination\nof physiological experiments, data analysis viz. Fourier and Hilbert transforms\nand attractor reconstructions, and numerical solutions of linear and nonlinear\ncoupled oscillator models. We believe that a minimal model of coupled\noscillator models that quantitatively describes the complex physiological data\ncould be developed via such a method. Further investigations of each of these\ntechniques will be explored in separate publications.\n",

        "summary": "  Primary tumors infrequently lead to demise of cancer patients; instead,\nmortality and a significant degree of morbidity result from the growth of\nsecondary tumors in distant organs (metastasis). It is well-known that\nmalignant tumors induce the formation of a lymphatic and a blood vascular\nnetwork around themselves. A similar but far less studied process occurs in\nrelation to the nervous system and is referred to as \\emph{neoneurogenesis}; in\nfact, recent studies have demonstrated that tumors initiate their own\ninnervation. However, the relationship between tumor progression and the\nnervous system is still poorly understood. This process is most likely\nregulated by a multitude of factors in the tumor-nerve microenvironment and it\nis therefore important to study the interactions between the nervous system and\ntumor cells through mathematical/computational modelling: this may reveal the\nmost significant factors of the plethora of interacting elements regulating\nneoneurogenesis. The present work is a first attempt to model the\nneurobiological aspect of cancer development through a (simple) system of\ndifferential equations. The model confirms the experimental observations that a\ntumor is able to promote nerve formation/elongation around itself, and that\nhigh levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and axon guidance molecules (AGMs) are\nrecorded in the presence of a tumor. Our results also reflect the observation\nthat high stress levels (represented by higher norepinephrine release by\nsympathetic nerves) contribute to tumor development and spread, indicating a\nmutually beneficial relationship between tumor cells and neurons. The model\npredictions suggest novel therapeutic strategies, aimed at blocking the stress\neffects on tumor growth and dissemination.\n",

There are three types of senile cataract:\ncortical cataract, nuclear cataract, and posterior/anterior sub-capsular\ncataract. The most common senile cataract is cortical cataract. For\nunderstanding cortical cataract, the pathology and the causing factors in\ncortical cataract are analyzed. The clouding change in senile cortical cataract\nbegins from the edge of the lens and develops progressively to lens centre. The\npathology of clouding change in cortical cataract is characterized by\ndisruption of some lens fibers, swelling of some other fibers, and deposition\nof water between fibers. Based on the property of a lens fiber, we propose here\na hypothesis on the mechanism of development of senile cortical cataract. I.\nCortical cataract is triggered by disruption of a cortical lens fiber as a\nresult of injury. The disrupted fiber will release water and crystallin\nproteins. II. Neighbor fibers can absorb this water due to high intracellular\nosmotic pressure (IOP) and become swollen. Swelling makes a fiber be stiff and\nhave increased risk to disrupt when it is curved during the accommodation of\nthe lens. These fibers will release water again when they disrupt, and the\nwater will make more local fibers swelling. In this way, the local fibers\nbecome swollen and then disrupt successively. III. The successive swellings and\ndisruptions of local fibers result in enlargement of a clouding change in lens.\nSince the fibers on the outer part of lens cortex have higher risk to be\ninjured than that in the inner part, a clouding change starts from the edge of\nthe lens. In conclusion, the progressive development of senile cortical\ncataract is a result of successive swellings and disruptions of local lens\nfibers, and this is driven by the high IOP in a lens fiber.\n",

Lymphangiogenesis is a\nmarkedly different process from angiogenesis, occurring at different times and\nin response to different chemical stimuli. Two main hypotheses have been\nproposed: 1) lymphatic capillaries sprout from existing interrupted ones at the\nedge of the wound in analogy to the blood angiogenesis case; 2) lymphatic\nendothelial cells first pool in the wound region following the lymph flow and\nthen, once sufficiently populated, start to form a network.

Further, we include the effect of advection due to interstitial\nflow and lymph flow coming from open capillaries.

Prominent vasculature-targeting\ntherapies involve functional tumour-associated blood vessel deterioration and\nnormalisation. The former aims at tumour infarction and nutrient deprivation\nmedi- ated by vascular targeting agents that induce occlusion/collapse of\ntumour blood vessels. In contrast, the therapeutic intention of normalising the\nabnormal structure and function of tumour vascular net- works, e.g. via\nalleviating stress-induced vaso-occlusion, is to improve chemo-, immuno- and\nradiation therapy efficacy. Although both strategies have shown therapeutic\npotential, it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion\ninto the surrounding healthy brain tissue. To shed light on this issue, we\npropose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay\nbetween the mi- gration/proliferation dichotomy (Go-or-Grow) of glioma cells\nand modulations of the functional tumour vasculature. Vaso-modulatory\ninterventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso-occlusion. We\ndiscovered the existence of a critical cell proliferation/diffusion ratio that\nseparates glioma invasion re- sponses to vaso-modulatory interventions into two\ndistinct regimes. While for tumours, belonging to one regime, vascular\nmodulations reduce the tumour front speed and increase the infiltration width,\nfor those in the other regime the invasion speed increases and infiltration\nwidth decreases. We show how these in silico findings can be used to guide\nindividualised approaches of vaso-modulatory treatment strategies and thereby\nimprove success rates.\n",

Asthma\nwas self-reported, while periodontitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque\nindex were determined by clinical examinations. Results: Using logistic\nregression adjusting for gender, smoking status, age, body mass index, family\nhistory of asthma, and income level, revealed that the odds ratio (OR) of\nasthma for a participant with severe periodontitis was 0.44 (95% confidence\ninterval: 0.27, 0.70) that of a participant with none/mild periodontitis . On\nthe other hand, proportion of BOP sites, and plaque index were not\nstatistically significant. For a participant with severe periodontitis, the OR\nof taking asthma medication was 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.43) that\nof a participant with none/mild periodontitis. Moreover, proportion of BOP\nsites was statistically associated to use of asthma medication while plaque\nindex still remained non-significant. Conclusion: Participants with severe\nperiodontitis were less likely to have asthma. Stronger evidence of an inverse\nassociation was found when using asthma medication as outcome.

In this paper, we simulate blood flow and oxygen\ntransfer in feto-placental capillaries by converting three-dimensional\nrepresentations of villous and capillary surfaces, reconstructed from confocal\nlaser scanning microscopy, to finite-element meshes, and calculating values of\nvascular flow resistance and total oxygen transfer. The relationship between\nthe total oxygen transfer rate and the pressure drop through the capillary is\nshown to be captured across a wide range of pressure drops by physical scaling\nlaws and an upper bound on the oxygen transfer rate. A regression equation is\nintroduced that can be used to estimate the oxygen transfer in a capillary\nusing the vascular resistance. Two techniques for quantifying the effects of\nstatistical variability, experimental uncertainty and pathological placental\nstructure on the calculated properties are then introduced. First, scaling\narguments are used to quantify the sensitivity of the model to uncertainties in\nthe geometry and the parameters. Second, the effects of localized dilations in\nfetal capillaries are investigated using an idealized axisymmetric model, to\nquantify the possible effect of pathological placental structure on oxygen\ntransfer. The model predicts how, for a fixed pressure drop through a\ncapillary, oxygen transfer is maximized by an optimal width of the dilation.\nThe results could explain the prevalence of fetal hypoxia in cases of delayed\nvillous maturation, a pathology characterized by a lack of the\nvasculo-syncytial membranes often seen in conjunction with localized capillary\ndilations.\n",

The disease is congenital and children that do not succumb\nto it during the neonatal period will, by age 10 years, more often than not,\nrequire nephrectomy+renal replacement therapy for management of both pain and\nrenal insufficiency. Since increasing cystic index (CI; percent of kidney\noccupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and organ dysfunction,\nmanagement of these patients, including decisions such as elective nephrectomy\nand prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit from\nserial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the\nefficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of\nCI. Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for\ndiagnosis of ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly\nlimited. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more\nreliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat\nimpractical in the pediatric population. Using a well-established mammalian\nmodel of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like analysis of minimally- or\nnon-invasive serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction to derive a\nfamily of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging\nprotocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for\ncalculation of CI. Such a formula will eventually find use in identifying and\nmonitoring patients at high risk for progressing to end-stage renal disease and\naid in the conduct of clinical trials.\n",

Being the direct biochemical precursor of dopamine, L-DOPA is\neffectively converted in the brain, but two major phenomena reduce its\ntherapeutic action: i) competition with amino acids in the gut wall and in the\nblood brain barrier and ii) its fast kinetics (absorption, distribution,\nmetabolism, and elimination). Continuous administration of L-DOPA, such as\njejunal pumps, have addressed the issue of fast absorption. Considering a\nsubcutaneous delivery of L-DOPA allows to bypass the gastrointestinal tract and\navoid competition with dietary amino acids. Remains the competition at the\nblood barrier between amino acids and L-DOPA, which we address by proposing a\nclosed-loop controlled, continuous subcutaneous delivery pump.

        "summary": "  The quarter power allometric scaling of mammalian metabolic rate is largely\nregarded as a universal law of biology. However, it is well known that cell\ncultures do not obey this law. The current thinking is that were in-vitro\ncultures to obey quarter power scaling, they would have more predictive power\nand could for instance provide a viable substitute for animals in research.\nAbout two decades ago, West and coworkers established a model which predicts\nthat metabolic rate follows a quarter power relationship with the mass of an\norganism, based on the premise that tissues are supplied nutrients through a\nfractal distribution network. This paper outlines a theoretical and\ncomputational framework for establishing quarter power scaling in-vitro,\nstarting where fractal distribution ends. Allometric scaling in non-vascular\nspherical tissue constructs was assessed using models of Michaelis Menten\noxygen consumption and diffusion. The results demonstrate that physiological\nscaling is maintained when about 5 to 60% of the construct is exposed to oxygen\nconcentrations less than the Michaelis Menten constant. In these conditions the\nThiele modulus is between 8 and 80, with a significant concentration gradient\nin the sphere. The results have important implications for the design of\ndownscaled in-vitro systems with physiological relevance.\n",

It increases the pressure inside the skull and reduces blood and oxygen\nsupply. To relieve the intracranial pressure, neurosurgeons remove part of the\nskull and allow the swollen brain to bulge outward, a procedure known as\ndecompressive craniectomy. Decompressive craniectomy has been preformed for\nmore than a century; yet, its effects on the swollen brain remain poorly\nunderstood. Here we characterize the deformation, strain, and stretch in\nbulging brains using the nonlinear field theories of mechanics. Our study shows\nthat even small swelling volumes of 28 to 56 ml induce maximum principal\nstrains in excess of 30%. For radially outward-pointing axons, we observe\nmaximal normal stretches of 1.3 deep inside the bulge and maximal tangential\nstretches of 1.3 around the craniectomy edge. While the stretch magnitude\nvaries with opening site and swelling region, our study suggests that the\nlocations of maximum stretch are universally shared amongst all bulging brains.\nOur model can inform neurosurgeons and rationalize the shape and position of\nthe skull opening, with the overall goal to reduce brain damage and improve the\nstructural and functional outcomes of decompressive craniectomy in trauma\npatients.\n",

In our best\nestimate, about 10% of the combined exposures simulated had mild to\ncatastrophic impacts on ovulation.

        "summary": "  Background The morphological and biochemical impact of a short-period of\nstarvation on Japanese quail was investigated. Materials and methods Ten adult\nmale Japanese quail were divided into two groups; control fed and starved. The\ncontrol-fed group was offered food and water ad libitum and the starved group\nwas subjected to a short-period of food deprivation. After 2.5 days, the serum\nwas obtained and different parameters including the total protein, AST, ALT,\ntriglyceride, HDL, LDL, creatinine and urea were assessed. Gastrointestinal\ntract, stomach and liver were excised and their masses were estimated. Paraffin\nand resin embedded sections from the proventriculus, gizzard, liver, duodenum,\nkidney and pancreas were examined with a light microscopy. Results Significant\ndecreases in the masses of body, gastrointestinal tract, stomach and liver of\nthe starved group were recorded. The liver and duodenum were the most affected\norgans. The liver showed depletion of glycogen, vacuolation, hyperemia and\ncellular infiltrations. Duodenal villi showed degenerative changes in lamina\nepithelialis and cellular infiltrations in the lamina propria. Biochemical\nanalysis revealed a decreased level of total protein, AST and ALT, increased\ncholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, and unchanged HDL, urea and creatinine by\nstarvation. Conclusion The current study described in details the effect of\nshort time starvation on quail organs. Time-point adaptive responses of male\nquail to starvation and refeeding on quail organs will be investigated in\nfuture studies.\n",

        "summary": "  Purpose: Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is the most common cause of\nsubarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), which is a life-threatening acute\ncerebrovascular event that typically affects working-age people. This study\naims to investigate the aneurysmal SAH incidence rate in elderly population\nthan in middle aged population in China. Materials and methods: Aneurysmal SAH\ncases were collected retrospectively from the archives of 21 hospitals in\nMainland China. All the cases collected were from September 2016 and backward\nconsecutively for a period of time up to 8 years. SAH was initially diagnosed\nby brain computed tomography, and CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction\nangiography (DSA) was followed and SAH was confirmed to be due to cerebral\naneurysm. When for cases multiple bleeding occurred, the age of the first SAH\nwas used in this study. The toltal incidence from all hospital at each age were\nsummed together for females and males; then adjusted by the total population\nnumber at each age for females and males. The total population data was from\nthe 2010 population census of the People's Republic of China. Results: In total\nthere were 8,144 cases, with 4,861 females and 3,283 males. Our analysis shows\nfor both females and males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate started to decrease\nafter around 65 years old. The males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate might\nhave started to decrease after around 55 years old. Conclusion: In contrast to\nprevious reports, our data demonstrated a decreased aneurysmal subarachnoid\nhemorrhage incidence rate in elderly population than in middle aged population.\nOur data therefore support the hypothesis that aneurysms do not grow\nprogressively once they form but probably either rupture or stabilize and that\nvery elderly patients are at a reduced risk of rupture compared with atients\nwho are younger with the same-sized aneurysms.\n",

Chondrocytes were isolated from the growth cartilage of fetal\nequines, centrifuged and cultured as pellets in either 10% fetal calf serum or\n10% horse serum for 28 days and processed for light and electron microscopy.\nDifferent cell types were counted and expressed as a percentage to the total\ncell number. Growth kinetics including the pellet weight and thickness and the\ncellular density were evaluated. After 7 days in culture, paralysed\nchondrocytes with similar morphology to those described in the rabbit growth\ncartilage could be identified in pellets in each serum type, however, the\nproportion of the cells was different. In pellet cultured with 10% fetal calf\nserum, more than 50% of the cells were paralysed chondrocytes but in 10% horse\nserum, less than 10% of cells were of paralysed type. At day 14, about 50% of\nthe cells in pellets cultured in either serum type differentiated into\nhypertrophic dark chondrocytes and the proportion of paralysed cells was\nmarkedly decreased. After 21 days in each culture, more than 70% of the cells\nwere hypertrophic dark chondrocytes and no paralysed chondrocytes could be\nobserved. The paralysed chondrocytes may be not dying and they likely to be an\nimmature form of hypertrophic dark chondrocytes. It is better to use the term\nimmature dark chondrocytes instead of paralysed cells. This culture system will\nbe useful for further molecular studies on paralysed chondrocytes and to\nexplore the functions of these cells.\n",

Here we propose that this effect may be due to the fact that\nresection of primary tumor results in a decrease in the total systemic amount\nof angiogenesis stimulators, such as VEGF and bFGF. This in turn causes\ndecrease in the systemic level of angiogenesis inhibitors, such as PF-4 and\nTSP-1, which at least temporarily relieves inhibition of secondary tumors,\nallowing them to grow. This construct is predicated on the notion that systemic\nlevel of angiogenesis inhibitors is regulated by the systemic level of\nangiogenesis stimulators, as the host is trying to maintain the homeostatic\nbalance of stimulators to inhibitors in the body. We evaluate this hypothesis\nusing a conceptual mathematical model and show that indeed, this mechanism can\nexplain accelerated growth of secondary tumors following resection of a primary\ntumor. We also show that there exists a tradeoff between time of surgery and\ntime to onset of metastatic growth. We conclude with a discussion of possible\ntherapeutic approaches that may counteract this effect and reduce metastatic\nrecurrences after surgery.\n",

The results of our numerical study show that spatiotemporally\nchaotic dynamics in this regime can be described as a dynamical equilibrium\nbetween topologically distinct types of transitions that increase or decrease\nthe number of wavelets, in general agreement with the multiple wavelets\nhypothesis. Surprisingly, we found that the process of continuous excitation\nwaves breaking up into discontinuous pieces plays no role whatsoever in\nmaintaining spatiotemporal complexity. Instead this complexity is maintained as\na dynamical balance between wave coalescence -- a unique, previously\nunidentified, topological process that increases the number of wavelets -- and\nwave collapse -- a different topological process that decreases their number.\n",

The cellular\nmicroenvironment triggers the switch between both modes, thereby allowing\nadaptation to dynamic conditions. It is, however, unclear if this\namoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity contributes to a more effective tumor\ninvasion. We address this question with a mathematical model, where the\namoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity is regulated in response to local\nextracellular matrix resistance. Our numerical analysis reveals that\nextracellular matrix structure and presence of a chemotactic gradient are key\ndeterminants of the model behavior. Only in complex microenvironments, if the\nextracellular matrix is highly heterogeneous and a chemotactic gradient directs\nmigration, the amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity allows a more\nwidespread invasion compared to the non-switching amoeboid and mesenchymal\nmodes. Importantly, these specific conditions are characteristic for in vivo\ntumor invasion. Thus, our study suggests that \\emph{in vitro} systems aiming at\nunraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumor invasion should take\ninto account the complexity of the microenvironment by considering the combined\neffects of structural heterogeneities and chemical gradients on cell migration.\n",

Numerical simulations of such wear has seen\nincreasing attention over the last years. They have the potential to be much\nfaster and less expensive than the in vitro tests in use today. While it is\nunlikely that in silico tests will replace actual physical tests in the\nforeseeable future, a judicious combination of both approaches can help making\nboth implant design and pre-clinical testing quicker and more cost-effective.\n  The challenge today for the design of simulation methods is to obtain results\nthat convey quantitative information, and to do so quickly and reliably. This\ninvolves the choice of mathematical models as well as the numerical tools used\nto solve them. The correctness of the choice can only be validated by comparing\nwith experimental results.\n  In this paper we present finite element simulations of the wear in TKRs\nduring the gait cycle standardized in the ISO 14243-1 document, used for\ncompliance testing in several countries. As the ISO 14243-1 standard is\nprecisely defined and publicly available, it can serve as an excellent\nbenchmark for comparison of wear simulation methods. Our novel contact\nalgorithm works without Lagrange multipliers and penalty methods, achieving\nunparalleled stability and efficiency. We compare our simulation results with\nthe experimental data from physical tests using two different actual TKRs, each\ntest being performed three times. We can closely predict the total mass loss\ndue to wear after five million gait cycles. We also observe a good match\nbetween the wear patterns seen in experiments and our simulation results.\n",

Model features are compared in terms of action potential morphology,\nrestitution curves, frequency spectra and spatio-temporal phase differences.\nTwo-dimensional long-run simulations are finally performed to characterize\nspiral breakup during sustained fibrillation at different thermal states.\nTemperature and nonlinear diffusion effects are found to impact the\nrepolarization phase of the action potential wave with non-monotone patterns\nand to increase the propensity of arrhythmogenesis.\n",

Whereas, these\nconjectures were based on indirect measures of loading mechanisms, in this work\nwe take advantage of advances in bioimaging to directly assess collagen fibers\nand wall architecture during loading. A custom biaxial mechanical testing\nsystem compatible with multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was used to directly\nmeasure the layer dependent collagen fiber recruitment in bladder tissue from 9\nmale Fischer rats (4 adult and 5 aged). As for other soft tissues, the bladder\nloading curve was exponential in shape and could be divided into toe,\ntransition and high stress regimes. The relationship between collagen\nrecruitment and loading curves were evaluated in the context of the inner\nbladder wall (lamina propria) and outer detrusor smooth muscle layer. The large\nextensibility of the bladder was found to be possible due to folds in the wall\n(rugae) that provide a mechanism for low resistance flattening without any\ndiscernible recruitment of collagen fibers throughout the toe regime. For\nelastic bladders, as the loading extended into the transition regime, a gradual\ncoordinated recruitment of collagen fibers between the lamina propria and\ndetrusor smooth muscle layers was found. A second important finding is that\nwall extensibility could be lost by premature recruitment of collagen in the\nouter wall that cut short the toe region. This work provides, for the first\ntime, a mechanistic understanding of the role of collagen recruitment in\ndetermining bladder capacitance.\n",

Presently, its\nprecise, direct quantitative assessment can only be done on whole tissue\nsections immunostained to reveal vascular endothelial cells. But this is a\ntremendous task for the pathologist and a challenge for the computer since\ndigitised whole tissue sections, whole slide images (WSI), contain typically\naround ten gigapixels.\n  We define and implement an algorithm that determines automatically, on a WSI\nat objective magnification $40\\times$, the regions of tissue, the regions\nwithout blur and the regions of large puddles of red blood cells, and\nconstructs the mask of blur-free, significant tissue on the WSI. Then it\ncalibrates automatically the optical density ratios of the immunostaining of\nthe vessel walls and of the counterstaining, performs a colour deconvolution\ninside the regions of blur-free tissue, and finds the vessel walls inside these\nregions by selecting, on the image resulting from the colour deconvolution,\nzones which satisfy a double-threshold criterion. A mask of vessel wall regions\non the WSI is produced. The density of microvessels is finally computed as the\nfraction of the area of significant tissue which is occupied by vessel walls.\n  We apply this algorithm to a set of 186 WSI of paediatric brain tumours from\nWorld Health Organisation grades I to IV.

This feature, common to many gyrencephalic\nspecies including humans, has attracted recent attention from soft matter\nphysicists. It occurs due to inhomogeneous, and predominantly tangential,\ngrowth of the cortex, which causes circumferential compression, leading to a\nbifurcation of the solution path to a folded configuration. The problem can be\nframed as one of buckling in the regime of linearized elasticity. However, the\nbrain is a very soft solid, which is subject to large strains due to\ninhomogeneous growth. As a consequence, the morphomechanics of the developing\nbrain demonstrates an extensive post-bifurcation regime. Nonlinear elasticity\nstudies of growth-driven brain folding have established the conditions\nnecessary for the onset of folding, and for its progression to configurations\nbroadly resembling gyrencephalic brains. The reference, unfolded,\nconfigurations in these treatments have a high degree of symmetry--typically,\nellipsoidal. Depending on the boundary conditions, the folded configurations\nhave symmetric or anti-symmetric patterns. However, these configurations do not\napproximate the actual morphology of, e.g., human brains, which display\nunsymmetric folding. More importantly, from a neurodevelopmental standpoint,\nmany of the unsymmetric sulci and gyri are notably robust in their locations.\nHere, we initiate studies on the physical mechanisms and geometry that control\nthe development of primary sulci and gyri. In this preliminary communication we\ncarry out computations with idealized geometries, boundary conditions and\nparameters, seeking a pattern resembling one of the first folds to form: the\nCentral Sulcus.\n",

Disadvantages, such as low accessibility, high\ncosts, and imprecision of clinical tests and ultrasonography measurements, may\ncompromise health decisions at birth, based on the gestational age. Newborns\norgans and tissues can indirectly indicate their physical maturity, and we\nhypothesized that evolutionary changes in their skin, detected using an\noptoelectronic device meter, may aid in estimating the gestational age. This\nstudy analyzed the feasibility of using newborn skin reflectance to estimate\nthe gestational age at birth noninvasively. A cross-sectional study evaluated\nthe skin reflectance of selected infants, preferably premature, at birth. The\nfirst-trimester ultrasound was the reference for gestational age. A prototype\nof a new noninvasive optoelectronic device measured the backscattering of light\nfrom the skin, using a light emitting diode at wavelengths of 470 nm, 575 nm,\nand 630 nm. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis models were\nemployed to predict gestational age, combining skin reflectance with clinical\nvariables for gestational age estimation. The gestational age at birth of 115\nnewborns from 24.1 to 41.8 weeks of gestation correlated with the light at 630\nnm wavelength reflectance 3.3 mm/6.5 mm ratio distant of the sensor, at the\nforearm and sole .

The diffusion factors (one\ninhibitor and one activator) acting on cell surface receptors modulate the\nactivity of a transcription factor. The difference in the local concentration\nof diffusion factors is translated into the degree of activation of\ntranscription factors. The speed of this process determines then pattern\nformation velocity, i.e. the elapsed time from an initial noisy situation to a\nfinal developed pattern. If the pattern formation velocity slows down compared\nto the growth of the surface, the phenomenon of \"growing surface interference\"\noccurs. We find that this phenomenon might explain the rosette pattern observed\non different types of felids and the pale stripes found between the regular\nblack stripes of zebras.

Little is known about the\nhistology of the liver of reptiles. The aim of the current study was to\nelucidate the histological architecture of the liver of the Nile monitor\n(Varanus niloticus). Liver fragments from the Nile monitor were collected in\nthe summer season and processed for the light and electron microscopy. The\nliver of the Nile monitor was bi-lobed and the right lobe was found to be\nlarger than the left lobe. Histological examination revealed indistinct\nlobulation of the liver, and the central vein, sinusoids and portal area were\nhaphazardly organized. The hepatic parenchyma consisted of hepatocytes arranged\nin glandular-like alveoli or tubules separated by a network of twisted\ncapillary sinusoids. The hepatocytes were polyhedral in shape with vacuolated\ncytoplasm and the nucleus was single rounded, eccentric, large and vesicular\nwith a distinct nucleolus. The hepatocytes contained numerous lipid droplets,\nabundant glycogen granules and well-developed RER and mitochondria. The\nhepatocytes appeared to secrete into the bile canaliculi through the\ndisintegration of their dark cytoplasm into the bile canaliculi. The space of\nDisse separating between the hepatocytes and sinusoids contained many recesses.\nThe portal area contained branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile\nduct and lymphatic vessels embedded in a connective tissue. Some\nnon-parenchymal cells were described such as Kupffer cells, heterophils,\nmelano-macrophages, intercalated cells, myofibroblasts in addition to the\nendothelium of the sinusoids. This is the first report about the histological\nstructure of the liver of the Egyptian Nile monitor. The result presented here\nshould be considered a baseline knowledge to compare with the pathological\naffections of the liver in this species.\n",

This\nsuggestion has become a part of the accepted paradigm on soil toxicity.\nConsequently, stringent fertilizer control programs to monitor Cd have been\nlaunched. Attempts to link Cd toxicity and fertilizers to chronic diseases are\ncommon. A re-assessment of this \"accepted\" paradigm is timely, given the larger\nbody of data available today. The data show that both the input and output of\nCd per hectare from fertilizers are negligibly small compared to the total\namount of Cd/hectare usually present in the soil itself. Calculations based on\ncurrent agricultural practices are used to show that it will take about 18\ncenturies to double the ambient soil-cadmium level, and about 8 centuries to\ndouble the soil-fluoride level, even after neglecting leaching and other\nremoval effects. Hence the concern of long-term agriculture should be the\ndepletion of available phosphate fertilizers, rather than the contamination of\nthe soil by trace metals or fluoride. This conclusion is confirmed by showing\nthat the claimed correlations between fertilizer input and cadmium accumulation\nin crops are not robust. Alternative scenarios that explain the data are\nexamined. Thus soil acidulation on fertilizer loading, and the effect of\nmagnesium, zinc, and fluoride ions contained in fertilizers are considered\nusing recent Cd$^{2+}$, Mg$^{2+}$ and F$^-$ ion-association theories. The\nprotective role of ions like Zn, Se, Fe, etc., is emphasized, and the question\nof cadmium toxicity in the presence of other ions is considered. These help to\nclarify and rectify difficulties found in the standard point of view. This\nanalysis does not modify the accepted views on Cd contamination by airborne\ndelivery, smoking, and industrial activity, or P-contamination causing algal\nblooms.\n",

Here we aim to examine the\nexpression profiles of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and of\ntransient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)\nand extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and to assess the possible\ntherapeutic strategies through blockade of transient receptor potential (TRP)\nchannels. Methods: Cancer was induced within the sciatic nerves of male\nCopenhagen rats, and tissues from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were collected and\nused for measurements of immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The TRPV1\nantagonist capsazepine, the selective TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 and the\ncalcium ions inhibitor ruthenium red were used to treat thermal and/or\nmechanical hyperalgesia. Results: Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1\nshowed a lower expression in DRGs on days 7 and 14. The expression of TRPV4,\nTLR4 and ERK1/2 showed an increase on day 3 then a decrease on days 7 and 14.\nTRPV1 and TLR4 as well as TRPV4 and ERK1/2 co-existed on the same neuronal\ncells. The neuropathic pain was reversed in dose-dependent manners by using the\nTRP antagonists and the calcium ions inhibitor. Conclusion: The decreased\nexpression of TRPV1 and TRPV4 is associated with high activation. The increased\nexpression of TLR4 and ERK1/2 reveals earlier immune response and tumor\nprogression, respectively, and their ultimate decrease is an indicator of nerve\ndamage. We studied the possible role of TRPV1 and TRPV4 in transducing\ncancer-induced hyperalgesia. The possible treatment strategies of\ncancer-induced thermal and/or mechanical hyperalgesia using capsazepine,\nHC-067047 and ruthenium red are examined.\n",

To address the continued challenge of studying treatments\nin this fragile population, we developed a nonlinear lumped-parameter model of\nrespiratory system mechanics of the extremely preterm infant that incorporates\nnonlinear lung and chest wall compliances and lung volume parameters tuned to\nthis population. In particular we developed a novel empirical representation of\nprogressive volume loss based on compensatory alveolar pressure increase\nresulting from collapsed alveoli. The model demonstrates increased rate of\nvolume loss related to high chest wall compliance, and simulates laryngeal\nbraking for elevation of end-expiratory lung volume and constant positive\nairway pressure (CPAP). The model predicts that low chest wall compliance\n(chest stiffening) in addition to laryngeal braking and CPAP enhance breathing\nand delay lung volume loss.

The rate of these\ncancers in female rats is about one third the rate in male rats; the rate of\ngliomas in female humans is about two thirds the rate in male humans. Both of\nthese observations can be explained by a decrease in sensitivity to chemical\ncarcinogenesis in both female rats and female humans.

Exactly how auxin transport and\ndevelopmental processes such as growth coordinate to achieve the precise\npatterns of auxin observed experimentally is not well understood. Here we use\nmathematical modelling to examine the interplay between auxin dynamics and\ngrowth and their contribution to formation of patterns in auxin distribution in\nplant tissues. Mathematical models describing the auxin-related signalling\npathway, PIN and AUX1 dynamics, auxin transport, and cell growth in plant\ntissues are derived. A key assumption of our models is the regulation of PIN\nproteins by the auxin-responsive ARF-Aux/IAA signalling pathway, with\nupregulation of PIN biosynthesis by ARFs. Models are analysed and solved\nnumerically to examine the long-time behaviour and auxin distribution. Changes\nin auxin-related signalling processes are shown to be able to trigger\ntransition between passage and spot type patterns in auxin distribution. The\nmodel was also shown to be able to generate isolated cells with oscillatory\ndynamics in levels of components of the auxin signalling pathway which could\nexplain oscillations in levels of ARF targets that have been observed\nexperimentally. Cell growth was shown to have influence on PIN polarisation and\ndetermination of auxin distribution patterns. Numerical simulation results\nindicate that auxin-related signalling processes can explain the different\npatterns in auxin distributions observed in plant tissues, whereas the\ninterplay between auxin transport and growth can explain the `reverse-fountain'\npattern in auxin distribution observed at plant root tips.\n",

Under the rubric of MCDP, the tumor foci to be detected are\nregarded as solutions of the objective function, the tissue region around the\ncancer areas represents the parameter space, and the nanorobots loaded with\ncontrast medium molecules for cancer detection correspond to the optimization\nagents. The process that the nanorobots detect tumors by swimming in the\nhigh-risk tissue region can be regarded as the process that the agents search\nfor the solutions of an objective function in the parameter space with some\nconstraints. For multimodal optimization (MMO) aiming to locate multiple\noptimal solutions in a single simulation run, niche technology has been widely\nused. Specifically, the Niche Genetic Algorithm (NGA) has been shown to be\nparticularly effective in solving MMO. It can be used to identify the global\noptima of multiple hump functions in a running, keep effectively the diversity\nof the population, and avoid premature of the genetic algorithm. Learning from\nthe optimization procedure of NGA, we propose the NGA-inspired MCDP in order to\nlocate the tumor targets efficiently while taking into account realistic in\nvivo propagation and controlling of nanorobots, which is different from the use\nscenario of the standard NGA. To improve the performance of the MCDP, we also\nmodify the crossover operator of the original NGA from crossing within a\npopulation to crossing between two populations. Finally, we present\ncomprehensive numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nNGA-inspired MCDP when the biological objective function is associated with the\nblood flow velocity profile caused by tumor-induced angiogenesis.\n",

A blood pump surgically placed in the cavopulmonary\npathway can substitute the function of the absent sub-pulmonary ventricle by\ngenerating a mild pressure boost. However, there is currently no commercially\navailable device designed for the cavopulmonary application; and the risks and\nbenefits of implanting a ventricular assist device (VAD) originally designed\nfor the left ventricular application on the right circulation of failing Fontan\npatients is not yet clear. Moreover, further research is needed to compare the\nhemodynamics between the two clinically-considered surgical configurations\n(Full Support and IVC Support) for cavopulmonary assist, with Full and IVC\nSupport corresponding to the entire venous return or only the inferior venous\nreturn, respectively, being routed through the VAD.

We\nobserved that during the Full support the VAD improved the cardiac output while\nmaintaining blood pressures within safe ranges, and lowered the IVC pressure to\n<15mmHg; however, we found a potential risk of lung damage at higher pump\nspeeds due to the excessive pulmonary pressure elevation.

Much of RA treatment is focused on\nsuppressing inflammation, with the idea being that if inflammation is\ncontrolled other symptoms, such as pain, will disappear. However, pain is the\nmost common complaint of RA patients, is often still present following the\nresolution of inflammation, and can develop prior to the onset of inflammation.\nThus, further research is needed to better understand RA-associated pain\nmechanisms. A number of preclinical rodent models commonly used in rheumatology\nresearch have been developed based on bedside-to-bench and reverse\ntranslational approaches. These models include collagen-induced arthritis,\nantigen-induced arthritis, streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis, collagen\nantibody-induced arthritis, serum transfer from K/BxN transgenic mice and tumor\nnecrosis factor (TNF)-transgene mice. They have led to increased understanding\nof RA pathogenesis and have aided the development of successful RA treatments.\nMore recently, these models have been used to elucidate the complexities of RA\nassociated pain. Several potentially modifiable mechanisms, other than\ninflammation, have been investigated in these models and may in turn lead to\nmore effective treatments. Furthermore, preclinical research can indicate when\nspecific treatment strategies may benefit specific patient subgroups or at\nwhich disease stage they are best used. This review not only highlights\nRA-associated pain mechanisms, but also suggests the usefulness of preclinical\nanimal research based on a bedside-to-bench approach.\n",

The key contributions of this work are: (1)\nDetermination of the patient condition, contingent upon the patient specific\nmodel parameters, which leads to prediction of the appropriate patient specific\ntherapeutic dosage. (2) Addressing the question of how the dual therapy of TKI\nand Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin signaling or triple combination of all three, offers\npotentially improved therapeutic responses, particularly in terms of reduced\nside effects of TKI or IFN-$\\alpha$. (3) Prediction of the likelihood of CML\nextinction/remission based on the level of CML stem cells at detection.\n",

The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue\nwas identified using non-invasive methods such as surface electromyography,\nnear-infrared spectroscopy, magnetic nerve stimulation and twitch interpolation\ntechnique.Results The number of repetitions was significantly lower in men at\nOPT (14.8$\\pm$3.2) and LONG (15.8$\\pm$5.8) than boys (39.7$\\pm$18.4 and 29.5\n$\\pm$10.2, respectively; p<0.001), while no difference was found at SHORT\nbetween both age groups (boys: 33.7$\\pm$15.4, men: 40.9$\\pm$14.2). At OPT and\nLONG boys showed a lower reduction in the single potentiated twitch (Qtwpot)\nand a greater decrease in the voluntary activation level (VA) than men. At\nSHORT, both populations displayed a moderate Qtwpot decrement and a significant\nVA reduction (p<0.001). The differences in maximal torque between boys and men\nwere almost twice greater at OPT (223.9 N.m) than at SHORT (123.3 N.m) and LONG\n(136.5 N.m).Conclusion The differences in neuromuscular fatigue between\nchildren and adults are dependent on MTU length. Differences in maximal torque\ncould underpin differences in neuromuscular fatigue between children and adults\nat OPT and SHORT. However, at LONG these differences do not seem to be\nexplained by differences in maximal torque. The origins of this specific effect\nof MTU length remain to be determined.\n",

        "summary": "  Current scientific consensus holds that sound is transmitted, solely\nmechanically, from the tympanum to the cochlea via ossicles. But this theory\ndoes not explain the hearing extreme quality regarding high frequencies in\nmammals. So, we propose a bioelectronic pathway (the covert path) that is\ncomplementary to the overt path.. We demonstrate experimentally that the\ntympanum produces piezoelectric potentials isochronous to acoustic vibrations\nthanks to its collagen fibers and that their amplitude increases along with the\nfrequency and level of the vibrations. This finding supports the existence of\nan electrical pathway, specialized in transmitting high-frequency sounds, that\nworks in unison with the mechanical pathway. A bio-organic triode, similar to a\nfield effect transistor, is the key mechanism of our hypothesized pathway. We\npresent evidence that any deficiency along this pathway produces hearing\nimpairment. By augmenting the classical theory of sound transmission, our\ndiscovery offers new perspectives for research into both normal and\npathological audition and may contribute to an understanding of genetic and\nphysiological problems of hearing.\n",

        "summary": "  The spontaneous emergence of contraction-inducing electrical activity in the\nuterus at the beginning of labor remains poorly understood, partly due to the\nseemingly contradictory observation that isolated uterine cells are not\nspontaneously active. It is known, however, that the expression of gap\njunctions increases dramatically in the approach to parturition, which results\nin a significant increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling. In this paper,\nwe build upon previous studies of the activity of electrically excitable smooth\nmuscle cells (myocytes) and investigate the mechanism through which the\ncoupling of these cells to electrically passive cells results in the generation\nof spontaneous activity in the uterus. Using a recently developed, realistic\nmodel of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a\nmyocyte coupled to passive cells. We then extend our analysis to a simple\ntwo-dimensional lattice model of the tissue, with each myocyte being coupled to\nits neighbors, as well as to a random number of passive cells. We observe that\ndifferent dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction\nconductances: at low coupling strength, the activity is confined to cell\nclusters, while the activity for high coupling may spread across the entire\ntissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous\ngeneration of spiral wave activity. Our results are both qualitatively and\nquantitatively consistent with observations from in vitro experiments. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that an increase in inter-cellular electrical\ncoupling, for realistic parameter values, strongly facilitates the appearance\nof spontaneous action potentials that may eventually lead to parturition.\n",

Paraffin sections were stained with\nhematoxylin and eosin or Von Kossa and then examined using light microscopy.\nResults: The current study showed different histological structures of compact\nbones from studied species and an absence of the typical Haversian system seen\nin mammals. The compact bone of geckos was mostly avascular, while Nile monitor\nbone was highly vascular. Sparrow bone showed one side vascular and the other\nside avascular. The vascularity was represented by primary vascular canals\nsurrounded by a few irregularly arranged osteocytes inside their lacunae\nforming primary osteons. Bone tissue from ducks and geese were similar and were\ncomposed mostly of dense Haversian tissue, while some areas had primary\nosteons.

        "summary": "  An electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived heart rate variability (HRV) index\nreliably tracks the inflammatory response induced by low-dose\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) in near-term sheep fetuses. We evaluated the effect of\nvagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on vagus nerve electroneurogram (VENG) and the\nsystemic inflammatory response induced by a high dose of LPS in neonatal\npiglets to mimic late-onset neonatal sepsis. We tested if our HRV inflammatory\nindex tracks inflammation in piglets and its relationship to VENG. Following\nanesthesia, electrodes were attached to the left vagal nerve; ECG and blood\npressure (BP) were recorded throughout the experiment. Following baseline, the\npiglets were administered LPS as 2mg/kg IV bolus. In the VNS treated piglet,\nthe vagus nerve was stimulated for 10 minutes prior to and 10 min after the\ninjection of LPS. In both groups, every 15 min post LPS, the arterial blood\nsample was drawn for blood gas, metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines. At the\nend of the experiment, the piglets were euthanized. BP and HRV measures were\ncalculated. The piglets developed a potent inflammatory response to the LPS\ninjection with TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 peaking between 45 and 90 min\npost-injection. VNS diminished the LPS-induced systemic inflammatory response\nvarying across the measured cytokines from two to ten-fold. The HRV index\ntracked accurately the temporal profile of cytokines and VENG changes. This\nnovel model allows manipulating and tracking neonatal sepsis: The HRV\ninflammatory index 1) applies across species pre- and postnatally and 2)\nperforms well at different degrees of sepsis (i.e., nanogram and milligram\ndoses of LPS); 3) the present VNS paradigm effectively suppresses LPS-induced\ninflammation, even at high doses of LPS. The potential of early postnatal VNS\nto counteract sepsis and of HRV monitoring to early detect and track it deserve\nfurther study.\n",

To investigate\nthe role of mechanics and geometry in the morpholgical dynamics of melanocytic\nnevi, we study a computation model for cell proliferation in a layered\nnon-linear elastic tissue. Numerical simulations suggest that the morphology of\nthe nevus is correlated to the initial location of the proliferating cell\nstarting the growth process and to the mechanical properties of the tissue. Our\nresults also support that melanocytes are subject to compressive stresses that\nfluctuate widely in the nevus and depend on the growth stage. Numerical\nsimulations of cells in the epidermis releasing matrix metalloproteinases\ndisplay an accelerated invasion of the dermis by destroying the basal membrane.\nMoreover, we suggest experimentally that osmotic stress and collagen inhibit\ngrowth in primary melanoma cells while the effect is much weaker in metastatic\ncells.

They originate\nfrom intestinal crypts, glands that descend from the intestinal lumen into the\nunderlying connective tissue. Normal crypts are thought to exist in a dynamic\nequilibrium where the rate of cell production at the base of a crypt is matched\nby that of loss at the top. Understanding how genetic alterations accumulate\nand proceed to disrupt this dynamic equilibrium is fundamental to understanding\nthe origins of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer emerges from the\ninteraction of biological processes that span several spatial scales, from\nmutations that cause inappropriate intracellular responses to changes at the\ncell/tissue level, such as uncontrolled proliferation and altered motility and\nadhesion. Multiscale mathematical modelling can provide insight into the\nspatiotemporal organisation of such a complex, highly regulated and dynamic\nsystem. Moreover, the aforementioned challenges are inherent to the multiscale\nmodelling of biological tissue more generally. In this review we describe the\nmathematical approaches that have been applied to investigate multiscale\naspects of crypt behaviour, highlighting a number of model predictions that\nhave since been validated experimentally. We also discuss some of the key\nmathematical and computational challenges associated with the multiscale\nmodelling approach. We conclude by discussing recent efforts to derive\ncoarse-grained descriptions of such models, which may offer one way of reducing\nthe computational cost of simulation by leveraging well-established tools of\nmathematical analysis to address key problems in multiscale modelling.\n",

For example cell communication via a diffusible factor\nallows for information to travel across large distances within the population,\nand cell polarisation makes it possible to form structures with a particular\norientation, but how do these processes interact to produce a more robust and\nregulated structure? In this study we investigate the ability of cells with\ndifferent cellular characteristics to grow and maintain homeostatic structures.\nWe do this in the context of an individual-based model where cell behaviour is\ndriven by an intra-cellular network that determines the cell phenotype. More\nprecisely, we investigated evolution with 96 different permutations of our\nmodel, where cell motility, cell death, long-range growth factor (LGF),\nshort-range growth factor (SGF) and cell polarisation were either present or\nabsent. The results show that LGF has the largest positive impact on the\nfitness of the evolved solutions. SGF and polarisation also contribute, but all\nother capabilities essentially increase the search space, effectively making it\nmore difficult to achieve a solution. By perturbing the evolved solutions, we\nfound that they are highly robust to both mutations and wounding. In addition,\nwe observed that by evolving solutions in more unstable environments they\nproduce structures that were more robust and adaptive. In conclusion, our\nresults suggest that robust collective behaviour is most likely to evolve when\ncells are endowed with long range communication, cell polarisation, and\nselection pressure from an unstable environment.\n",

As\nthree-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs become larger, more intricate, and\nmore clinically applicable, it will be essential to understand internal\ndynamics and signaling molecule concentrations throughout the tissue. Diffusion\ncharacteristics present a significant limitation in many engineered tissues,\nparticularly for avascular tissues and for cells whose viability,\ndifferentiation, or function are affected by concentrations of oxygen and\nnutrients. This paper seeks to provide novel analytic solutions for certain\ncases of steady-state and non-steady-state diffusion and metabolism in 3D\nconstruct designs (planar, cylindrical, and spherical forms), solutions that\notherwise require mathematical approximations achieved through numerical\nmethods. This model is applied to cerebral organoids, where it is shown that\nlimitations in diffusion and organoid size can be partially overcome by\nlocalizing metabolically-active cells to an outer layer in a sphere, a\nregionalization process that is known to occur through neuroglial precursor\nmigration both in organoids and in early brain development. The given\nprototypical solutions include a review of metabolic information for many cell\ntypes and can be broadly applied to many forms of tissue constructs. This work\nenables researchers to model oxygen and nutrient delivery to cells, predict\ncell viability, design constructs with improved diffusion capabilities, and\naccurately control molecular concentrations in tissue constructs that may be\nused in studying models of development and disease or for conditioning cells to\nenhance survival after insults like ischemia or implantation into the body,\nthereby providing a framework for better understanding and exploring the\ncharacteristics of engineered tissue constructs.\n",

The\nmulticellular system comprises three main cell types; $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$\ncells reciprocally decrease and increase blood glucose by producing insulin and\nglucagon pulses, while the role of $\\delta$ cells is less clear. Although their\nspatial organization and the paracrine/autocrine interactions between them have\nbeen extensively studied, the functional implications of the design principles\nare still lacking. In this study, we formulated a mathematical model that\nintegrates the pulsatility of hormone secretion and the interactions and\norganization of islet cells and examined the effects of different cellular\ncompositions and organizations in mouse and human islets. A common feature of\nboth species was that islet cells produced synchronous hormone pulses under\nlow- and high- glucose conditions, while they produced asynchronous hormone\npulses under normal glucose conditions. However, the synchronous coordination\nof insulin and glucagon pulses at low glucose was more pronounced in human\nislets that had more $\\alpha$ cells. When $\\beta$ cells were selectively\nremoved to mimic diabetic conditions, the anti-synchronicity of insulin and\nglucagon pulses was deteriorated at high glucose, but it could be partially\nrecovered when the re-aggregation of remaining cells was considered. Finally,\nthe third cell type, $\\delta$ cells, which introduced additional complexity in\nthe multicellular system, prevented the excessive synchronization of hormone\npulses.

Typical models of cell\ngrowth for tissue engineering applications make use of spatially homogeneous or\nspatially continuous equations to model cell growth, flow of culture medium,\nnutrient transport, and their interactions. The network structure of the\nphysical porous scaffold is often incorporated through parameters in these\nmodels, either phenomenologically or through techniques like mathematical\nhomogenization. We derive a model on a square grid lattice to demonstrate the\nimportance of explicitly modelling the network structure of the porous\nscaffold, and compare results from this model with those from a modified\ncontinuum model from the literature. We capture two-way coupling between cell\ngrowth and fluid flow by allowing cells to block pores, and by allowing the\nshear stress of the fluid to affect cell growth and death. We explore a range\nof parameters for both models, and demonstrate quantitative and qualitative\ndifferences between predictions from each of these approaches, including\nspatial pattern formation and local oscillations in cell density present only\nin the lattice model. These differences suggest that for some parameter\nregimes, corresponding to specific cell types and scaffold geometries, the\nlattice model gives qualitatively different model predictions than typical\ncontinuum models.

Given the sheer size of the non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD) epidemic, and the dismal prognosis associated with late-stage\nprimary liver cancer, there is an urgent need for HCC surveillance in the NASH\npatient. In the present study, adult male mice randomized to control diet or a\nfast food diet (FFD) were followed for up to 14 mo and serum level of a panel\nof HCC-relevant biomarkers was compared with liver biopsies at 3 and 14 mo.\nBoth NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) and hepatic hydroxyproline content were\nelevated at 3 and 14 mo on FFD. Picrosirius red staining of liver sections\nrevealed a filigree pattern of fibrillar collagen deposition with no cirrhosis\nat 14 mo on FFD.

        "summary": "  Though considered as an inflammation marker, exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) was\nshown to be sensitive to airway caliber changes to such an extent that it might\nbe considered as a marker of them. It is thus important to understand how these\nchanges and their localization mechanically affect the total NO flux\npenetrating the airway lumen (JawNO), hence FENO, independently from any\ninflammatory status change. A new model was used which simulates NO production,\nconsumption and diffusion inside the airway epithelium wall, then, NO excretion\nthrough the epithelial wall into the airway lumen and, finally, its axial\ntransport by diffusion and convection in the airway lumen. This model may also\nconsider the presence of a mucus layer coating the epithelial wall. Simulations\nwere performed that showed the great sensitivity of JawNO to peripheral airways\ncaliber changes. Moreover, FENO showed distinct behaviors depending on the\nlocation of the caliber change. Considering a bronchodilation, absence of FENO\nchange was associated with dilation of central airways, FENO increase with\ndilation up to pre-acinar small airways, and FENO decrease with intra-acinar\ndilation due to amplification of the back-diffusion flux. The presence of a\nmucus layer was also shown to play a significant role in FENO changes.\nAltogether, the present work provides theoretical evidences that specific FENO\nchanges in acute situations are linked to specifically located airway caliber\nchanges in the lung periphery. This opens the way for a new role for FENO as a\nfunctional marker of peripheral airway caliber change.\n",

The distribution of the\nwhite and colored zones does not follow the classical Turing patterns. Here we\npresent a modeling framework for pattern formation that enables to easily\nmodify the relationship between three factors with different feedback\nmechanisms. These factors consist of two diffusing factors and a\ncell-autonomous immobile transcription factor. Globally the model allowed to\ndistinguishing four different situations. Two situations result in the\nproduction of classical Turing patterns; regularly spaced spots and labyrinth\npatterns. Moreover, an initial slope in the activation of the transcription\nfactor produces straight lines. The third situation does not lead to patterns,\nbut results in different homogeneous color tones. Finally, the fourth one sheds\nnew light on the possible mechanisms leading to the formation of piebald\npatterns exemplified by the random patterns on the fur of some cow strains and\nDalmatian dogs. We demonstrate that these piebald patterns are of transient\nnature, develop from random initial conditions and rely on a system's\nbi-stability. The main novelty lies in our finding that the presence of a\ncell-autonomous factor not only expands the range of reaction diffusion\nparameters in which a pattern may arise, but also extends the pattern-forming\nabilities of the reaction-diffusion equations.\n",

Pathologists are able to identify rosettes [full\ncircles] and the presence of partial rosettes [semi-circles] and interpret this\nas a sign of differentiation in a tumor. However, there is no objective method\nto quantitate the many partial rosettes that are obvious or not obvious to the\nnaked eye. This paper proposes a mathematical algorithm to computationally\ndetect the presence of obvious or non-obvious partial rosettes, henceforth\nreferred to as Nguyen-Wu Partial Rosettes. Quantifying the degree of partial\nrosettes present in a tumor may allow pathologists to stratify tumors into more\nrefined groups that may respond better to therapy or have different clinical\noutcomes. The Midline Cross Product [MCP] algorithm calculates the magnitude of\ntwo cross products and adds them together to obtain one value. Each of the two\ncross products results from [1] the line that connects the midpoints of longest\nlengths of two neighboring ovals, and [2] the line that extends from the\nmidpoint from one longest length and is perpendicular to that longest length.\nThe MCP algorithm makes nuclei that are arranged in consecutive rows and arches\nquantitatively distinct from nuclei that are arranged next to each other in a\ndisorderly manner.\n",

Using a simple\ncellular automata model of atrial fibrillation, we demonstrate a method by\nwhich re-entrant drivers can be located quickly and accurately using a\ncollection of indirect electrogram measurements. The method proposed employs\nsimple, out of the box machine learning algorithms to correlate characteristic\nelectrogram gradients with the displacement of an electrogram recording from a\nre-entrant driver. Such a method is less sensitive to local fluctuations in\nelectrical activity.

We present a\nmathematical model to study the influence of hypoxia and acidity on the\nevolutionary dynamics of cancer cells in vascularised tumours.

The results of numerical\nsimulations of a calibrated version of the model based on real data\nrecapitulate the eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics of tumour cells and their\nadaptation to hypoxic and acidic microenvironments. Moreover, such results\ndemonstrate how nonlinear interactions between tumour cells and abiotic factors\ncan lead to the formation of environmental gradients which select for cells\nwith phenotypic characteristics that vary with distance from intra-tumour blood\nvessels, thus promoting the emergence of intra-tumour phenotypic heterogeneity.\nFinally, our theoretical findings reconcile the conclusions of earlier studies\nby showing that the order in which resistance to hypoxia and resistance to\nacidity arise in tumours depend on the ways in which oxygen and lactate act as\nenvironmental stressors in the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cells.\n",

These models generally\nconsist of a balance equation for the cell density, one for the density of the\nextracellular matrix (ECM), and a force-balance equation describing the\nmechanical equilibrium of the cell-ECM system. Assuming this system can be\nregarded as an isotropic linear viscoelastic material, the force-balance\nequation is often defined using the Kelvin-Voigt model of linear\nviscoelasticity to represent the stress-strain relation of the ECM. However,\ndue to the multifaceted bio-physical nature of the ECM constituents, there are\nrheological aspects that cannot be effectively captured by this model and,\ntherefore, depending on the type of biological tissue considered, other\nconstitutive models of linear viscoelasticity may be better suited. In this\nwork, we systematically assess the pattern formation potential of different\nstress-strain constitutive equations for the ECM within a mechanical model of\npattern formation in biological tissues. The results obtained through linear\nstability analysis support the idea that constitutive equations capturing\nviscous flow and permanent set (Maxwell model, Jeffrey model) have a pattern\nformation potential much higher than the others (Kelvin-Voigt model, standard\nlinear solid model), further confirmed by the results of our numerical\nsimulations. Our findings suggest that further empirical work is required to\nacquire detailed quantitative information on the mechanical properties of\ncomponents of the ECM in different biological tissues in order to furnish\nmechanochemical models of pattern formation with stress-strain constitutive\nequations for the ECM that provide a more faithful representation of the\nunderlying tissue rheology.\n",

By fluorescence stereomicroscopy and layer-by-layer\ndissection after the rabbits were sacrificed, the perivascular and adventitial\nconnective tissues (PACT) along the saphenous veins and inferior vena cava were\nfound to be stained by sodium fluorescein from ankle dermis, which coincided\nwith the findings by MRI.

Claudin and Occludin are integral membrane proteins found in tight\njunctions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression level\nof claudin and occludin in human colorectal cancer. Method: In this study, 38\ncolorectal cancer patients who referred to Cancer Institute of Imam Khomeini\nHospital in Tehran, Iran were studied after obtaining the informed consent.\nFirst, quantitative extraction of RNA was performed, then the expression levels\nof claudin and Occludin genes were examined by reverse transcription, PCR, and\nReal-time PCR. Findings: The expression levels of both claudin and Occludin\ngenes in cases with higher stage and grade of disease, in the state of\nmetastasis were more than those of the control samples. Conclusion: The\nincreased expression level of the mentioned genes can be considered as an\ninfluential factor in turning the normal healthy tissues into cancerous cells.\n",

Its etiology remains enigmatic despite\nintense research efforts over many decades. By use of empirically\nwell-constrained computer models describing the coupled function of the\nbaroreceptor reflex and mechanics of the circulatory system, we demonstrate\nquantitatively that arterial stiffening seems sufficient to explain age-related\nemergence of hypertension. Specifically, the empirically observed chronic\nchanges in pulse pressure with age, and the impaired capacity of hypertensive\nindividuals to regulate short-term changes in blood pressure, arise as emergent\nproperties of the integrated system. Results are consistent with available\nexperimental data from chemical and surgical manipulation of the\ncardio-vascular system. In contrast to widely held opinions, the results\nsuggest that primary hypertension can be attributed to a mechanogenic etiology\nwithout challenging current conceptions of renal and sympathetic nervous system\nfunction. The results support the view that a major target for treating chronic\nhypertension in the elderly is the reestablishment of a proper baroreflex\nresponse.\n",

The\nradiographs of 1,954 elderly Chinese men (mean: 72.3 years) and 1,953 elderly\nChinese women (mean: 72.5 years) were evaluated. Results: according to ABQ,\ngrade-1,-2,-3 VFs accounted for 1.89%, 1.74%, 2.25% in men, and 3.33%, 3.07%,\nand 5.53% in women. In men and women, 15.7% (35/223) and 34.5% (48/139) of\nvertebrae with SQ grade-1 deformity were ABQ(+, with fracture) respectively. In\nmen and women, 89.7% (35/39) and 66.7% (48/72) of vertebrae with ABQ grade-1\nfracture had SQ grade-1 deformity. For grade-1 change, SQ (-, negative without\nfracture) & ABQ (+, positive with vertebral cortex line fracture) subjects tend\nto have a lower BMD than the SQ(+)& ABQ(-) subjects.

        "summary": "  Rotors are functional reentry sources identified in clinically relevant\ncardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular and atrial fibrillation. Ablation\ntargeting rotor sites has resulted in arrhythmia termination. Recent clinical,\nexperimental and modelling studies demonstrate that rotors are often anchored\naround fibrotic scars or regions with increased fibrosis. However the\nmechanisms leading to abundance of rotors at these locations are not clear. The\ncurrent study explores the hypothesis whether fibrotic scars just serve as\nanchoring sites for the rotors or whether there are other active processes\nwhich drive the rotors to these fibrotic regions. Rotors were induced at\ndifferent distances from fibrotic scars of various sizes and degree of\nfibrosis. Simulations were performed in a 2D model of human ventricular tissue\nand in a patient-specific model of the left ventricle of a patient with remote\nmyocardial infarction. In both the 2D and the patient-specific model we found\nthat without fibrotic scars, the rotors were stable at the site of their\ninitiation. However, in the presence of a scar, rotors were eventually\ndynamically anchored from large distances by the fibrotic scar via a process of\ndynamical reorganization of the excitation pattern. This process coalesces with\na change from polymorphic to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n",

Structural components and their interfacial\nmechanical strength of arterial tissue play a critical role in the process of\narterail delamination. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the\nmicromechanical mechanisms of arterial delamination. The objective of this\nstudy was to investigate various failure mechanisms (e.g. failure of collagen\nfibers) responsible for arterial interfacial delamination. In-situ tensile\ntests of fibers were performed on a micro-tester in the scanning electron\nmicroscope. A 3D unit cell model containing an individual fiber bridging two\narterial tissue layers was constructed. An exponential cohesive zone model\n(CZM) was used to assess the stiffening and softening mechanical behaviors of\ncollagen fiber bundles between the two arterial layers. An anisotropic\nconstitutive model was implemented for characterizing the mechanical properties\nof the amorphous matrix which includes the fibrous cap and the underlying\nplaque tissue and a nonlinear elastic model was adopted for characterizing the\nmechanical properties of the fibers. The CZM and elastic parameter values of\nfibers were identified through an inverse boundary value approach that matches\nthe load-displacement curves from simulation predictions of tensile test of\ncollagen fibers with experimental measurements. The identified parameter values\nwere then used as input in the 3D unit cell model, through which\nmicromechanical factors affecting the resultant traction-separation relation\nfor the unit cell were investigated via a parametric analysis. Results of the\nparametric analysis showed the applicability of the 3D unit cell model approach\nfor evaluating the micromechanical mechanisms of arterial tissue failure\nprocesses.\n",

The valve is composed of leaflets, the\nfree edges of which are supported by a system of chordae, which themselves are\nanchored to the papillary muscles inside the left ventricle. First, we examine\nvalve anatomy and present the results of original dissections. These display\nthe gross anatomy and information on fiber structure of the mitral valve. Next,\nwe build a model valve following a design-based methodology, meaning that we\nderive the model geometry and the forces that are needed to support a given\nload, and construct the model accordingly. We incorporate information from the\ndissections to specify the fiber topology of this model. We assume the valve\nachieves mechanical equilibrium while supporting a static pressure load. The\nsolution to the resulting differential equations determines the pressurized\nconfiguration of the valve model. To complete the model we then specify a\nconstitutive law based on a stress-strain relation consistent with experimental\ndata that achieves the necessary forces computed in previous steps. Finally,\nusing the immersed boundary method, we simulate the model valve in fluid in a\ncomputer test chamber. The model opens easily and closes without leak when\ndriven by physiological pressures over multiple beats. Further, its closure is\nrobust to driving pressures that lack atrial systole or are much lower or\nhigher than normal.\n",

The\ninterconnections between cells determine the set of spatial modes that are\namplified or suppressed based on the coupling and internal dynamics of each\ncell, analogously to the way a traditional digital filter modifies the\nfrequency components of a discrete signal. We apply the framework to two\nsystems in developmental biology: the Notch-Delta interaction that shapes\n\\textit{Drosophila} wing veins and the Sox9/Bmp/Wnt network responsible for\ndigit formation in vertebrate limbs. The latter case study demonstrates that\nTuring-like patterns may occur even in the absence of instabilities.

They flow out of kino veins,\nschizolysigenous ducts composing an anatomically distinct continuous system of\ntangentially anastomosing lacunae produced by the vascular cambium, which\nencircle the plant. Kino is secreted holocrinously into the vein lumen by a\ncambiform epithelium lined by suberized cells that separate kino veins from the\nsurrounding axial parenchyma. A model describing kino flow in eucalypts is\npresented to investigate how vein distribution and structure, as well as kino\nholocrine loading, crystallization, and viscosity affect flow. Considering\nviscosity, vein anatomy, and a time-dependent holocrine loading of kino, the\nunsteady Stokes equation was applied. Qualitatively, kino flow is similar to\nresin flow. There is an increase in flow towards the vein open end, and both\npressure and flow depend on vein dimensions, kino properties and holocrine\nloading. However, kino veins present a much smaller specific resistance to flow\ncompared to resin ducts. Also, unlike resin loading in conifers, holocrine kino\nloading is not pressure-driven. The pressure and pressure gradient required to\ndrive an equally fast flow are smaller than what is observed on the resin ducts\nof conifers. These results agree with previous observations on some angiosperms\nand suggest that holocrinous gum flow may have lower metabolic energy costs;\nthus presenting physiological advantages and possibly constituting an\nevolutionary step of angiosperms in using internal secretory systems in plant\ndefence mechanisms compared to resin flow in conifers. Understanding of how\nthese physiological and morphological parameters affect kino flow might be\nuseful for selecting species and developing more sustainable and economically\nviable methods of tapping gum and gum resin in angiosperms.\n",

METHODS A total of 740 unbound\nMPA (uMPA), 741 total MPA (tMPA) and 734 total MPAG (tMPAG) concentration-time\ndata from 58 Chinese kidney transplant patients were analysed using a nonlinear\nmixed-effect model. The influence of covariates was tested using a stepwise\nprocedure. RESULTS The PK of unbound MPA and MPAG were characterised by a two-\nand one-compartment model with first-order elimination, respectively. Apparent\nclearance of uMPA (CLuMPA/F) was estimated to be 852 L/h with a relative\nstandard error (RSE) of 7.1%. The tMPA and uMPA were connected using a linear\nprotein binding model, in which the protein binding rate constant (kB)\nincreased non-linearly with the serum albumin (ALB) concentration. The\nestimated kB was 53.4 /h (RSE, 2.3%) for patients with ALB of 40 g/L. In\naddition, model-based simulation showed that changes in ALB substantially\naffected tMPA but not uMPA exposure. CONCLUSIONS The established model\nadequately described the population PK characteristics of the uMPA, tMPA, and\nMPAG. The estimated CLuMPA/F and unbound fraction of MPA (FUMPA) in Chinese\nkidney transplant recipients were comparable to those published previously in\nCaucasians.

In\nparticular, the combination of therapeutic bacteria and conventional\nchemotherapy leads to dramatically high anti-tumor efficay. However, the\nmechanisms of the synergy, in part, remain unclear. To aim for understanding\nthe mechanisms of the synergy of the combination therapy, simultaneous delivery\nof C. novyi-NT and chemotherapeutic agents in tumors is mathematically modeled\nfrom porous media approach. Simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors after\nDoxil administration with or without bacteria agreed reasonably well with\nexperimental literature. The simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors by\nthe combination of Doxil and C. novyi-NT is over twice higher than that of\nDoxil alone, as observed in previous experimental literature. This enhanced\nconcentration is because of the degradation of extracellular matrix of collagen\nby bacterial proteolytic activity, which reduced interstitial fluid pressure in\ntumors by increasing hydraulic conductivity of interstitium, and thus increases\nconvection through vessel walls. Additionally, solid stress alleviation caused\nby collagen degradation increases vessel density by decompressing blood\nvessels. On the other hand, the simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors\nfor non-liposomal doxorubicin is not enhanced by C. novyi-NT because vascular\npermeability of free-doxorubicin is larger than Doxil, and thus, increased but\nrelatively small convection across vessel walls is outweighed by the efflux due\nto increased interstitial flow. A strategy to further enhance this combination\ntherapy is discussed with sensitivity analysis.\n",

        "summary": "  What are the general principles that allow proper growth of a tissue or an\norgan? A growing leaf is an example of such a system: it increases its area by\norders of magnitude, maintaining a proper (usually flat) shape. How can this be\nachieved without a central control unit? One would think that a combination of\nuniform growth with viscoelastic rheology would allow that. Here we show that\nthat the exact opposite process is in action: the natural growth of the leaf\nsurface strongly fluctuates in time and position. By combining high resolution\nmeasurements and multi-scale statistical analysis, we suggest a paradigm-change\nin the way leaf growth is viewed. We measure the in-plane tissue growth of\nTobacco leaves in Lagrangian coordinates in 3D and study the statistics of\nthree scalar fields associated with the tensorial growth field: The growth\nrate, its isotropy and directionality. We identify the governing time and\nlength scales of the fluctuations in the growth rate, and capture abundant\nswitching between local area swelling and shrinking, when measured in high\nresolution. At lower spatio-temporal resolution the growth rate field becomes\nsmooth. In contrast, the anisotropy field increases over time. Finally, we find\nsignificant differences between growth measured during day and night. The\ngrowth at night is found to be more intermittent, with shorter correlation\nlengths and no global directionality. Despite its fluctuative nature, growth\nfields are not random, thus carry information about growth regulation. Indeed,\nmechanical analysis shows that a growing leaf can stay flat only if the\nmeasured fluctuations are regulated/correlated. Our measurements suggest that\nthe entire statistics of growth fields, and not just their means, should be\nstudied. In particular, the regulation of such fields and the link between\ntheir characteristics and the global geometry of a leaf should be studied.\n",

As an organism\nages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined\nperformance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease\nand death. In this study we develop a mathematical framework of coupled innate\nand adaptive immune responses, namely the integrated immune branch (IIB) model.\nThis model describes dynamics of immune components in both branches, uses a\nshape-space representation to encode pathogen-specific immune memory, and\nexhibits three steady states -- health, septic death, and chronic inflammation\n-- qualitatively similar to clinically-observed immune outcomes. In this model,\nthe immune system (initialized in the health state) is subjected to a sequence\nof pathogen encounters, and we use the number of prior pathogen encounters as a\nproxy for the \"age\" of the immune system. We find that repeated pathogen\nencounters may trigger a fragility in which any encounter with a novel pathogen\nwill cause the system to irreversibly switch from health to chronic\ninflammation. This transition is consistent with the onset of \"inflammaging\", a\ncondition observed in aged individuals who experience chronic low-grade\ninflammation even in the absence of pathogens. The IIB model predicts that the\nonset of chronic inflammation strongly depends on the history of encountered\npathogens; the timing of onset differs drastically when the same set of\ninfections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the innate\nand adaptive immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen\nclearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence.\n",

        "summary": "  Unlike other organs, the thymus and gonads generate non-uniform cell\npopulations, many members of which perish, and a few survive. While it is\nrecognized that thymic cells are 'audited' to optimize an organism's immune\nrepertoire, whether gametogenesis could be orchestrated similarly to favour\nhigh quality gametes is uncertain. Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at\nearly stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is\nhere made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality\ncontrol mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through\ndetection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental\nDNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically\nderived. This 'stress test' is achieved in the same way that thymic screening\nfor potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved - by 'promiscuous'\nexpression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes\nthat are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire\ngene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes\nfunction in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid\nincompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents\n(rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins\nthat are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this\nbasis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in\ngamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant\nprotein aggregates that cause apoptosis. This mechanism would later have been\nco-opted by thymic epithelial cells which display peptides from aggregates to\nremove potentially autoreactive T cells.\n",

        "summary": "  Lymphedema, a disfiguring condition characterized by the asymmetrical\nswelling of the limbs, is suspected to be caused by dysfunctions in the\nlymphatic system. Lymphangions, the spontaneously contracting units of the\nlymphatic system, are sensitive to luminal wall shear stress. In this study,\nthe response of the lymphangions to dynamically varying wall shear stress is\ncharacterized in isolated rat thoracic ducts in relation to their shear\nsensitivity. The critical shear stress above which the thoracic duct shows\nsubstantial inhibition of contraction was found to be significantly negatively\ncorrelated to the diameter of the lymphangion. The entrainment of the\nlymphangion to an applied oscillatory shear stress was found to be\nsignificantly dependent on the difference between the applied frequency and\nintrinsic frequency of contraction of the lymphangion. The strength of\nentrainment was also positively correlated to the applied shear stress when\nthis shear was below the critical shear stress. The results suggest an\nadaptation of the lymphangion contractility to the existing oscillatory\nmechanical shear stress as a function of its intrinsic contractility and shear\nsensitivity. These adaptations might be crucial to ensure synchronized\ncontraction of adjacent lymphangions through mechanosensitive means and might\nhelp explain the lymphatic dysfunctions that result from impaired\nmechanosensitivity.\n",

However, these\nmethods have major weaknesses which encourage the development of synthetic bone\ngraft substitutes. A bioresorbable and physiologically load sustaining graft\nsubstitute was fabricated from polylactic acid using 3D printing, a versatile\nmethod which enables parameters to be customizable in a patient-specific\nmanner. The internal architecture consists of vertical and horizontal conduits\nthat are organized to achieve gradients in porosity and pore size in the radial\ndirection to emulate cortical bone encapsulating cancellous bone. A diameter of\n30mm and height of 10mm was designed to target the repair of critically sized\nlong bone defects. The compressive properties of these graft substitutes were\ndetermined to be comparable to adult human femurs. Furthermore, dynamic fatigue\ntesting at twice the human torso weight (800N) indicated that the bone graft\nsubstitute achieved stability as quickly as 200,000 cycles, suggesting its\nability to support weight bearing loads while it gradually degrades as bone\ncells proliferate and mineralize. Additionally, the graft substitutes were\nseeded with human fetal osteoblasts to validate homogenous cellular attachment\nand cytocompatibility. Graft substitutes were also dynamically cultured for 28\ndays under various loading regimens using human mesenchymal stem cell\ndifferentiated osteoblasts, and these resulting tissue constructs were\nsubjected to fatigue testing. The frequency of loading during dynamic culturing\nhad a profound effect on the rate of mineralization which was particularly high\nat 2Hz, confirmed by Alizarin Red staining of the calcium deposits. Taken\ntogether, these bone graft substitutes have potential for use as orthopaedic\nimplants to facilitate the repair of critically sized bone defects.\n",

New human computer models use stresses and\nstrains to evaluate whether serious or fatal injuries are reached,\nunfortunately these tensors bear no direct relation to AIS. This paper proposes\nto overcome this deficiency and suggests a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able\nto calculate the risk to life based on the severity on any organ injury,\nfocussing on real-life pedestrian accidents. The OTM uses a power method, named\nPeak Virtual Power (PVP), and calculates the risk to life of brain white and\ngrey matters as a function of impact direction and impact speed. The OTM\nfirstly calibrates PVP against the medical critical AIS threshold observed in\neach part of the head as a function of speed. This base PVP critical trauma\nfunction is then scaled and banded across all AIS levels using the confirmed\nproperty that AIS and the probability of death is statistically and numerically\na cubic one. The OTM model has been tested against four real-life pedestrian\naccidents and proven to be able to predict pedestrian head trauma severity. In\nsome cases, the method did however under-estimate the head trauma by 1 AIS\nlevel, because of post-impact haemorrhage which cannot be captured with the\nemployed Lagrangian Finite Element (FE) solver. It is also shown that the\nlocation of the injury predictions using PVP coincide with the post mortem\nreports and are different to the predictions made using maximum principal\nstrain.\n",

Here, we quantify\nthe relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to head\nstabilization using a musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and\nrate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion\nmild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or\ncocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated\nangular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during head\nimpact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase,\nactive musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the\nimpact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This\nwas reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase,\nactive musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse\nin experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments\nprovided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The\nredistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle\ndependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared\nto active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively\ngreater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectiveness\nof muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.\n",

Major systemic-and procedural-based issues have subsequently been\nidentified in both clinical trials and preclinical animal model\nexperimentation. As well, issues related to the neuroprotective moiety itself\nhave contributed to clinical trial failures, including late delivery,\nmono-targeting, low potency and poor tolerability. Conditioning (pre-or post-)\nstrategies can potentially address these issues and are therefore gaining\nincreasing attention as approaches to protect the brain from cerebral ischemia.\nIn principle, conditioning can address concerns of timing (preconditioning\ncould be pre-emptively applied in high-risk patients, and post-conditioning\nafter patients experience an unannounced brain infarction) and signaling\n(multi-modal). However, acute neuroprotection and conditioning strategies face\na common translational issue: a myriad of possibilities exist, but with no\nstrategy to select optimal candidates. In this review, we argue that what is\nrequired is a neuroprotective framework to identify the \"best\" agent(s), at the\nearliest investigational stage possible. This may require switching mindsets\nfrom identifying how neuroprotection can be achieved to determining how\nneuroprotection can fail, for the vast majority of candidates. Understanding\nthe basis for failure can in turn guide supplementary treatment, thereby\nforming an evidence-based rationale for selecting combinations of therapies. An\nappropriately designed in vitro (neuron culture, brain slices) approach, based\non increasing the harshness of the ischemic-like insult, can be useful in\nidentifying the \"best\" conditioner or acute neuroprotective therapy, as well as\nhow the two modalities can be combined to overcome individual limitations. This\nwould serve as a base from which to launch further investigation into therapies\nrequired to protect the neurovascular unit in in vivo animal models of cerebral\nischemia. Based on these respective approaches, our laboratories suggest that\nthere is merit in examining synaptic activity-and nutraceutical-based\npreconditioning / acute neuroprotection.\n",

The results of\nthese strain-controlled cyclic loading tests also indicated that the extent of\nsoftening is different for different strain rates and orientations. Also a\nsubstantial hysteresis persists even at very low strain rates indicating\ninelastic behavior beyond the rate sensitive viscoelastic response. Through\nthis series of experiments, by investigating the effect of strain rate on pig\nskin and rat skin, we conclude that the skin response is rate dependent but\ninelastic and shows irreversible changes in fiber orientation which are\nobserved in histology results.

        "summary": "  To sustain metabolism, intracellular ATP concentration must be regulated\nwithin an appropriate range. This coordination is achieved through the function\nof the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular \"fuel gauge\" that is\nexpressed in essentially all eukaryotic cells as heterotrimeric complexes\ncontaining catalytic $\\alpha$ subunits and regulatory $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$\nsubunits. When cellular energy status has been compromised, AMPK is activated\nby increases in AMP:ATP or ADP:ATP ratios and acts to restore energy\nhomeostasis by stimulating energy production via catabolic pathways while\ndecreasing non-essential energy-consuming pathways. Although the primary\nfunction of AMPK is to regulate energy homeostasis at a cell-autonomous level,\nin multicellular organisms, the AMPK system has evolved to interact with\nhormones to regulate energy intake and expenditure at the whole body level.\nThus, AMPK functions as a signaling hub, coordinating anabolic and catabolic\npathways to balance nutrient supply with energy demand at both the cellular and\nwhole-body levels. AMPK is activated by various metabolic stresses such as\nischemia or hypoxia or glucose deprivation and has both acute and long-term\neffects on metabolic pathways and key cellular functions. In addition, AMPK\nappears to be a major sensor of energy demand in exercising muscle and acts\nboth as a multitask gatekeeper and an energy regulator in skeletal muscle.\nAcute activation of AMPK has been shown to promote glucose transport and fatty\nacid oxidation while suppressing glycogen synthase activity and protein\nsynthesis. Chronic activation of AMPK induces a shift in muscle fiber type\ncomposition, reduces markers of muscle degeneration and enhances muscle\noxidative capacity potentially by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis.\nFurthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that AMPK may not only regulate\nmetabolism during exercise but also in the recovery phase. AMPK acts as a\nmolecular transducer between exercise and insulin signaling and is necessary\nfor the ability of prior contraction/exercise to increase muscle insulin\nsensitivity. Based on these observations, drugs that activate AMPK might be\nexpected to be useful in the treatment of metabolic disorders and insulin\nresistance in various conditions.\n",

An emphasis is given to computational models for drug development.\nFuture trends are discussed.\n",

In this\nprocess, the circulating tumor cells inside the blood vessels adhere to the\ncell monolayer of the blood vessel wall and passes through it, which allows\nthem to invade different organs and complete metastasis. In this process, it is\nrelevant to understand how the adhesions between cells that form the\nendothelial monolayer are broken, resulting in intra-cellular gaps through\nwhich tumor cells are able to extravasate the blood vessel wall.\n  Within this process, we focus on studying the dynamics of cell-cell junctions\nrupture produced in the endothelial monolayer by the effect of Calcium waves.\nThe regulation of this monolayer is of vital importance, not only in\nmetastasis, but also in diseases such as pulmonary edema or atherosclerosis.\n  In order to understand this rupture dynamics in greater depth, we propose a\nhybrid model that simulates endothelial cells as \\textcolor{black}{an} elastic\nmaterial and cell-cell adhesions of the monolayer by means of a catch bond law.\n  We study the effects that the cell contraction caused by a Calcium wave\npresents on the endothelial monolayer depending on the diameter of the blood\nvessel. For this purpose, we develop a three-dimensional model to study the\neffect of the different blood vessel diameters.\n  The results indicate that there are greater tractions on the joints located\nin vertices common to several cells. This led to the formation of openings in\nthe endothelial monolayer, through which extravasation of tumor cells could\noccur. For the different geometries studied, no significant effect of the blood\nvessel diameter on the rupture of the adhesions of monolayer is observed.\n",

The effects of the flow resistance,\narterial compliance, and inertia of blood on the flow rate were also\ninvestigated. The flow rate decreased with increasing inertia of the blood and\nflow resistance and decreasing arterial compliance. The height and position of\nthe secondary peak were determined by a combination of the flow resistance,\narterial compliance, and blood inertance. The results suggest that the risk of\nhypertension may increase with age because decreases in flow rate due to an\nincrease in flow resistance and a decrease in arterial compliance were more\nsubstantial than the increase in flow rate caused by a decrease in blood\ninertance.

Although each single process has been systematically\ninvestigated, a quantitative understanding on their interaction remains limited\nand hence identifying optimal drug and formulation characteristics for orally\ninhaled drugs is still challenging. To investigate this complex interplay, the\npulmonary processes can be integrated into mathematical models. However,\nexisting modeling attempts considerably simplify these processes or are not\nsystematically evaluated against (clinical) data. In this work, we developed a\nmathematical framework based on physiologically-structured population equations\nto integrate all relevant pulmonary processes mechanistically. A tailored\nnumerical resolution strategy was chosen and the mechanistic model was\nevaluated systematically against different clinical datasets. Without any\nparameter estimation based on individual study data, the developed model\nsimultaneously predicted (1) lung retention profiles of inhaled insoluble\nparticles, (2) particle size-dependent PK of inhaled monodisperse particles,\n(3) PK differences between inhaled fluticasone propionate and budesonide, and\n(4) PK differences between healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Finally,\nto identify the most impactful optimization criteria for orally inhaled drugs,\nwe investigated the impact of input parameters on both pulmonary and systemic\nexposure. Solubility of the inhaled drug did not have any relevant impact on\nlocal and systemic PK. Instead, pulmonary dissolution rate, particle size,\ntissue affinity, and systemic clearance were impactful potential optimization\nparameters. In the future, the developed prediction framework should be\nconsidered a powerful tool to identify optimal drug and formulation\ncharacteristics.\n",

Our earlier data exhibited that both the infused volume\nand the infusion rate can regulate the initial disposition of the administered\nsolute within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). On the other hand, fast additions\nof large volumes of liquid to the CSF inevitably raise the intracranial\npressure (ICP), which may in turn lead to adverse reactions if the\nphysiologically delimited threshold is exceeded. While long-term biological\neffects of elevated ICP (hydrocephalus) are known, the safety thresholds\npertaining to short-term ICP elevations caused by IT infusions have not yet\nbeen characterized. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of ICP in rats\nand non-human primates (NHPs) with respect to IT infusion rates and volumes.\nThe data revealed that the addition of a liquid to the CSF raised the ICP in a\nrate and volume-dependent manner. At low infusion rates (<0.12 ml/min in rats\nand <2 ml/min in NHPs), NHPs and rats displayed similar tolerance patterns for\nextended durations. Specifically, safe accommodations of such added volumes\nwere mainly facilitated by the accelerated pressure-dependent CSF drainage into\nthe blood, with ICPs stabilizing at different levels below the safety threshold\nof 28+/-4 mm Hg in rats and 50+/-5 mm Hg in NHPs. High infusion rates caused\nuncompensated ICP elevations rapidly exceeding the safety thresholds. Their\ntolerance was species-dependent and was facilitated by the compensatory role of\nthe varied components of craniospinal compliance while not excluding the\npossibility of other contributing factors. In conclusion, large volumes of\nliquids can safely be delivered via IT routes provided that ICP is monitored as\na safety factor and cross-species physiological differences are accounted for.\n",

It has recently been reported that a\nlong-distance interstitial fluid (ISF) circulatory pathway may originate from\nthe acupoints in the extremities. As observed in living human subjects,\ncadavers and animals using magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescent tracers,\nthe ISF flow pathways include at least 4 types of anatomical structures: the\ncutaneous-, perivenous-, periarterial-, and neural-pathways. Unlike the blood\nor lymphatic vessels, these ISF flow pathways are composed of highly ordered\nand topologically connected interstitial fibrous connective tissues that may\nwork as guiderails for the ISF to flow actively over long distance under\ncertain driving forces. Our experimental results demonstrated that most\nacupoints in the extremity endings connect with one or more ISF flow pathways\nand comprise a complex network of acupoint-ISF-pathways. We also found that\nthis acupoint-ISF-pathway network can connect to visceral organs or tissues\nsuch as the pericardium and epicardium, even though the topographical geometry\nin human extremities does not totally match the meridian lines on the atlas\nthat is currently used in traditional Chinese medicine.

CTEPH treatment aims to reduce pulmonary\narterial pressure and reestablish adequate lung perfusion, yet patients with\ndistal lesions are inoperable by standard surgical intervention. Instead, these\npatients undergo balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), a multi-session,\nminimally invasive surgery that disrupts the thromboembolic material within the\nvessel lumen using a catheter balloon. However, there still lacks an\nintegrative, holistic tool for identifying optimal target lesions for\ntreatment. To address this insufficiency, we simulate CTEPH hemodynamics and\nBPA therapy using a multiscale fluid dynamics model. The large pulmonary\narterial geometry is derived from a computed tomography (CT) image, whereas a\nfractal tree represents the small vessels. We model ring- and web-like lesions,\ncommon in CTEPH, and simulate normotensive conditions and four CTEPH disease\nscenarios; the latter includes both large artery lesions and vascular\nremodeling. BPA therapy is simulated by simultaneously reducing lesion severity\nin three locations. Our predictions mimic severe CTEPH, manifested by an\nincrease in mean proximal pulmonary arterial pressure above 20 mmHg and\nprominent wave reflections. Both flow and pressure decrease in vessels distal\nto the lesions and increase in unobstructed vascular regions. We use the main\npulmonary artery (MPA) pressure, a wave reflection index, and a measure of flow\nheterogeneity to select optimal target lesions for BPA. In summary, this study\nprovides a multiscale, image-to-hemodynamics pipeline for BPA therapy planning\nfor inoperable CTEPH patients.\n",

        "summary": "  Aim The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of cyclosporine (CsA) in renal\ntransplant recipients are patient- and time-dependent. Knowledge of this\ntime-related variability is necessary to maintain or achieve CsA target\nexposure. Here, we aimed to identify factors explaining variabilities in CsA PK\nproperties and characterise time-dependent clearance (CL/F) by performing a\ncomprehensive analysis of CsA PK factors using population PK (popPK) modelling\nof long-term follow-up data from our institution. Methods In total, 3,674\nwhole-blood CsA concentrations from 183 patients who underwent initial renal\ntransplantation were analysed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The\neffects of potential covariates were selected according to a previous report\nand well-accepted theoretical mechanisms. Model-informed individualised\ntherapeutic regimens were also conducted. Results A two-compartment model\nadequately described the data and the estimated mean CsA CL/F was 32.6 L h-1\n(5%). Allometrically scaled body size, haematocrit (HCT) level, CGC haplotype\ncarrier status, and postoperative time may contribute to CsA PK variability.\nThe CsA bioavailability in patients receiving a prednisolone dose (PD) of 80 mg\nwas 20.6% lower than that in patients receiving 20 mg. A significant decrease\n(52.6%) in CL/F was observed as the HCT increased from 10.5% to 60.5%. The CL/F\nof the non-CGC haplotype carrier was 14.4% lower than that of the CGC haplotype\ncarrier at 3 months post operation. CsA dose adjustments should be considered\nin different postoperative periods. Conclusions By monitoring body size, HCT,\nPD, and CGC haplotype, changes in CsA CL/F over time could be predicted. Such\ninformation could be used to optimise CsA therapy.\n",

        "summary": "  Collagen fibrils are the most important structural component of tendons.\nTheir crimped structure and parallel arrangement within the tendon lead to a\ndistinctive non-linear stress-strain curve when a tendon is stretched.\nMicrostructural models can be used to relate microscale collagen fibril\nmechanics to macroscale tendon mechanics, allowing us to identify the\nmechanisms behind each feature present in the stress-strain curve. Most models\nin the literature focus on the elastic behaviour of the tendon, and there are\nfew which model beyond the elastic limit without introducing phenomenological\nparameters. We develop a model, built upon a collagen recruitment approach,\nthat only contains microstructural parameters. We split the stress in the\nfibrils into elastic and plastic parts, and assume that the fibril yield\nstretch and rupture stretch are each described by a distribution function,\nrather than being single-valued. By changing the shapes of the distributions\nand their regions of overlap, we can produce macroscale tendon stress-strain\ncurves that generate the full range of features observed experimentally,\nincluding those that could not be explained using existing models. These\nfeatures include second linear regions occurring after the tendon has yielded,\nand step-like failure behaviour present after the stress has peaked. When we\ncompare with an existing model, we find that our model reduces the average root\nmean squared error from 4.15MPa to 1.61MPa, and the resulting parameter values\nare closer to those found experimentally. Since our model contains only\nparameters that have a direct physical interpretation, it can be used to\npredict how processes such as ageing, disease, and injury affect the mechanical\nbehaviour of tendons, provided we can quantify the effects of these processes\non the microstructure.\n",

In some patients, through unknown mechanisms, Ipc-PH transitions to\ncombined pre-/post-capillary PH (Cpc-PH), diagnosed by an increase in pulmonary\nvascular resistance and associated with a dramatic increase in mortality. We\nhypothesize that altered mechanical forces and subsequent vasoactive signaling\nin the pulmonary capillary bed drive the transition from Ipc-PH to Cpc-PH.\nHowever, even in a healthy pulmonary circulation, the mechanical forces in the\nsmallest vessels (the arterioles, venules, and capillary bed) have not been\nquantitatively defined. This study is the first to examine this question via a\ncomputational fluid dynamics model of the human pulmonary arteries, veins,\narterioles, and venules. Using this model we predict temporal and spatial\ndynamics of cyclic stretch and wall shear stress. In the large vessels,\nnumerical simulations show that shear stress increases coincides with larger\nflow and pressure. In the microvasculature, we found that as vessel radius\ndecreases, shear stress increases and flow decreases. In arterioles, this\ncorresponds with lower pressures; however, the venules and smaller veins have\nhigher pressure than larger veins. Our model provides predictions for pressure,\nflow, shear stress, and cyclic stretch that provides a way to analyze and\ninvestigate hypotheses related to disease progression in the pulmonary\ncirculation.\n",

So far, the outcome of\ntherapy could be improved with the design of 3D implants, which combine the\nmerits of osseous regeneration and local multidrug therapy so as to avoid\nbacterial growth, drug resistance and the feared side effects. Herein,\nhierarchical 3D multidrug scaffolds based on nanocomposite bioceramic and\npolyvinyl alcohol (PVA) prepared by rapid prototyping with an external coating\nof gelatin-glutaraldehyde (Gel-Glu) have been fabricated. These 3D scaffolds\ncontain three antimicrobial agents (rifampin, levofloxacin and vancomycin),\nwhich have been localized in different compartments of the scaffold to obtain\ndifferent release kinetics and more effective combined therapy. Levofloxacin\nwas loaded into the mesopores of nanocomposite bioceramic part, vancomycin was\nlocalized into PVA biopolymer part and rifampin was loaded in the external\ncoating of Gel-Glu. The obtained results show an early and fast release of\nrifampin followed by sustained and prolonged release of vancomycin and\nlevofloxacin, respectively, which are mainly governed by the progressive in\nvitro degradability rate of these scaffolds. This combined therapy is able to\ndestroy Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria biofilms as well as inhibit\nthe bacteria growth; in addition, these multifunctional scaffolds exhibit\nexcellent bioactivity as well as good biocompatibility with complete cell\ncolonization of preosteoblast in the entire surface, ensuring good bone\nregeneration. These findings suggest that these hierarchical 3D multidrug\nscaffolds are promising candidates as platforms for local bone infection\ntherapy.\n",

The biomimetic\nmineralization also occurred throughout the bulk of the scaffold connecting the\nMBGs particles and was responsible for the maintenance of structural integrity.\nIn vitro assays using MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast like cells demonstrated a\nsignificant upregulation of osteogenic-related genes for the scaffolds\npreviously immersed in PBS when compared to the as-printed PVA-containing\nscaffolds. Although the pre-immersion scaffolds performed equally towards\nosteogenic cell differentiation, our data suggest that a short immersion in PBS\nof MBG scaffolds is beneficial for the osteogenic properties and might\naccelerate bone formation after implantation.\n",

The vitamin D status of the population has\nbeen found to be an important factor that could influence outcome of COVID-19.\nHowever, whether vitamin D can lessen the symptoms or severity of COVID-19\nstill remains controversial. Methods: A total of 719 patients with confirmed\nCOVID-19 were enrolled retrospectively in this study from April 13 to June 6,\n2022 at Shanghai Forth People's Hospital. The circulating levels of 25(OH)D3,\ninflammatory factors, and clinical parameters were assayed. Time to viral RNA\nclearance (TVRC), classification and prognosis of COVID-19 were used to\nevaluate the severity of COVID-19 infection. Results: The median age was 76\nyears (interquartile range, IQR, 64.5-84.6), 44.1% of patients were male, and\nthe TVRC was 11 days (IQR, 7-16) in this population. The median level of\n25(OH)D3 was 27.15 (IQR, 19.31-38.89) nmol/L. Patients with lower serum\n25(OH)D3 had prolonged time to viral clearance, more obvious inflammatory\nresponse, more severe respiratory symptoms and higher risks of impaired hepatic\nand renal function. Multiple regression analyses revealed that serum 25(OH)D3\nlevel was negatively associated with TVRC independently. ROC curve showed the\nserum vitamin D level could predict the severity classification and prognosis\nof COVID-19 significantly.Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D3 level is independently\nassociated with the severity of COVID-19 in elderly, and it could be used as a\npredictor of the severity of COVID-19. In addition, supplementation with\nvitamin D might provide beneficial effects in old patients with COVID-19.\n",

Here we determine, via a\nmathematically rigorous framework, which general conditions for the crowding\nfeedback regulation (i) must be minimally met, and (ii) are sufficient, to\nallow the maintenance of homeostasis in renewing tissues. We show that those\nconditions naturally allow for a degree of robustness toward disruption of\nregulation. Furthermore, intrinsic to this feedback regulation is that stem\ncell identity is established collectively by the cell population, not by\nindividual cells, which implies the possibility of `quasi-dedifferentiation',\nin which cells committed to differentiation may reacquire stem cell properties\nupon depletion of the stem cell pool. These findings can guide future\nexperimental campaigns to identify specific crowding feedback mechanisms.\n",

It is certain that\ndifferent biological networks have different optimization criteria and we are\ninterested in those networks optimized for fluid transport within the\ncirculatory system. Many theories currently exist. For instance, distributive\nvascular geometry data is typically consistent with a theoretical model that\nrequires simultaneous minimization of both the power loss of laminar flow and a\ncost function proportional to the total volume of material needed to maintain\nthe system (Murray's law). However, how this optimized system breaks down (or\nis altered) due to disease has yet to be characterized in detail in terms of\nbranching geometry and geometric interrelationships. This is important for\nunderstanding how vasculature remodels under changes of functional demands. For\ninstance, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), drastic cyst development may lead\nto a significant alteration of the vascular geometry (or vascular changes may\nbe a preceding event). Understanding these changes could lead to a better\nunderstanding of early disease as well as development and characterization of\ntreatment interventions. We have developed an optimal transport network model\nwhich simulates distributive vascular systems in health as well as disease in\norder to better understand changes that may occur due to PKD. We found that\nreduced perfusion territories, dilated distributive vasculature, and vessel\nrarefaction are all consequences of cyst development derived from this\ntheoretical model and are a direct result of the increased heterogeneity of\nlocal renal tissue perfusion demands.\n",

We\nstudy the fine temporal structure of this synchrony in healthy young, healthy\nelderly, and elderly subjects with coronary artery disease. We employ novel\ntime-series analysis to explore how phases of oscillations go in and out of the\nphase-locked state at each cycle of oscillations. For the first time we show\nthat cardiorespiratory system is engaged in weakly synchronized dynamics with a\nvery specific temporal patterning of synchrony: the oscillations go out of\nsynchrony frequently, but return to the synchronous state very quickly (usually\nwithin just one cycle of oscillations). Properties of synchrony depended on the\nage and disease status. Healthy subjects exhibited more synchrony at the higher\n(1:4) frequency-locking ratio between respiratory and cardiac rhythms, while\nsubjects with coronary artery disease exhibited relatively more 1:2 synchrony.\nHowever, multiple short desynchronization episodes prevailed regardless of age\nand disease status. The same average synchrony level could alternatively be\nachieved with few long desynchronizations, but this was not observed in the\ndata. This implies functional importance of short desynchronizations dynamics.\nThese dynamics suggest that a synchronous state is easy to create if needed,\nbut is also easy to break. Short desynchronizations dynamics may facilitate the\nmutual coordination of cardiac and respiratory rhythms by creating intermittent\nsynchronous episodes. It may be an efficient background dynamics to promote\nadaptation of cardiorespiratory coordination to various external and internal\nfactors.\n",

Specifically, an oblate\nellipsoidal tumor shape robustly occurs when the tumors grow in hydrogels that\nare stiffer than the tumors, but when they grow in more compliant hydrogels\nthey remain closer to spherical in shape. Using large scale, nonlinear\nelasticity computations we show that the oblate ellipsoidal shape minimizes the\nelastic free energy of the tumor-hydrogel system.

Recent studies have indicated that intra-tumoural heterogeneity has a\nsignificant role in driving resistance to chemotherapy in many human\nmalignancies. Multiple factors including the internal cell-cycle dynamics and\nthe external microenvironement contribute to the intra-tumoural heterogeneity.\nIn this paper we present a hybrid, multiscale, individual-based mathematical\nmodel, incorporating internal cell-cycle dynamics and changes in oxygen\nconcentration, to study the effects of delivery of several different\nchemotherapeutic drugs on the heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer cells with\nvarying cell-cycle dynamics. The computational simulation results from the\nmultiscale model are in good agreement with available experimental data and\nsupport the hypothesis that slow-cycling sub-populations of tumour cells within\na growing tumour mass can induce drug resistance to chemotherapy and thus the\nuse of conventional chemotherapy may actually result in the emergence of\ndominant, therapy-resistant, slow-cycling subpopulations of tumour cells. Our\nresults indicate that the appearance of this chemotherapeutic resistance is\nmainly due to the inability of the administered drug to target all cancer cells\nirrespective of the stage in the cell-cycle they are in i.e. most\nchemotherapeutic drugs target cells in a particular phase/phases of the\ncell-cycle, and hence always spare some cancer cells that are not in the\ntargeted cell-cycle phase/phases. The results also suggest that this\ncell-cycle-mediated drug resistance may be overcome by using multiple doses of\ncell-cycle, phase-specific chemotherapy that targets cells in all phases and\nits appropriate sequencing and scheduling.\n",

Finally, a parameter sensitivity analysis of the model is taken as\na starting point for suggesting new therapeutic approaches targeting the\nenhancement of lymphangiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The work provides a deeper\nunderstanding of the phenomenon in question, clarifying the main factors\ninvolved. In particular, the balance between TGF-$\\beta$ and VEGF levels,\nrather than their absolute values, is identified as crucial to effective\nlymphangiogenesis. In addition, the results indicate lowering the\nmacrophage-mediated activation of TGF-$\\beta$ and increasing the basal\nlymphatic endothelial cell growth rate, \\emph{inter alia}, as potential\ntreatments. It is hoped the findings of this paper may be considered in the\ndevelopment of future experiments investigating novel lymphangiogenic\ntherapies.\n",

It was hypothesized that patterned and\nfunctionalized nanofiber scaffolds could control neurite direction and enhance\nneurite outgrowth. Aligned nanofibers were created according to a mathematical\nmodel and were shown to enable significant control over the direction of\nneurite outgrowth in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)\nneuronal cultures. Laminin-functionalized nanofibers in 3D hyaluronic acid (HA)\nhydrogels enabled significant alignment of neurites with nanofibers, enabled\nsignificant neurite tracking of nanofibers, and significantly increased the\ndistance over which neurites could extend. This work demonstrates the ability\nto create unique 3D neural tissue constructs using a combined system of\nhydrogel and nanofiber scaffolding. Importantly, patterned and\nbiofunctionalized nanofiber scaffolds that can control direction and increase\nlength of neurite outgrowth in three-dimensions hold much potential for neural\ntissue engineering. This approach offers advancements in the development of\nimplantable neural tissue constructs that enable control of neural development\nand reproduction of neuroanatomical pathways, with the ultimate goal being the\nachievement of functional neural regeneration.\n",

Previous reports have shown that this affects the\ngrey matter of the primary visual cortex, but possible effects on the preceding\nvisual pathway structures have not been fully established. Method. In this\nmulticentre study, we used high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance\nimaging and voxel-based morphometry to investigate the visual pathway\nstructures up to the primary visual cortex of patients with age-related macular\ndegeneration (AMD) and juvenile macular degeneration (JMD). Results. Compared\nto age-matched healthy controls, in patients with JMD we found volumetric\nreductions in the optic nerves, the chiasm, the lateral geniculate bodies, the\noptic radiations and the visual cortex. In patients with AMD we found\nvolumetric reductions in the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations\nand the visual cortex. An unexpected finding was that AMD, but not JMD, was\nassociated with a reduction in frontal white matter volume. Conclusion. MD is\nassociated with degeneration of structures along the visual pathways.

We\nseparately consider cell populations that harbor pre-existing resistance to the\ndrug, and those that acquire resistance during the course of treatment. For\neach of these independent scenarios, we consider one hypothetical cell line\nthat is responsive to metronomic chemotherapy, and another that with high\nprobability cannot be eradicated by a metronomic protocol. Motivated by\nexperimental work on ovarian cancer xenografts, we consider all possible\ncombinations of a one week treatment protocol, repeated for three weeks, and\nconstrained by the total weekly drug dose. Simulations reveal a small number of\nfractionated-dose protocols that are at least as effective as metronomic\ntherapy in eradicating micrometastases with acquired resistance (weak or\nstrong), while also being at least as effective on those that harbor weakly\npre-existing resistant cells. Given the responsiveness of very different\ntheoretical cell lines to these few fractionated-dose protocols, these may\nrepresent more effective ways to schedule chemotherapy with the goal of\nlimiting metastatic tumor progression.\n",

Mechanobiological models\nhave been used to investigate the role of various mechanical and biological\nfactors on the bone healing. However, the initial phase of healing, which\nincludes the inflammatory response, the granulation tissue formation and the\ninitial callus formation during the first few days post-fracture, are generally\nneglected in such studies. In this study, we developed a finite-element-based\nmodel to simulate different levels of diffusion coefficient for mesenchymal\nstem cell (MSC) migration, Young's modulus of granulation tissue, callus\nthickness and interfragmentary gap size to understand the modulatory effects of\nthese initial phase parameters on bone healing. The results showed that faster\nMSC migration, stiffer granulation tissue, thicker callus and smaller\ninterfragmentary gap enhanced healing to some extent. After a certain\nthreshold, a state of saturation was reached for MSC migration rate,\ngranulation tissue stiffness and callus thickness. Therefore, a parametric\nstudy was performed to verify that the callus formed at the initial phase, in\nagreement with experimental observations, has an ideal range of geometry and\nmaterial properties to have the most efficient healing time. Findings from this\npaper quantified the effects of the healing initial phase on healing outcome to\nbetter understand the biological and mechanobiological mechanisms and their\nutilization in the design and optimization of treatment strategies. Simulation\noutcomes also demonstrated that for fractures, where bone segments are in close\nproximity, callus development is not required. This finding is consistent with\nthe concepts of primary and secondary bone healing.\n",

In experiments, cells are seeded in a porous SC where\nover a month, the SC slowly degrades while cells divide and synthesize\nextracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. We use an off-lattice cellular\nautomaton framework to model the individual behavior of cells within the SC.\nThe movement of cells and the ability to reproduce is determined by the\nnutrient profile and local porosity. A phenomenological approach is used to\ncapture a continuous profile for SC and ECM evolution, which will then change\nthe local porosity. We parameterize the model by matching total cell counts to\nchondrocytes seeded in a polyglycolic acid SC. We investigate the total cell\ncount and location of various cell populations for different initial SC\nporosities. Similar to experiments, we observe cell counts that level off\naround day 15 with higher values in SCs of lower initial porosity. Cell\nclustering is observed in regions at the edge of the construct that are close\nto the nutrient-rich medium in the fluid bath. Model results show that a bias\nin motion due to sensitivity to porosity allows cells to move in a more optimal\narrangement. We investigate the distribution of cells as the cell reproduction\nrate, cell movement distance, and sensitivity to porosity is varied. We observe\nnon monotonic changes in total cell counts within different regions of the\nconstruct due to the interplay between porosity and cellular movement. We also\nanalyze the emergent average cell speed for different initial SC porosities,\nobserving an higher average for the lowest initial SC porosity.

Recent advances in the theory of\ndissipative vortices, experimental studies, and anatomically realistic computer\nsimulations, elucidated the role of cardiac re-entry interaction with fine\nanatomical features in the heart, and anatomy induced drift. The fact that\nanatomy and structural anisotropy of the heart is consistent within a species\nsuggested its possible functional effect on spontaneous drift of cardiac\nre-entry. A comparative study of the anatomy induced drift could be used in\norder to predict evolution of atrial arrhythmia, and improve low-voltage\ndefibrillation protocols and ablation strategies. Here, in micro-CT based model\nof rat pulmonary vein wall, and in sheep atria models based on high resolution\nserial histological sections, we demonstrate effects of heart geometry and\nanisotropy on cardiac re-entry anatomy induced drift, its pinning to\nfluctuations of thickness in the layer. The data sets of sheep atria and rat\npulmonary vein wall are incorporated into the BeatBox High Performance\nComputing simulation environment. Re-entry is initiated at prescribed locations\nin the spatially homogeneous mono-domain models of cardiac tissue. Excitation\nis described by FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics. In the in-silico models, isotropic\nand anisotropic conduction show specific anatomy effects and the interplay\nbetween anatomy and anisotropy of the heart. The main objectives are to\ndemonstrate the functional role of the species hearts geometry and anisotropy\non cardiac re-entry anatomy induced drift. In case of the rat pulmonary vein\nwall with ~90 degree transmural fibre rotation, it is shown that the joint\neffect of the PV wall geometry and anisotropy turns a plane excitation wave\ninto a re-entry pinned to a small fluctuation of thickness in the wall.\n",

Here we\nanalysed the \\textit{in-vitro} angiogenic process from the perspective of the\nmonolayer to understand the role of the interaction between the surrounding\nendothelial monolayer, the sprouting and the mechanics. First we noticed that\nthe VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) promotes a jamming/unjamming\ntransition that allows the fluidisation of the monolayer by measuring the shape\nindex factor. Next, we measured the density field over the monolayer and\nrealised that the flow of cells manifests strong similarities with the\nevacuation process where the flock of cells can flow or stuck, defining a\nconvergent channel. Based on these novel observations we propose a mathematical\nmodel to describe the effects of unjamming and reorientation of a flock of\ncells which flow from the monolayer towards the early capillary structure. This\nmodel is developed into the framework of the continuum mechanics in which we\nconsider the endothelial monolayer as an active biopolymer film where the\nnematic order emerges in the unjammed phase promoted by the VEGF activation. To\ntest the proposed ideas we implement the developed coupled equations into a\nfinite element code and describe, with a simplified geometry, the flow effect\nand cells orientation from the monolayer to the capillary. In this work, we\npropose an interpretation, from the top of the endothelial monolayer, based on\nexperimental observations and theoretical arguments to think the angiogenesis.\n",

A comparison of a single capillary configuration (SBC) with two\nparallel cylindrical blood vessels (2 BC) and a lymph vessel parallel to a\nblood vessel (BC_LC) embedded in the tissue cylinder is performed for five\nsolute molecular weights between 0.1 kDa and 70 kDa. We found that the presence\nof a second capillary reduces the extravascular concentration compared to a\nsingle capillary and this reduction is enhanced by the presence of a lymph\nvessel. Co-current flow direction between two adjacent vessels led to\nnonhomogeneous nanoparticle distribution for larger particle sizes in the\ntissue space, while smaller particles (0.1 kDa and 3 kDa) showed the propensity\nto get trapped locally in the tissue during counter-current flow. Varying the\nintercapillary distance with respect to vessel diameter shows a deviation of\n10-30 % concentration for 2 BC and 45-60% concentration for BC_LC configuration\ncompared to the reference SBC configuration. Finally, we introduce a\nnon-dimensional time scale that captures the concertation as a function of the\ntransport and geometric parameters. We find that the peak solute concentration\nin the tissue space occurs at a non-dimensional time, T_peak^* = 0.027+/-0.018,\nirrespective of the solute size, tissue architecture, and microvessel flow\ndirection. This suggests that if indeed such a universal time scale holds, the\nknowledge of this time would allow estimation of the time window at which\nsolute concentration in tissue peaks.

        "summary": "  The variation of blood flow characteristics caused by the probe pressure\nduring noninvasive studies is of particular interest within the context of\nfundamental and applied research. It has been shown previously that the weak\nlocal pressure induces vasodilation, whereas the increased pressure is able to\nstop the blood flow in the compressed area, as well as to significantly change\noptical signals.\n  The blood flow oscillations measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF)\ncharacterize the functional state of the microvascular system and can be used\nfor noninvasive diagnostics of its abnormality. This study was intended to\nidentify the patterns of the relationship between the oscillating components of\nblood flow registered by the LDF method under different levels of pressure\napplied to an optical fiber probe.\n  For this purpose we have developed an original optical probe capable of\nregulating the applied pressure. The developed protocol included six sequential\nrecords of the blood perfusion at pressure within the 0 to 200 mmHg range with\nunloading at the last stage.\n  Using wavelet analyses, we traced the variation of energy of oscillations for\nthese records in five frequency bands associated with different vascular tone\nregulation mechanisms. Six young volunteers of the same age (three males and\nthree females) were included in this preliminary study and the protocol was\nrepeated five times in each volunteer. Totally 30 LDF records were available\nfor the analyses. As expected, the LDF signal increases at weak pressure (30\nmmHg) and decreases at increased pressure. The statistically stable\namplification of endothelial associated blood flow oscillations under the 90\nmmHg pressure allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that the endothelial\nactivity increases. The possible causes of this phenomenon are discussed.\n",

The model extensively covers\ncardiovascular neural pathways including a wide range of afferent sensory\nneurons, central processing by autonomic premotor neurons, efferent outputs via\npreganglionic and postganglionic autonomic neurons and dynamics of\nneurotransmitters at cardiovascular effectors organs. We performed over 500\ncardiovascular experiments using clinical autonomic tests on 72 subjects\nranging from 11 to 82 years old and collected typical cardiovascular signals\nsuch as electrocardiogram, arterial pulse, arterial blood pressure, respiration\npattern, galvanic skin response and skin temperature. After statistical\nevaluation in the time and frequency domains, the data were especially used to\nresolving a constrained optimization task. Results bring evidences supporting\nthe hypothesis that Mayer waves result from a rhythmic sympathetic discharge of\npacemaker-like sympathetic premotor neurons. Simulation also shows that\nvagally-mediated tachycardia, observed during vagal maneuvers on some subjects\ncould be related to the secretion of vasoactive neurotransmitters by the vagal\nnerve. We additionally identified model parameters for estimating the resting\nsympathetic and parasympathetic tone which are believed to be linked to some\npathological states. Results show higher vagal tone on young subjects with a\ndecreasing trend with aging, what agrees with the data from heart rate\nvariability studies. Tonic sympathetic activity was found to possibly emerge\nfrom pacemaker premotor neurons, but also from activation of chemoreceptors to\na lesser extent. The thesis opens perspectives for future work including\nvalidating the markers of autonomic tone provided by our model against data\nfrom experiments with pharmacological blockers and invasive neural activity\nrecordings.\n",

Delayed treatment of the involved\npatients results in collapse of the femoral head, which leads to a need for\ntotal hip arthroplasty surgery. Core decompression, as the most popular\ntechnique for treatment of the osteonecrosis, includes removal of the lesion\narea by drilling a straight tunnel to the lesion, debriding the dead bone and\nreplacing it with bone substitutes. However, there are two drawbacks for this\ntreatment method. First, due to the rigidity of the instruments currently used\nduring core decompression, lesions cannot be completely removed and/or\nexcessive healthy bone may also be removed with the lesion. Second, the use of\nbone substitutes, despite its biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, may not\nprovide sufficient mechanical strength and support for the bone. To address\nthese shortcomings, a novel robot-assisted curved core decompression (CCD)\ntechnique is introduced to provide surgeons with direct access to the lesions\ncausing minimal damage to the healthy bone. In this study, with the aid of\nfinite element (FE) simulations, we investigate biomechanical performance of\ncore decompression using the curved drilling technique in the presence of\nnormal gait loading. In this regard, we compare the result of the CCD using\nbone substitutes and flexible implants with other conventional core\ndecompression techniques. The study finding shows that the maximum principal\nstress occurring at the superior domain of the neck is smaller in the CCD\ntechniques (i.e. 52.847 MPa) compared to the other core decompression methods.\n",

EADs are small voltage\nfluctuations that occur during the plateau of an action potential. Although a\nsingle-cell behavior, EADs can lead to tissue-level arrhythmias, including\nventricular tachycardia. Much is currently known about the biophysical\nmechanisms (i.e., the roles of ion channels and intracellular calcium stores)\nfor EADs, due partially to the development and analysis of mathematical models.\nThis includes the application of slow/fast analysis, which takes advantage of\ntimescale separation inherent in the system to simplify its analysis. We take\nthis further, using a minimal 3D model to demonstrate that the phase-2 EADs are\ncanards that are formed in the neighborhood of a folded node singularity. This\nknowledge allows us to determine the number of EADs that can be produced for a\ngiven parameter set without performing computer simulations, and provides\nguidance on parameter changes that can facilitate or inhibit EAD production.\nWith this approach, we demonstrate why periodic stimulation, as would occur in\nan intact heart, preferentially facilitates EAD production when applied at low\nfrequencies,. We also explain the origin of complex alternan dynamics that can\noccur with intermediate-frequency stimulation, in which varying numbers of EADs\nare produced with each stimulation. These revelations fall out naturally from\nan understanding of folded node singularities, but are hard or impossible to\nglean from a knowledge of the biophysical mechanism for EADs alone. Therefore,\nan understanding of the canard mechanism is a useful complement to an\nunderstanding of the biophysical mechanism that has been developed over years\nof experimental and computational investigations.\n",

Computer simulations of growing\ntissues are employed to study the stability of the interface between two\ntissues on a substrate.

For propagation driven by a difference\nin homeostatic stress, the interface is stable for tissue-specific substrate\nfriction even for very large differences of homeostatic stress; however, it\nbecomes unstable above a critical stress difference when the tissue with the\nlarger homeostatic stress has a higher viscosity. A small difference in\ndirected bulk motility between the two tissues suffices to result in\npropagation with a stable interface, even for otherwise identical tissues.\nLarger differences in motility force, however, result in a finite-wavelength\ninstability of the interface.

The use of CAR T cells to treat B-cell malignancies\n--leukaemias and lymphomas-- is one of the most successful examples, with many\npatients experiencing long-lasting complete responses to this therapy. This\ntreatment works by extracting the patient's T cells and adding them the CAR\ngroup, which enables them to recognize and target cells carrying the antigen\nCD19+, that is expressed in these haematological tumors.\n  Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the time response of\nleukaemias to the injection of CAR T-cells.

An explicit formula is found that provides the maximum CAR T cell\nexpansion in-vivo and the severity of side effects.

        "summary": "  The cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic\nregulator that mediates adaptation to nutritional variations in order to\nmaintain a proper energy balance in cells. We show here that suckling-weaning\nand fasting-refeeding transitions in rodents are associated with changes in\nAMPK activation and the cellular energy state in the liver. These nutritional\ntransitions were characterized by a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose\nutilization, orchestrated by modifications in glucose levels and the\nglucagon:insulin ratio in the bloodstream. We therefore investigated the\nrespective roles of glucose and pancreatic hormones on AMPK activation in mouse\nprimary hepatocytes. We found that glucose starvation transiently activates\nAMPK, whereas changes in glucagon and insulin levels had no impact on AMPK.\nChallenge of hepatocytes with metformin-induced metabolic stress strengthened\nboth AMPK activation and cellular energy depletion limited-glucose conditions,\nwhereas neither glucagon nor insulin altered AMPK activation. Although both\ninsulin and glucagon induced AMPK$\\alpha$ phosphorylation at its Ser-485/491\nresidue, they did not affect its activity. Finally, the decrease in cellular\nATP levels in response to an energy stress was additionally exacerbated under\nfasting conditions and by AMPK deficiency in hepatocytes, revealing metabolic\ninflexibility and emphasizing the importance of AMPK for maintaining hepatic\nenergy charge. Our results suggest that nutritional changes (i.e. glucose\navailability), rather than the related hormonal changes (i.e. the\nglucagon:insulin ratio), sensitize AMPK activation to the energetic stress\ninduced by the dietary transition during fasting. This effect is critical for\npreserving the cellular energy state in the liver.\n",

        "summary": "  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019\nand currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory\nfailure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks\nefficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory\nfailure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike\nprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in\nCOVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified\ntetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating\nlung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene\nexpression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human\nCOVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that\ntwelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515\ncells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues,\nincluding signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as\nTNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these\ntwelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such\nas RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of\ntwelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also\nuniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In\nsummary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms\nleading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and\nCGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.\n",

This study was designed to characterize a\nburn mouse model with tissue-specific insulin resistance under insulin clamp\nconditions. C57BL6/J mice were subjected to 30% full-thickness burn injury and\nunderwent the combination of hyperinsulinemic isoglycemicclamp (HIC) and\npositron emission tomography (PET). Hepatic glucose production (HGP) and\nperipheral glucose disappearance rate (Rd) were measured at different time\npoints up to 7 days post injury. Burned mice showed a significant fasting\nhypoglycemia and hypoinsulinemia (P < 0.01) on post-burn day (PBD) 3 and 7\nalong with significantly higher energy expenditure (P < 0.01). HICon PBD 3\ndemonstrated that burn injury induced systemic insulin resistance, resulting\nfrom a significant decrease in insulin-stimulated Rd (33.0 +/- 10.2 vs 68.3 +/-\n5.9 mg/kg/min; P < 0.05). In contrast, HGP of burned and sham mice was\ncomparable both in the basal and clamp period. PET on PBD 3 showed a lower\ninsulin-stimulated 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in the\nquadriceps of burned mice compared with sham-burned mice. Gastrocnemius muscle\nharvested from burned mice on PBD 3 showed decreased insulin-stimulated\ntyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 to 34.7% of that in\nsham-burn mice by immunoblotting analysis (P < 0.05). These findings suggest\nthat impaired insulin-stimulated Rd in skeletal muscle, not elevated HGP, plays\na role in the development of burn-induced insulin resistance in a mouse model.\n",

Cancer immunotherapies use elements of the patient immune\nsystem to attack tumor cells. One of the most successful types of immunotherapy\nis CAR-T cells. This treatment works by extracting patient's T-cells and adding\nto them an antigen receptor allowing tumor cells to be recognized and targeted.\nThese new cells are called CAR-T cells and are re-infused back into the patient\nafter expansion in-vitro. This approach has been successfully used to treat\nB-cell malignancies (B-cell leukemias and lymphomas). However, its application\nto the treatment of T-cell leukemias faces several problems. One of these is\nfratricide, since the CAR-T cells target both tumor and other CAR-T cells. This\nleads to nonlinear dynamical phenomena amenable to mathematical modeling. In\nthis paper we construct a mathematical model describing the competition of\nCAR-T, tumor and normal T-cells and studied some basic properties of the model\nand its practical implications. Specifically, we found that the model\nreproduced the observed difficulties for in-vitro expansion of the therapeutic\ncells found in the laboratory. The mathematical model predicted that CAR-T cell\nexpansion in the patient would be possible due to the initial presence of a\nlarge number of targets. We also show that, in the context of our mathematical\napproach, CAR-T cells could control tumor growth but not eradicate the disease.\n",

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), is a near\nroom temperature ionized gas composed of reactive species, charged particles,\nneutral particles, and electrons. CAP also has several physical factors\nincluding thermal radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and electromagnetic\n(EM) waves. Most of the previously reported biological effects of CAP have\nrelied on direct contact between bulk plasma and cells, resulting in the\nchemical effects generally seen after CAP treatment. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the electromagnetic emission produced by CAP can lead to the\ndeath of B16F10 melanoma cancer cells via a transbarrier contactless method.\nWhen compared with the effect of reactive species, the effect of the physical\nfactors causes much greater growth inhibition. The physical-triggered growth\ninhibition is due to a new type of cell death, characterized by rapid leakage\nof bulk water from the cells, resulting in bubbles on the cell membrane, and\ncytoplasm shrinkage. The results of this study introduce a new possible\nmechanism of CAP induced cancer cell death and build a foundation for CAP to be\nused as a non-invasive cancer treatment in the future.\n",

The effects of\ndifferent feeding frequencies: one meal per day, two meals per day, three meals\nper day on growth, digestive enzyme activity, feed digestibility and plasma\nbiochemistry were studied in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata, L. 1758) fed\nwith high and low fishmeal and fish oil levels.

No significant effects of feeding frequency on overall performance, feed\nefficiency and feed digestibility during the on-growing of gilthead sea bream\nfed high or low fishmeal and fish oil dietary level were observed. Pepsin\nactivity showed an apparent decrease in fish receiving more than one meal a day\nwhich was not compensated by an increased production of alkaline proteases\nparticularly in fish fed on low FM. Although there were no effects on growth\nand feed utilisation at increasing feeding frequency, trypsin decreased\nsignificantly with an increasing number of meals only under low FMFO diet.\nThus, it seemed that consecutive meals could have amplified the potential\ntrypsin inhibitor effect of the vegetable meal-based diet adopted. Results of\nthe plasma parameters related to nutritional and physiological conditions were\nnot affected by feeding frequency. The higher level of plasma creatinine\ndetected in fish fed a single daily meal with high FMFO level seems to be\nwithin physiological values in relation to the higher protein efficiency\nobserved with this diet. According to the results, gilthead sea bream seems\nable to maximise feed utilisation regardless of the number of meals, and this\ncould be a useful indicator for planning feeding activity at farm level to\noptimise growth of fish and costs of feeding procedures.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper presents a new method for modeling the mechanics of the aortic\nvalve, and simulates its interaction with blood. As much as possible, the model\nconstruction is based on first principles, but such that the model is\nconsistent with experimental observations. We require that tension in the\nleaflets must support a pressure, then derive a system of partial differential\nequations governing its mechanical equilibrium. The solution to these\ndifferential equations is referred to as the predicted loaded configuration; it\nincludes the loaded leaflet geometry, fiber orientations and tensions needed to\nsupport the prescribed load. From this configuration, we derive a reference\nconfiguration and constitutive law. In fluid-structure interaction simulations\nwith the immersed boundary method, the model seals reliably under physiological\npressures, and opens freely over multiple cardiac cycles. Further, model\nclosure is robust to extreme hypo- and hypertensive pressures. Then, exploiting\nthe unique features of this model construction, we conduct experiments on\nreference configurations, constitutive laws, and gross morphology. These\nexperiments suggest the following conclusions, which are directly applicable to\nthe design of prosthetic aortic valves. (i) The loaded geometry, tensions and\ntangent moduli primarily determine model function. (ii) Alterations to the\nreference configuration have little effect if the predicted loaded\nconfiguration is identical. (iii) The leaflets must have sufficiently nonlinear\nmaterial response to function over a variety of pressures. (iv) Valve\nperformance is highly sensitive to free edge length and leaflet height. For\nfuture use, our aortic valve modeling framework offers flexibility in\npatient-specific models of cardiac flow.\n",

        "summary": "  Suction cups are widely used in applications such as in measurement of\nmechanical properties of skin in vivo, in drug delivery devices or in\nacupuncture treatment. Understanding the mechanical response of skin under\nhypobaric pressure are of great importance for users of suction cups. The aims\nof this work are to assess the capability of linear elasticity (Young's\nmodulus) or hyperelasticity in predicting hypobaric pressure induced 3D\nstretching of the skin. Using experiments and computational Finite Element\nMethod modelling, this work demonstrated that although it was possible to\npredict the suction dome apex height using both linear elasticity and\nhyperelasticity for the typical range of hypobaric pressure in medical\napplications (up to -10 psi), linear elasticity theory showed limitations when\npredicting the strain distribution across the suction dome. The reason is that\nthe stretch ratio reaches values exceeding the initial linear elastic stage of\nthe stress-strain characteristic curve for skin. As a result, the linear\nelasticity theory overpredicts the stretch along the rim of domes where there\nis stress concentration. In addition, the modelling showed that the skin was\ncompressed consistently along the thickness direction, leading to reduced\nthickness. Using hyperelasticity modelling to predict the 3D strain\ndistribution paves the way to accurately design safe commercial products that\ninterface with skin.\n",

        "summary": "  In the real world, the severity of traumatic injuries are measured using the\nAbbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However the AIS scale cannot currently be\ncomputed by using finite element human computer models, which calculate a\nmaximum principal strains (MPS). Further, MPS only establishes a threshold\nabove which a serious or fatal injury occurs. In order to overcome these\nlimitations, a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able to calculate the threat to\nlife of any organ injury is proposed. The focus, in this case is on real world\npedestrian brain injuries. The OTM uses a power method, named Peak Virtual\nPower (PVP), and defines brain white and grey matters trauma responses as a\nfunction of impact location and impact speed extracted from the pedestrian\ncollision kinematics. This research has included ageing in the injury severity\ncomputation by including soft tissue material degradation, as well as brain\nvolume changes. Further, to account for the limitations of the Lagrangian\nformulation of the brain model in representing haemorrhage, an approach to\ninclude the effects of subdural hematoma is proposed and included as part of\nthe OTM predictions in this study. The OTM model was tested against three\nreal-life pedestrian accidents and has proven to reasonably predict the Post\nMortem (PM) outcome. Its AIS predictions are closer to the real world injury\nseverity than standard MPS methods currently recommended. This study suggests\nthat the OTM has the potential to improve forensic predictions as well as\ncontribute to the improvement in vehicle safety design through the ability to\nmeasure injury severity. This study concludes that future advances in trauma\ncomputing would require the development of a brain model which could predict\nhaemorrhaging.\n",

The container is filled with a hydrogel, such as a collagen I\nor fibrin gel, while a narrow masking tube is threaded through the ports.\nFollowing gelation, the masking material is pulled out leaving a tunnel within\nthe gel. Seeding of the tunnels with M1 or MDCK renal epithelial cells through\nthe side ports results in a monolayer with apical-basal polarity, such that\nlaminin and fibronectin are present on the basal surface, while primary cilia\nproject from the apical side of cells into the tubular lumen. The device is\noptically accessible, and can be live-imaged by phase contrast or\nepifluorescence microscopy. The lumen of the epithelial-lined tube can be\nconnected through the side ports to a circulatory flow. We demonstrate that\nkidney epithelial cells are able to adjust the diameter of the model tubule by\nmyosin-II dependent contractility. Furthermore, cells of the tubule are also\nable to remodel the surrounding hydrogel leading to budding from the main\ntubule.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Multiple Cox\nproportional hazard regression analysis was performed to determine independent\npredictors of overall survival.

Thrombosis around the VAD inlet cannula (IC) has been highlighted as a\npossible source of stroke events. Recent computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nstudies have attempted to characterize the thrombosis risk of different\nIC-ventricle configurations. However, purely CFD simulations relate thrombosis\nrisk to ad-hoc criteria based on flow characteristics, with little\nconsideration of biochemical factors. This study investigates the genesis of IC\nthrombosis including two elements of the Virchow's triad: Endothelial injury\nand Hypercoagulability. To this end a multi-scale thrombosis simulation that\nincludes platelet activity and coagulation reactions was performed. Our results\nshow significant thrombin formation in stagnation regions (|u|< 0.002 m/s)\nclose to the IC wall. In addition, high shear-mediated platelet activation was\nobserved over the leading-edge tip of the cannula which mirrors the thrombus\ndeposition pattern observed clinically. The current study reveals the\nimportance of biochemical factors to the genesis of thrombosis at the\nventricular-cannula junction which can inform clinical decisions in terms of\nanticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy and guide engineers to develop more robust\ndesigns.\n",

We propose a\nnew method for gene selection in high dimensional data(over 450 thousand).\nVariance filtering is first introduced for dimension reduction and Recursive\nfeature elimination (RFE) is then used for feature selection. We address the\nproblem of selecting a small subsets of genes from large number of methylated\nsites, and our parsimonious model is demonstrated to be efficient, achieving an\naccuracy over 91%, outperforming other studies which use DNA micro-arrays and\nRNA-seq Data .

With the\nrising trend in antibiotic resistance, there is a pressing clinical need for\nnew antimicrobial chemistries and biomaterial design approaches enabling\non-demand activation of antibiotic-free antimicrobial functionality following\nan infection that are environment-friendly, flexible and commercially-viable.\nThis study explores the feasibility of integrating a bioresorbable electrospun\npolymer scaffold with localised antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT)\ncapability. To enable aPDT, we encapsulated a photosensitiser (PS) in polyester\nfibres in the PS inert state, so that the antibacterial function would be\nactivated on-demand via a visible light source. Fibrous scaffolds were\nsuccessfully electrospun from FDA-approved polyesters, either\npoly(epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) or poly[(rac-lactide)-co-glycolide] (PLGA) with\nencapsulated PS (either methylene blue (MB) or erythrosin B (ER)). The\nelectrospun fibres achieved an ~100 wt.% loading efficiency of PS, which\nsignificantly increased their tensile modulus and reduced their average fibre\ndiameter and pore size with respect to PS-free controls. In vitro, PS release\nvaried between a burst release profile to limited release within 100 hours\ndepending on the selected scaffold formulation. Exposure of PS-encapsulated PCL\nfibres to visible light successfully led to at least a 1 log reduction in E.\ncoli viability after 60 minutes of light exposure whereas PS-free electrospun\ncontrols did not inactive microbes.

Regenerative bone scaffolds should ideally mimic aspects of the\ntissue's ECM over multiple length scales and enable surgical handling and\nfixation during implantation in vivo. Leveraging the knowledge gained with\nbioactive self-assembling peptides (SAPs) and SAP-enriched electrospun fibres,\nwe presented a cell free approach for promoting mineralisation via apatite\ndeposition and crystal growth, in vitro, of SAP-enriched nonwoven scaffolds.\nThe nonwoven scaffold was made by electrospinning poly(epsilon-caprolactone)\n(PCL) in the presence of either peptide P11-4 (Ac-QQRFEWEFEQQ-Am) or P11-8\n(Ac-QQRFOWOFEQQ-Am), in light of the polymer's fibre forming capability and its\nhydrolytic degradability as well as the well-known apatite nucleating\ncapability of SAPs. The 11-residue family of peptides (P11-X) has the ability\nto self-assemble into beta-sheet ordered structures at the nano-scale and to\ngenerate hydrogels at the macroscopic scale, some of which are capable of\npromoting biomineralisation due to their apatite-nucleating capability. Both\nvariants of SAP-enriched nonwoven used in this study were proven to be\nbiocompatible with murine fibroblasts and supported nucleation and growth of\napatite minerals in simulated body fluid (SBF) in vitro. The fibrous nonwoven\nprovided a structurally robust scaffold, with the capability to control SAP\nrelease behaviour. Up to 75% of P11-4 and 45% of P11-8 were retained in the\nfibres after 7-day incubation in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. The encapsulation\nof SAP in a nonwoven system with apatite-forming as well as localised and\nlong-term SAP delivery capabilities is appealing as a potential means of\nachieving cost-effective bone repair therapy for critical size defects.\n",

        "summary": "  While tooth root resorption is a normal physiological process required for\nresorption and exfoliation of primary teeth, root resorption of adult teeth is\nlargely pathological. This perspective focuses on multiple idiopathic cervical\nroot resorption (MICRR), an aggressive form of external root resorption that\noccurs near the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). The cause of MICRR remains\nelusive, however, it is mediated primarily by osteoclasts/odontoclasts.\nAccumulating case studies and experiments in animal models have provided\ninsights into defining the etiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms for\nMICRR, which include: systemic conditions and syndromes, inherited genetic\nvariants affecting osteoclast/odontoclast activity, altered periodontal\nstructures, drug-induced root resorption and rebound effects after cessation of\nanti-resorptive treatment, chemotherapy, exposure to pets or viral infections,\nand other factors such as inflammatory conditions or trauma. To determine the\ncausative factors, at minimum, a comprehensive health history should be\ncollected for all patients by dental care providers, discussed with other\nhealth care providers and appropriate collaborations established. The examples\nhighlighted in this perspective emphasize the need for transdisciplinary\nresearch collaborations coupled with integrated management strategies between\nmedicine and dentistry in order to identify cause(s) early and improve clinical\noutcomes.\n",

These studies\nhold great promise for finding co-targetable hub/pathways which in turn would\ncontrol the downstream non-genetic mechanisms of adaptive resistance. Many such\nmechanisms have been described in the paradigmatic BRAF-mutated melanoma model\nof adaptive response to BRAF inhibition. Currently, a major challenge for these\nmechanistic studies is to confirm in vivo, at the single-cell proteomic level,\nthe existence of dependencies between the co-targeted hub/pathways and their\ndownstream effectors. Moreover, the drug-induced in vivo modulation of these\ndependencies needs to be demonstrated. Here, we implement such\nsingle-cell-based in vivo expression dependency quantification using\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC)-based analyses of sequential biopsies in two\nxenograft models. These mimic phase 2 and 3 trials in our own therapeutic\nstrategy to prevent the adaptive response to BRAF inhibition. In this\nmechanistic model, the dependencies between the targeted Li2CO3-inducible hub\nHuR and the resistance effectors are more likely time-shifted and transient\nsince the minority of HuRLow cells, which act as a reservoir of adaptive\nplasticity, switch to a HuRHigh state as they paradoxically proliferate under\nBRAF inhibition. Nevertheless, we show that a copula/kernel density estimator\n(KDE)-based quantification of mutual information (MI) efficiently captures, at\nthe individual level, the dependencies between HuR and two relevant resistance\nmarkers pERK and EGFR, and outperforms classic expression correlation\ncoefficients. Ultimately, the validation of MI as a predictive IHC-based metric\nof response to our therapeutic strategy will be carried in clinical trials.\n",

Additionally, the model includes erosion of the extracellular\nmatrix, interstitial flow, and coupled flow in blood vessels and tissue. We\nemploy continuum mixture theory with stochastic Cahn--Hilliard type phase-field\nmodels of tumor growth. The interstitial flow is governed by a mesoscale\nversion of Darcy's law. The flow in the blood vessels is controlled by\nPoiseuille flow, and Starling's law is applied to model the mass transfer in\nand out of blood vessels. The evolution of the network of blood vessels is\norchestrated by the concentration of the tumor angiogenesis factors (TAFs);\nblood vessels grow towards the increasing TAFs concentrations. This process is\nnot deterministic, allowing random growth of blood vessels and, therefore, due\nto the coupling of nutrients in tissue and vessels, makes the growth of tumors\nstochastic. We demonstrate the performance of the model by applying it to a\nvariety of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility of the\nmodel and its ability to generate satellite tumors.

The scaffolds were 3D-printed\nusing a mixture of PCL, MBG and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) particles,\nsubsequently leached out. Microporous-PCL (pPCL) as a negative control,\nmicroporous MBG-PCL (pMBG-PCL) and non-microporous-MBG-PCL (MBG-PCL) were\ninvestigated. Scanning electron microscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry and\nmicro-computed tomography demonstrated that the PBS removal resulted in the\nformation of micropores inside the struts with porosity of around 30% for both\npPCL and pMBG-PCL, with both constructs displaying an overall porosity of\n80-90%. In contrast, the MBG-PCL group had a microporosity of 6% and an overall\nporosity of 70%. Early mineralisation was found in the pMBG-PCL post-leaching\nout and this resulted in the formation a more homogeneous calcium phosphate\nlayer when using a biomimetic mineralisation assay. Mechanical properties\nranged from 5 to 25 MPa for microporous and non-microporous specimens, hence\nmicroporosity was the determining factor affecting compressive properties.\nMC3T3-E1 metabolic activity was increased in the pMBG-PCL along with an\nincreased production of RUNX2. Therefore, the microporosity within a 3D-printed\nbioceramic composite construct may result in additional physical and biological\nbenefits.\n",

This study aims to determine\nwhether performing a short intraoperative time out can improve CVS\nimplementation. Methods: Surgeons performing LCs at an academic centre were\ninvited to perform a 5-second long time out to verify CVS before dividing the\ncystic duct (5-second rule). The primary endpoint was to compare the rate of\nCVS achievement between LCs performed in the year before and the year after the\n5-second rule. The CVS achievement rate was computed using the mediated\nvideo-based assessment of two independent reviewers. Clinical outcomes, LC\nworkflows, and postoperative reports were also compared. Results: Three hundred\nand forty-three (171 before and 172 after the 5-second rule) of the 381 LCs\nperformed over the 2-year study were analysed. After the implementation of the\n5-second rule, the rate of CVS achievement increased significantly (15.9 vs\n44.1 %; P<0.001) as well as the rate of bailout procedures (8.2 vs 15.7 %;\nP=0.045), the median time to clip the cystic duct or artery (17:26\n[interquartile range: 16:46] vs 23:12 [17:16] minutes; P=0.007), and the rate\nof postoperative CVS reporting (1.3 vs 28.8 %; P<0.001). Morbidity was\ncomparable (1.75 vs 2.33 % before and after the 5-second rule respectively;\nP=0.685). Conclusion: Performing a short intraoperative time out improves CVS\nimplementation during LC. Systematic intraoperative cognitive aids should be\nstudied to sustain the uptake of guidelines.\n",

Looking for\nthis capacity, in this study three porous glasses were synthesized and\ncharacterized. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration\nof the glass particles that, being out of the cytotoxic range, could increase\nVEGF secretion. The viability of cultivated bone marrow stromal cells (ST-2)\nwas assessed. The samples were examined with light microscopy (LM) after the\nhistochemical staining for haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The biological activity\nof glasses was evaluated in terms of the influence of the Cu2+ and Sr2+ ions on\nthe cells. The dissolution products of CuSr-1 and CuSr-2.5 produced the highest\nsecretion of VEGF from ST-2 cells after 48 h of incubation. The combination of\nCu2+ and Sr2+ lays the foundation for engineering a bioactive glass than can\nlead to vascularized, functional bone tissue when used in bone regeneration\napplications.\n",

        "summary": "  Novel materials, based on Mesoporous Bioactive Glasses (MBGs) in the ternary\nsystem SiO2-CaO-P2O5, decorated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and\nsubsequently with amino acid Lysine (Lys), by post-grafting method on the\nexternal surface of the glasses (named MBG-NH2 and MBG-Lys), are reported. The\nsurface functionalization with organic groups did not damage the mesoporous\nnetwork and their structural and textural properties were also preserved\ndespite the high solubility of MBG matrices. The incorporation of Lys confers a\nzwitterionic nature to these MBG materials due to the presence of adjacent\namine and carboxylic groups in the external surface. At physiologic pH, this\ncoexistence of basic amine and carboxilic acid groups from anchored Lys\nprovided zero surface charge named zwitterionic effect. This behaviour could\ngive rise to potential applications of antibacterial adhesion. Therefore, in\norder to assess the influence of zwitterionic nature in in vitro bacterial\nadhesion, studies were carried out with Staphylococcus aureus. It was\ndemonstrated that the efficient interaction of these zwitterionic pairs onto\nthe MBG surfaces reduced bacterial adhesion up to 99.9% compared to bare MBGs.\nIn order to test the suitability of zwitterionic MBGs materials as bone grafts,\ntheir cytocompatibility was investigated in vitro with MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts.\nThese findings suggested that the proposed surface functionalization strategy\nprovided MBG materials with notable antibacterial adhesion properties, hence\nmaking these materials promising candidates for local bone infection therapy.\n",

To explain our observations we put forward\nincreasingly complex biologically-inspired mathematical models that captured\nthe key processes governing tumor growth.

The system was used in this study to co-deliver two different cargos:\nsiRNA and daunorubicin. Anti-TWIST siRNA plays critical role in modulating\nknockdown of TWIST and sensitizing cells to chemotherapeutics such as\ndaunorubicin for ovarian cancer therapy. The drug was released in response to\nexternally controlled oscillating magnetic fields (OMF). siRNA (siGFP) silenced\nexpression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) in Ovcar8 cancer cells,\ndemonstrating the incorporation of core shell MSNPs into cells and siGFP\ndelivery. The synergistic effect of the co-release of anti-TWIST-siRNA loaded\nin the PEI and daunorubicin loaded in NPs pores c aused increased cytotoxicity\nin Ovcar8 of up to 50% from both zwitteronic and non-zwitteronic NPs. The\nsystem is the first example of silencing by anti-TWITS-siRNA /daunorubicin\nco-delivered using zwitterionic core-shell nanoparticles with low-fouling\nadsorption.

        "summary": "  The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulatory capacity begins before birth as\nthe sympathetic and parasympathetic activity contributes significantly to the\nfetus' development. Several studies have shown how vagus nerve is involved in\nmany vital processes during fetal, perinatal and postnatal life: from the\nregulation of inflammation through the anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway,\nwhich may affect the functioning of each organ, to the production of hormones\ninvolved in bioenergetic metabolism. In addition, the vagus nerve has been\nrecognized as the primary afferent pathway capable of transmitting information\nto the brain from every organ of the body. Therefore, this hypothesis paper\naims to review the development of ANS during fetal and perinatal life, focusing\nparticularly on the vagus nerve, to identify possible \"critical windows\" that\ncould impact its maturation. These \"critical windows\" could help clinicians\nknow when to monitor fetuses to effectively assess the developmental status of\nboth ANS and specifically the vagus nerve. In addition, this paper will focus\non which factors (i.e. fetal characteristics and behaviors, maternal lifestyle\nand pathologies, placental health and dysfunction, labor, incubator conditions,\nand drug exposure) may have an impact on the development of the vagus during\nthe above-mentioned \"critical window\" and how. This analysis could help\nclinicians and stakeholders define precise guidelines for improving the\nmanagement of fetuses and newborns, particularly to reduce the potential\nadverse environmental impacts on ANS development that may lead to persistent\nlong-term consequences. Since the development of ANS and the vagus influence\nhave been shown to be reflected in cardiac variability, this paper will rely in\nparticular on studies using fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) to monitor the\ncontinued growth and health of both animal and human fetuses.\n",

While the\nterm was introduced in the 18th century by the philosopher Immanuel Kant to\ndescribe the goal-directed properties of living systems, it came into modern\nuse for non-living materials in which complex forms and patterns emerge through\ndynamical, energy-expending physical processes. What is the relationship among\nthese uses of the term? While multicellular forms arose dozens of times from\nsingle-celled organisms, only some of these undergo development, and not all\ndevelopmental processes are self-organizing. The evolution of the animals\n(metazoans) from unicellular holozoans was accompanied by the addition of novel\ngene products which mediated the constitution the resulting cell clusters as\nliquid-, liquid crystal-, and solid-like materials with versatile morphogenetic\npropensities. Such materials variously exhibited multilayering, lumen formation\nand elongation, echoing the self-organizing properties of nonliving matter,\n\"generic\" based on such parallels, though with biologically based subunit\nproperties and modes of interaction. These effects provided evolutionary\ntemplates for embryonic forms and morphological motifs of metazoan lineages.\nEmbryos and organ primordia of present-day animal species continue to generate\nforms that resemble the outcomes of these physical effects.

Patients with bicuspid valves frequently develop\ndilation and aneurysms of the ascending aorta. Both hemodynamic and genetic\nfactors are believed to contribute to dilation, yet the precise mechanism\nunderlying this progression remains under debate. Controlled comparisons of\nhemodynamics in patients with different forms of bicuspid valve disease are\nchallenging because of confounding factors, and simulations offer the\nopportunity for direct and systematic comparisons. Using fluid-structure\ninteraction simulations, we simulate flows through multiple aortic valve models\nin a patient-specific geometry. The aortic geometry is based on a healthy\npatient with no known aortic or valvular disease, which allows us to isolate\nthe hemodynamic consequences of changes to the valve alone. Four fully-passive,\nelastic model valves are studied: a tricuspid valve and bicuspid valves with\nfusion of the left- and right-, right- and non-, and non- and left-coronary\ncusps. The resulting tricuspid flow is relatively uniform, with little\nsecondary or reverse flow, and little to no pressure gradient across the valve.\nThe bicuspid cases show localized jets of forward flow, excess streamwise\nmomentum, elevated secondary and reverse flow, and clinically significant\nlevels of stenosis. Localized high flow rates correspond to locations of\ndilation observed in patients, with the location related to which valve cusps\nare fused. Thus, the simulations support the hypothesis that chronic exposure\nto high local flow contributes to localized dilation and aneurysm formation.\n",

This comparative study demonstrates that\nparticles of mesoporous bioactive glass MBG-75S and mesoporous nanospheres\nNanoMBG-75S allow the appropriated development and function of RAW 264.7 and\nJ774A.1 macrophages and do not induce polarization towards the M1\npro-inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, considering that these mesoporous\nbiomaterials offer the possibility of loading drugs into their pores, the\nresults obtained indicate their high potential for use as drug-delivery systems\nin bone repair and osteoporosis treatments without triggering an adverse\ninflammatory response.\n",

There is an unmet need for effective therapeutic strategies that\ncontrol and inhibit the growth of these biofilms. Herein, light sensitive\nmesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with photothermal (PTT) and\nantimicrobial combined capabilities have been developed. These nanosystems have\nhigh therapeutic potential to affect the bacterial biofilm architecture and\nsubsequently inhibit its growth. Nucleation of gold nanorods followed by the\ngrowth of a silica shell leads to a core@shell design (AuNR@MSN) with PTT\nproperties. Incorporation of nitrosothiol groups (-SNO) with a heat liable\nlinker, enables an enhanced nitric oxide release upon photothermal stimulation\nwith near infrared radiation. Further loading of an antimicrobial molecule such\nas the levofloxacin (LEVO) antibiotic creates a unique nanoassembly with\npotential therapeutic efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus bacterial\nbiofilms. A dispersion rate of the bacterial biofilm was evident when light\nstimuli is applied because impregnation of the nitrosothiol functionalized\nnanosystem with the antibiotic LEVO led to ca. 30% reduction but its\nillumination with near infrared (NIR) irradiation showed a biofilm reduction of\nca. 90%, indicating that localized antimicrobial exposure and PTT improves the\ntherapeutic efficacy. These findings envision the conception of\nnear-infraredactivated nanoparticle carriers capable of combined therapy upon\nNIR irradiation, which enables photothermal therapy, together with the release\nof levofloxacin and nitric oxide to disrupt the integrity of bacterial biofilms\nand achieve a potent antimicrobial therapy.\n",

We demonstrated that the mathematical model could replicate\nphysiological responses in burn patients associated with wide demographic\ncharacteristics and injury severity and that an increased inflammatory response\nto injury may be a key contributing factor in increasing the mortality risk of\nolder patients and patients with inhalation injury via an increase in the fluid\nretention.

This study aimed to\nevaluate growth performance, feed utilisation, nutrient apparent digestibility,\nand N losses to the environment in seabream juveniles reared under low\ntemperature (13 degrees Celsius). Three isolipid and isoenergetic diets were\nformulated: a commercial-like diet (COM) with 44% crude protein and 27.5%\nfishmeal; and 2 diets with 42% CP (ECO and ECOSup), reduced FM inclusion, and\n15% poultry meal. ECOSup diet was supplemented with a mix of feed additives\nintended to promote fish growth and feed intake. The ECO diets presented lower\nproduction costs than the COM diet and included more sustainable ingredients.\nSeabream juveniles (154.5 g) were randomly assigned to triplicate tanks and fed\nthe diets for 84 days. Fish fed the ECOSup and COM diets attained a similar\nfinal body weight. ECOSup fed fish presented significantly higher HSI than COM\nfed fish, probably due to higher hepatic glycogen reserves. The VSI of ECOSup\nfed fish were significantly lower compared to COM fed fish, which is a positive\nachievement from a consumer point of view. Nutrient digestibility was similar\nin ECOSup and COM diets. Feeding fish with the ECO diets resulted in lower\nfaecal N losses when compared to COM fed fish. Feeding seabream with an\neco-friendly diet with a mix of feed additives promoted growth, improved fish\nnutritional status and minimised N losses to the environment whilst lowering\nproduction costs. Nutritional strategies that ultimately promote feed intake\nand diet utilisation are valuable tools that may help conditioning fish to\nsustain growth even under adverse conditions.\n",

This finding supports the existence of\nan electrical pathway, specialized in transmitting high-frequency sounds that\nworks in unison with the mechanical pathway. A bio-organic triode, similar to a\nfield effect transistor, is the key mechanism of our hypothesized pathway. We\npresent evidence that any deficiency along this pathway produces hearing\nimpairment.

        "summary": "  Atrioventricular valve regurgitation is a significant cause of morbidity and\nmortality in patients with acquired and congenital cardiac valve disease.\nImage-derived computational modeling of atrioventricular valves has advanced\nsubstantially over the last decade and holds particular promise to inform valve\nrepair in small and heterogeneous populations which are less likely to be\noptimized through empiric clinical application. While an abundance of\ncomputational biomechanics studies have investigated mitral and tricuspid valve\ndisease in adults, few studies have investigated application to vulnerable\npediatric and congenital heart populations. Further, to date, investigators\nhave primarily relied upon a series of commercial applications that are neither\ndesigned for image-derived modeling of cardiac valves, nor freely available to\nfacilitate transparent and reproducible valve science. To address this\ndeficiency, we aimed to build an open-source computational framework for the\nimage-derived biomechanical analysis of atrioventricular valves. In the present\nwork, we integrated an open-source valve modeling platform, SlicerHeart, and an\nopen-source biomechanics finite element modeling software, FEBio, to facilitate\nimage-derived atrioventricular valve model creation and finite element\nanalysis. We present a detailed verification and sensitivity analysis to\ndemonstrate the fidelity of this modeling in application to 3D\nechocardiography-derived pediatric mitral and tricuspid valve models. Our\nanalyses achieved excellent agreement with those reported in the literature. As\nsuch, this evolving computational framework offers a promising initial\nfoundation for future development and investigation of valve mechanics, in\nparticular collaborative efforts targeting the development of improved repairs\nfor children with congenital heart disease.\n",

A fenestration is a shunt between the systemic and pulmonary veins\nthat is added either at the time of Fontan conversion or at a later time for\nthe treatment of complications. This shunt increases cardiac output and\ndecreases systemic venous pressure. However, these hemodynamic benefits are\nachieved at the expense of a decrease in the arterial oxygen saturation. The\nmodel developed this paper incorporates fenestration size as a parameter and\ndescribes both blood flow and oxygen transport. It is calibrated to clinical\ndata from Fontan patients, and we use it to study the impact of a fenestration\non several hemodynamic variables. In certain scenarios corresponding to\nhigh-risk Fontan physiology, we demonstrate the existence of an optimal\nfenestration size that maximizes oxygen delivery to the systemic tissues.\n",

Hypoxia-induced\n(type 3) pulmonary hypertension can be studied in animals exposed to a low\noxygen environment for prolonged time periods leading to biomechanical\nalterations in vessel wall structure. This study formulates and systematically\nreduces a nonlinear elastic structural wall model for a large pulmonary artery,\ngenerating a novel pressure-area relation capturing remodeling in type 3\npulmonary hypertension. The model is calibrated using {\\em ex vivo}\nmeasurements of vessel diameter and wall thickness changes, under controlled\nflow conditions, in left pulmonary arteries isolated from control and\nhypertensive mice. A two-layer, hyperelastic, anisotropic model incorporating\nresidual stresses is formulated using the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden model. Complex\nrelations predicting vessel area and wall thickness with increasing blood\npressure are derived and calibrated using the data. Sensitivity analysis,\nparameter estimation and subset selection are used to systematically reduce the\n16-parameter model to one in which a much smaller subset of identifiable\nparameters is estimated via solution of an inverse problem. Our final reduced\nmodel includes a single set of three elastic moduli. Estimated ranges of these\nparameters demonstrate that nonlinear stiffening is dominated by elastin in the\ncontrol animals and by collagen in the hypertensive group. The novel\npressure-area relation developed in this study has potential impact on\none-dimensional fluids network models of vessel wall remodeling in the presence\nof cardiovascular disease.\n",

However, the role of interactions between the growing vasculature and\nits environment remains largely unresolved, particularly concerning mechanical\neffects. Motivated by this gap in understanding, we develop a computational\nframework that is tailored to exploring the role of the mechanical environment\non the formation of vascular networks.

In our explorations, we demonstrate that such a model\ncan successfully reproduce familiar network structures, whilst highlighting the\nroles that mechanical influences could play in vascular development. For\ninstance, we illustrate how an external substrate could act as an effective\nshared memory for the periodic regrowth of vasculature.

The growth of maize roots\njust emerging from a corseting agarose gel and contacting a force sensor\n(acting as an obstacle) was monitored by time-lapse imaging simultaneously to\nthe force.\n  The evolution of the velocity field along the root was obtained from\nkinematics analysis of the root texture with a PIV derived-technique. A\ntriangular fit was introduced to retrieve the elemental elongation rate or\nstrain rate. A parameter-free model based on the Lockhart law quantitatively\npredicts how the force at the obstacle modifies several features of the growth\ndistribution (length of the growth zone, maximal elemental elongation rate,\nvelocity) during the first 10 minutes.

The literature search\nencompassed MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar from 1990 to 2022. Results. The\nliterature search identified 12 antihistamines with activity against different\npathogens. Eight molecules were second-generation antihistamines with\nintrinsically lower tendency to cross the blood brain barrier thereby with\nreduced side effects. Only five antihistamines had in vivo evaluations in\nrodents while one study utilized a wax moth model to determine astemizole\nanti-Cryptococcus sp. activity combined with fluconazole. In vitro studies\nshowed that clemastine was active against Plasmodium, Leishmania, and\nTrypanosoma, while terfenadine suppressed Candida spp. and Staphylococcus\naureus growth. In vitro assays found that SARS-coV-2 was inhibited by doxepin,\nazelastine, desloratadine, and clemastine. Different antihistamines inhibited\nEbola virus (diphenhydramine, chlorcyclizine), Hepatitis C virus\n(chlorcyclizine), and Influenza virus (carbinoxamine, chlorpheniramine).\nGenerally, in vitro activity (IC50) of antihistamines was in the low to\nsub-microM range, except for Staphylococcus epidermidis (loratadine MIC=50\nmicroM) and SARS-coV-2 (desloratadine 70% inhibition at 20 microM). Conclusion.\nMany antihistamine drugs showed potential to progress to clinical trials based\non in vitro data and availability of toxicological and pharmacological data.\nHowever, the overall lack of systematic preclinical trials has hampered the\nadvance of repurposed antihistamines for off label evaluation.

In this study we report, for the first time, the role of noisy\ncircumnutations in facilitating an optimal growth pattern within a crowded\ngroup of mutually shading plants. We revisit the problem of self-organization\nobserved for sunflowers, mediated by shade response interactions. Our analysis\nreveals that circumnutation movements conform to a bounded random walk\ncharacterized by a remarkably broad distribution of velocities, covering three\norders of magnitude. In motile animal systems such wide distributions of\nmovement velocities are frequently identified with enhancement of behavioral\nprocesses, suggesting that circumnutations may serve as a source of functional\nnoise. To test our hypothesis, we developed a parsimonious model of interacting\ngrowing disks, informed by experiments, successfully capturing the\ncharacteristic dynamics of individual and multiple interacting plants.\nEmploying our simulation framework we examine the role of circumnutations in\nthe system, and find that the observed breadth of the velocity distribution\nconfers advantageous effects by facilitating exploration of potential\nconfigurations, leading to an optimized arrangement with minimal shading. These\nfindings represent the first report of functional noise in plant movements, and\nestablishes a theoretical foundation for investigating how plants navigate\ntheir environment by employing computational processes such as task-oriented\nprocesses, optimization, and active sensing.\n",

We present results gained\nwith in vitro expression systems, gene targeted animal models and the iPSC\ntechnology, highlighting advantages, limits and pitfalls for each of these\nsystems.\n  Overall, the results obtained in the last two decades confirm that the\ninitial pathological mechanism of epileptogenic SCN1A/NaV1.1 mutations is\nloss-of-function of NaV1.1 leading to hypoexcitability of at least some types\nof GABAergic neurons (including cortical and hippocampal parvalbumin- and\nsomatostatin-positive ones). Conversely, more limited results point to NaV1.1\ngain-of-function for FHM mutations. Behind these relatively simple pathological\nmechanisms, an unexpected complexity has been observed, in part generated by\ntechnical issues in experimental studies and in part related to intrinsically\ncomplex pathophysiological responses and remodeling, which yet remain to be\nfully disentangled.\n",

The valve is composed of leaflets\nattached to a ring, the free edges of which are supported by a system of\nchordae, which themselves are anchored to muscles inside the heart. First, we\nexamine valve anatomy and show the results of original dissections. These\ndisplay the gross anatomy and information on fiber structure of the mitral\nvalve. Next, we build a model valve following a design-based approach to\nelasticity. We incorporate information from the dissections to specify the\nfiber topology of this model. We assume the valve achieves mechanical\nequilibrium while supporting a static pressure load. The solution to the\nresulting differential equations determines the pressurized configuration of\nthe valve model. To complete the model we then specify a constitutive law based\non experimental stress-strain relations from the literature. Finally, using the\nimmersed boundary method, we simulate the model valve in fluid in a computer\ntest chamber. The aim of this work is to determine the basic principles and\nmechanisms underlying the anatomy and function of the mitral valve.\n",

Scar\nformation is generally considered as a barrier for regeneration in central\nnervous system (CNS), while the intrinsic mechanism of scar-forming after\nspinal cord injury has not been completed deciphered. Methods: We assessed\ncholesterol hemostasis in spinal cord lesions and injured peripheral nerves\nusing confocal reflection microscopy and real-time PCR analyses. The\ninvolvement of the proteins, which were predicted to promote cholesterol efflux\nin spinal cord lesions, were assessed with Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist and\nApolipoprotein E (APOE) deficiency. The role of reverse cholesterol transport\n(RCT) in cholesterol clearance was examined in APOE KO mice injured sciatic\nnerves and myelin-overloaded macrophages in vitro. Finally, we determined the\nconsequence of excess cholesterol accumulation in CNS by transplantation of\nmyelin into neonatal spinal cord lesions. Results: We found that excess\ncholesterol accumulates in phagocytes and is inefficiently removed in spinal\ncord lesions in young-adult mice. Interestingly, we observed that excessive\ncholesterol also accumulates in injured peripheral nerves, but is subsequently\nremoved by RCT. Meanwhile, preventing RCT led to macrophage accumulation and\nfibrosis in injured peripheral nerves. Furthermore, the neonatal mouse spinal\ncord lesions are devoid of myelin-derived lipids, and able to heal without\nexcess cholesterol accumulation. We found that transplantation of myelin into\nneonatal lesions disrupts healing with excessive cholesterol accumulation,\npersistent macrophage activation and fibrosis, indicating myelin-derived\ncholesterol plays a critical role in impaired wound healing.\n",

We simulate dynamics using differential equations examining the\nresponse to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. The model tracks pro- and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-$\\alpha$, IL-6, IL-10), concentrations of\ncorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and\ncortisol in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Daily hormonal\nvariations are integrated into the model by including circadian oscillations\nwhen tracking CRH. Additionally, the model tracks heart rate, blood pressure,\nbody temperature, and pain perception. Studied quantities function on\ntimescales ranging from minutes to days. To understand how endotoxin impacts\nthe body over this vast span of timescales, we examine the response to\nvariations in LPS administration methods (single dose, repeated dose, and\ncontinuous dose) as well as the timing of the administration and the amount of\nendotoxin released into the system. We calibrate the model to literature data\nfor a 2 ng/kg LPS bolus injection. Results show that LPS administration during\nearly morning or late evening generates a more pronounced hormonal response.\nMost of the LPS effects are eliminated from the body 24 hours after\nadministration, the main impact of inflammation remains in the system for 48\nhours, and repeated dose simulations show that residual effects remain more\nthan 10 days after the initial injection. We also show that if the LPS\nadministration method or total dosage is increased, the system response is\namplified, posing a greater risk of hypotension and pyrexia.\n",

At higher levels of applied strain however, adaptive stretching\nsuffers from decorrelation noise and the image quality deteriorates\nsignificantly. Reducing the size of correlation windows have previously showed\nto enhance the performance in a speckle tracking algorithm but a correlation\nfilter was required to prevent peak hopping errors. In this paper, we present a\nnovel strain estimation algorithm which utilizes an array of overlapping short\nterm cross correlation kernels which are about one-fourth the size of a typical\nlarge kernel, to implement an adaptive stretching algorithm. Our method does\nnot require any supplementary correlation filter to prevent false peak errors.\nAdditionally, a lateral search is incorporated using 1.5D algorithm to account\nfor the mechanically induced lateral shift. To validate the efficacy of our\nproposed method we analyzed the results using simulation and in-vivo data of\nbreast tumors. Our proposed method demonstrated a superior performance compared\nto classical adaptive stretching algorithm in both qualitative and quantitative\nassessment.

Metabolism, in turn, relies on the delivery of metabolites and\nremoval of toxic byproducts through diffusion processes and the cerebral blood\nflow. A comprehensive mathematical model of brain metabolism should account not\nonly for the biochemical processes and the interaction of neurons and\nastrocytes, but also the diffusion of metabolites. In the present article, we\npresent a computational methodology based on a multidomain model of the brain\ntissue and a homogenization argument for the diffusion processes. In our\nspatially distributed compartment model, communication between compartments\noccur both through local transport fluxes, as is the case within local\nastrocyte-neuron complexes, and through diffusion of some substances in some of\nthe compartments. The model assumes that diffusion takes place in the\nextracellular space (ECS) and in the astrocyte compartment. In the astrocyte\ncompartment, the diffusion across the syncytium network is implemented as a\nfunction of gap junction strength. The diffusion process is implemented\nnumerically by means of a finite element method (FEM) based spatial\ndiscretization, and robust stiff solvers are used to time integrate the\nresulting large system. Computed experiments show the effects of ECS\ntortuosity, gap junction strength and spatial anisotropy in the astrocyte\nnetwork on the brain energy metabolism.\n",

Meta-analysis results\nshowed that the combined sensitivity(SE), specificity(SP), positive likelihood\nratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and\npositive posterior probability (PPP) of ECS screening for early EC were\n0.95[95%CI: 0.84, 0.98], 0.92 [95%CI: 0.83, 0.96], 11.8 [95%CI: 5.3, 26.1],\n0.06 [95%CI: 0.02, 0.18], 203 [95%CI: 50, 816], and 75%, respectively. The area\n(AUC) under the receiver Operating Characteristic curve (SROC) was 0.98[95%CI:\n0.96, 0.99]. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that ECS can be used as an\neffective screening tool for early EC. Due to the limited number and quality of\nincluded studies, it is imperative to conduct more high-quality studies to\nverify the above conclusions.\n",

Gas bubbles are formed during freezing and expand\nduring thawing resulting in xylem embolism. However, when water freezes, its\nvolume increases by 9%, generating local pressures, which can affect the\nformation of bubbles. To characterize local dynamic of pressure-tension and\nphysical state of the sap during freeze-thaw cycles, we simultaneously used\nultrasonic acoustic emissions analysis and synchrotron-based high resolution\ncomputed tomography on the diffuse-porous species Betula pendula. Visualization\nof individual air-filled vessels was performed to measure freeze-thaw induced\nembolism after successive freeze-thaw cycles down to -10{\\deg}C or -20{\\deg}C\nduring the leafy and the leafless periods. We also measured the distribution of\ngas bubbles in frozen xylem of Betula pendula, and made additional continuous\nmonitoring of embolism spreading during one freeze-thaw cycle using a dedicated\ncooling system that allowed X-ray scanning during freezing and thawing.\nExperiments confirmed that ultrasonic emissions occurred after the onset of ice\nformation, together with bubble formation, whereas the development of embolism\ntook place after thawing in all cases. The pictures of frozen tissues indicated\nthat the positive pressure induced by the volumetric increase of ice can\nprovoke inward flow from the cell wall toward the lumen of the vessels. We\nfound no evidence that wider vessels within a tissue were more prone to\nembolism although the occurrence of gas bubbles in larger conduits would make\nthem prone to earlier embolism. These results highlight the need to monitor\nlocal pressure as well as ice and air distribution during xylem freezing to\nunderstand the mechanism leading to frost-induced embolism.\n",

While guidelines exist, there\nis no reliable way to quantitatively assess the degree of IRI present in the\nliver. Our recent study has shown a correlation between the bile-to-plasma\nratio of FDA-approved sodium fluorescein (SF) and the degree of hepatic IRI,\npresumably due to IRI-induced decrease in the activity of the hepatic multidrug\nresistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2); however, the contribution of SF blood\nclearance via the bile is still convoluted with other factors, such as renal\nclearance. In this work, we sought to computationally model SF blood clearance\nvia the bile. First, we converted extant SF fluorescence data from rat whole\nblood, plasma, and bile to concentrations using calibration curves. Next, based\non these SF concentration data, we generated a liver-centric,\nphysiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of SF liver uptake and\nclearance via the bile. Model simulations show that SF bile concentration is\nhighly sensitive to a change in the activity of hepatic MPR2. These simulations\nsuggest that SF bile clearance along with the PBPK model can be used to\nquantify the effect of IRI on the activity of MRP2.\n",

We hypothesised that a theranostic dressing could be\nrealised by integrating a collagen-based wound contact layer with previously\ndemonstrated wound healing capability, and a halochromic dye, i.e. bromothymol\nblue (BTB), undergoing colour change following infection-associated pH changes\n(pH: 5-6 --> >7). Two different BTB integration strategies, i.e.\nelectrospinning and drop-casting, were pursued to introduce long-lasting visual\ninfection detection capability through retention of BTB within the dressing.\nBoth systems had an average BTB loading efficiency of 99 wt.% and displayed a\ncolour change within one minute of contact with simulated wound fluid.\nDrop-cast samples retained up to 85 wt.% of BTB after 96 hours in a\nnear-infected wound environment, in contrast to the fibre-bearing prototypes,\nwhich released over 80 wt.% of BTB over the same time period. An increase in\ncollagen denaturation temperature (DSC) and red shifts (ATR-FTIR) suggests the\nformation of secondary interactions between the collagen-based hydrogel and the\nBTB, which are attributed to count for the long-lasting dye confinement and\ndurable dressing colour change. Given the high L929 fibroblast viability in\ndrop-cast sample extracts (92%, 7 days), the presented multiscale design is\nsimple, cell- and regulatory-friendly, and compliant with industrial scale-up.\nThis design, therefore, offers a new platform for the development of\ntheranostic dressings enabling accelerated wound healing and prompt infection\ndiagnosis.\n",

In this paper, we investigate how two\ndifferent mechanisms for growth control may affect tumour cell responses to\nfractionated radiotherapy (RT) by extending an existing ordinary differential\nequation model of tumour growth. In the absence of treatment, this model\ndistinguishes between growth arrest due to nutrient insufficiency and\ncompetition for space and exhibits three growth regimes: nutrient-limited (NL),\nspace limited (SL) and bistable (BS), where both mechanisms for growth arrest\ncoexist. We study the effect of RT for tumours in each regime, finding that\ntumours in the SL regime typically respond best to RT, while tumours in the BS\nregime typically respond worst to RT. For tumours in each regime, we also\nidentify the biological processes that may explain positive and negative\ntreatment outcomes and the dosing regimen which maximises the reduction in\ntumour burden.\n",

Bovine\npericardium (BP) is widely used as BHV leaflets. Previous computational studies\nassume BP density to be close to the density of water or blood. However, BP\nleaflets undergo multiple treatments such as fixation and anti-calcification.\nThe present study aims to measure the density of the BP used in BHVs and\ndetermine its effect on leaflet stress distribution.\n  Methods: We determined the density of eight square BP samples laser cut from\nEdwards BP patches. The weight of specimens was measured using an A&D\nAnalytical Balance, and volume was measured by high-resolution imaging. Finite\nelement models of a BHV similar to PERIMOUNT Magna were developed in ABAQUS.\n  Results: The average density value of the BP samples was 1410 kg/m3. In the\nacceleration phase of a cardiac cycle, the maximum stress value reached 1.89\nMPa for a density value of 1410 kg/m3 , and 2.47 MPa for a density of 1000\nkg/m3(30.7% difference).

        "summary": "  In the last decades, important progress has been achieved in the\nunderstanding of the neurotrophic effects of intermittent fasting (IF), caloric\nrestriction (CR) and exercise. Improved neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity\nand adult neurogenesis (NSPAN) are essential examples of these neurotrophic\neffects. The importance in this respect of the metabolic switch from glucose to\nketone bodies as cellular fuel has been highlighted. More recently, calorie\nrestriction mimetics (CRMs; resveratrol and other polyphenols in particular)\nhave been investigated thoroughly in relation to NSPAN. In the narrative review\nsections of this manuscript, recent findings on these essential functions are\nsynthesized and the most important molecules involved are presented. The most\nresearched signaling pathways (PI3K, Akt, mTOR, AMPK, GSK3$\\beta$, ULK, MAPK,\nPGC-1$\\alpha$, NF-$\\kappa$B, sirtuins, Notch, Sonic hedgehog and Wnt) and\nprocesses (e.g., anti-inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis) that support or\nthwart neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis are then briefly\npresented. This provides an accessible entry point to the literature. In the\nannotated bibliography section of this contribution, brief summaries are\nprovided of about 30 literature reviews relating to the neurotrophic effects of\ninterest in relation to IF, CR, CRMs and exercise. Most of the selected reviews\naddress these essential functions from the perspective of healthier aging\n(sometimes discussing epigenetic factors) and the reduction of the risk for\nneurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease,\nParkinson's disease) and depression or the improvement of cognitive function.\n",

The application of nano-fertilizers has achieved\nconsiderable interest due to their significant role as environmentally\nsustainable resources and soil health. Moreover, the increasing global\npopulation increased food insecurity, especially under climate change.\nNanotechnology has emerged as a promising alternative to help improving crop\ngrowth and productivity. However, un-balanced presence and long-term use of\nnano-particles alter photosynthesis, and induce cellular redox imbalances\nresulting in lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and DNA oxidative damage in\nplants, so more studies are still needed on their safe application with minimum\nside effects. In this paper, we reviewed nano-fertilizer mechanisms in plant,\nas well as their effects on microbiome and interaction with soil colloids. This\nstudy reviews the recent studies and findings about role of Nanotechnology in\nplant nutrition use efficiency to summarize a better understanding of this\nimportant issue. A comprehensive picture of ecological issues such as soil and\nwater contamination in response to nano-fertilizer application will also be\nassessed.\n",

Mechanical stimuli have\nbeen observed to improve whole-tissue function and cardiomyocyte (CM)\nmaturation, although our ability to fully utilize these mechanisms is hampered,\nin part, by our incomplete understanding of the mechanobiology of EHTs. In this\nwork, we leverage the experimental data produced by a mechanically tunable\nexperimental setup to generate tissue-specific computational models of EHTs.\nUsing imaging and functional data, our modeling pipeline generates models with\ntissue-specific ECM and myofibril structure, allowing us to estimate CM active\nstress. We use this experimental and modeling pipeline to study different\nmechanical environments, where we contrast the force output of the tissue with\nthe computed active stress of CMs. We show that the significant differences in\nmeasured experimental forces can largely be explained by the levels of\nmyofibril formation achieved by the CMs in the distinct mechanical\nenvironments, with active stress showing more muted variations across\nconditions. The presented model also enables us to dissect the relative\ncontributions of myofibrils and extracellular matrix to tissue force output, a\ntask difficult to address experimentally. These results highlight the\nimportance of tissue-specific modeling to augment EHT experiments, providing\ndeeper insights into the mechanobiology driving EHT function.\n",

We hypothesized that\nthe Ramadan fasting model (RFM), which involves fasting from dawn to dusk for a\nmonth, could provide potential therapeutic benefits and mitigate NAFLD.\nAccordingly, we aimed to validate this hypothesis using obese male rats.\nMethods: Rats were split into two groups (n = 24 per group), and they were\ngiven either a standard (S) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. During the\nlast four weeks of the study period, both S- and HFD-fed rats were subdivided\ninto eight groups to assess the effect of RFM with/without training (T) or\nglucose administration (G) on the lipid profile, liver enzymes, and liver\nstructure (n=6/group). Results: The HFD+RFM groups exhibited a significantly\nlower final body weight than that the HFDC group. Serum cholesterol,\nlow-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in\nthe HFD+RFM, HFD+RFM+T, and HFD+RFM+G groups than those in the HFDC group.\nCompared with the HFD-fed group, all groups had improved serum high-density\nlipoprotein levels. Furthermore, HFD groups subjected to RFM had reduced serum\nlevels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase compared with those\nof the HFD-fed group. Moreover, the liver histology has improved in rats\nsubjected to RFM compared with that of HFD-fed rats, which exhibited macro and\nmicro fat droplet accumulation. Conclusion: RFM can induce positive metabolic\nchanges and improve alterations associated with NAFLD, including weight gain,\nlipid profile, liver enzymes, and hepatic steatosis.\n",

        "summary": "  As an adoptive cellular therapy, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR\nT-cell) therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, but\nonly limited efficacy against solid tumors. Compared with blood cancers, solid\ntumors present a unique set of challenges that ultimately neutralize the\nfunction of CAR T-cells. One such barrier is antigen heterogeneity -\nvariability in the expression of the antigen on tumor cells. Success of CAR\nT-cell therapy in solid tumors is unlikely unless almost all the tumor cells\nexpress the specific antigen that CAR T-cells target. A critical question for\nsolving the heterogeneity problem is whether CAR T therapy induces bystander\neffects, such as antigen spreading. Antigen spreading occurs when CAR T-cells\nactivate other endogenous antitumor CD8 T cells against antigens that were not\noriginally targeted. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of CAR\nT-cell therapy for solid tumors that takes into consideration both antigen\nheterogeneity and bystander effects. Our model is based on in vivo treatment\ndata that includes a mixture of target antigen-positive and target\nantigen-negative tumor cells. We use our model to simulate large cohorts of\nvirtual patients to gain a better understanding of the relationship between\nbystander killing. We also investigate several strategies for enhancing the\nbystander effect and thus increasing the overall efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy\nfor solid tumor.\n",

We explore this suggestion in detail\nby building on our work in the previous accompanying Paper I, where we have\nstudied abnormal calcium releases and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in\ntwo state-of-the-art mathematical models for human ventricular myocytes. Here,\nwe carry out a detailed \\textit{in-silico} study of one of these models,\nnamely, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov TP06~\\cite{ten2006alternans} model. We\nincrease the L-type Ca-channel current $I_{\\rm{CaL}}$ to trigger LCRs, and\ncalcium leak through the ryanodine receptor (RyR) to trigger SCRs, in the\nmyocyte. We then perform multiscale simulations of coupled TP06-model myocytes\nin tissue in one-, two-, and three-dimensional (1D, 2D, and 3D) domains, with\nclumps of DAD-capable myocytes, to demonstrate how these clumps precipitate\npremature ventricular complexes (PVCs) that lead, in turn, to fibrillatory\nexcitations like spiral and scroll waves.

A clear understanding of the electrophysiological factors\nof cardiac myocytes, which lead to DADs, can suggest pharmacological targets\nthat can eliminate DAD-induced arrhythmias. Therefore, we carry out multiscale\ninvestigations of two mathematical models for human-ventricular myocytes,\nnamely, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov and the HuVEC15 model, at the levels of\nsingle myocytes, one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) tissue, and anatomically\nrealistic bi-ventricular domains. By using continuation analysis, we uncover\nsteady- to oscillatory-state transitions in the Ca\\textsuperscript{2+}\nconcentrations and show that they lead to DADs. We demonstrate that the\nSarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca\\textsuperscript{2+}-ATPase (SERCA) pump uptake\nrate and the Ca\\textsuperscript{2+} leak through the ryanodine-receptor (RyR)\nchannel impact this transition significantly. We show that the frequencies and\namplitudes of the DADs are key features that can be used to classify them into\nthree types.

Several studies hypothesize that the\nlatter better represents the prolonged and pronounced inflammation observed in\nconditions like sepsis. Yet, very few experimental studies have administered\nendotoxin using both strategies, leaving significant gaps in determining the\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for their differing immune responses. We use\nmathematical modeling to analyze cytokine data from two studies administering a\n2 ng/kg dose of endotoxin, one as a bolus and the other as a continuous\ninfusion over four hours. Using our model, we simulate the dynamics of mean and\nsubject-specific cytokine responses as well as the response to long-term\nendotoxin administration. Cytokine measurements reveal that the bolus injection\nleads to significantly higher peaks for IL-8, while IL-10 reaches significantly\nhigher peaks during continuous administration. Moreover, the peak timing of all\nmeasured cytokines occurs later in the continuous infusion. We identify three\nmodel parameters that significantly differ between the two administration\nmethods. Monocyte activation of IL-10 is greater during the continuous\ninfusion, while recovery rates of IL-8 is faster for the bolus injection. This\nsuggests that a continuous infusion elicits a stronger, longer-lasting systemic\nreaction through increased stimulation of monocyte anti-inflammatory mediator\nproduction and decreased recovery of pro-inflammatory catalysts. Furthermore,\nour continuous infusion model exhibits prolonged inflammation with recurrent\npeaks resolving within two days during long-term (20-32 hours) endotoxin\nadministration.\n",

In collagen fibrils, the main building\ncomponent of human tissue, these AGEs appear as fibrillar cross-links. When\nAGEs accumulate in collagen fibrils, a process often caused by diabetes and\naging, the mechanical properties of the collagen fibril are altered. However,\ncurrent knowledge about the mechanical properties of different types of AGEs,\nand their quantity in collagen fibrils is limited owing to the scarcity of\navailable experimental data. Consequently, the precise relationship between the\nnano-scale cross-link properties, their density in collagen fibrils, and the\nmechanical properties of the collagen fibrils at larger scales remains poorly\nunderstood. In our study, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations\nand perform destructive tensile tests on collagen fibrils to evaluate the\neffect of different cross-link densities and their mechanical properties on\ncollagen fibril deformation and fracture behavior. We observe that the collagen\nfibril stiffens at high strain levels when either the AGEs density or the\nloading energy capacity of AGEs are increased. We demonstrate that this\nstiffening is caused by a mechanism that favors energy absorption via\nstretching rather than inter-molecular sliding. Hence, in cross-linked collagen\nfibrils, the absorbed energy is stored rather than dissipated through friction,\nresulting in brittle fracture upon fibrillar failure. Further, by varying\nmultiple AGEs nano-scale parameters, we show that the AGEs loading energy\ncapacity is, aside from their density in the fibril, the unique factor\ndetermining the effect of different types of AGEs on the mechanical behavior of\ncollagen fibrils. Our results show that knowing AGEs properties is crucial for\nunderstanding of the origin of impaired tissue behavior.\n",

        "summary": "  Periodontitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are chronic inflammatory\nconditions, characterized by microbial dysbiosis and hyper-immunoinflammatory\nresponses. Growing evidence suggest an interconnection between periodontitis\nand IBD, implying a shift from the traditional concept of independent diseases\nto a complex, reciprocal cycle. This review outlines the evidence supporting an\nOral-Gut axis, marked by a higher prevalence of periodontitis in IBD patients\nand vice versa. The specific mechanisms linking periodontitis and IBD remain to\nbe fully elucidated, but emerging evidence points to the ectopic colonization\nof the gut by oral bacteria, which promote intestinal inflammation by\nactivating host immune responses. This review presents an in-depth examination\nof the interconnection between periodontitis and IBD, highlighting the shared\nmicrobiological and immunological pathways, and proposing a multi-hit\nhypothesis in the pathogenesis of periodontitis-mediated intestinal\ninflammation. Furthermore, the review underscores the critical need for a\ncollaborative approach between dentists and gastroenterologists to provide\nholistic oral-systemic healthcare.\n",

Kidneys play an instrumental role in transport and\nelimination of drugs and toxins. However, despite the well-established\npatient-to-patient differences in kidney function and disease manifestation,\nprogression and prognostic, few studies take this variability into\nconsideration. In particular, the discrepancies between female and male biology\nwarrants a better representation within kidney in vitro models. The omission of\nsex as a biological variable poses the significant risk of overlooking\nsex-specific mechanisms in health and disease and potential differences in drug\nefficacy and toxicity between males and females. This review aims to highlight\nthe importance of incorporating sex dimorphism in kidney in vitro models by\nexamining the sexual characteristics in the context of the current\nstate-of-the-art. Furthermore, this review underscores opportunities for\nimproving kidney models by incorporating sex-specific traits. Ultimately, this\nroadmap to incorporating sex-dimorphism in kidney in vitro models will\nfacilitate the creation of better models for studying sex-specific mechanisms\nin the kidney and their impact on drug efficacy and safety.\n",

Its determination requires the evaluation of\nthe mitotic score (MS) which is subject to low intra- and inter-observer\nreproducibility. The MS shall be performed in the most proliferative area of\nthe tumor, which determination is hard but critical. Artificial intelligence\nbased tools could help pathologists to detect mitosis on whole slide images\n(WSI). Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of a\nmitosis detection algorithms pecifically developed to assist the pathologist\nduring the evaluation of the MS on WSI. Methods: Algorithmic mitosis detection\nis a two-step process: first the algorithm detects candidate objects resembling\nmitosis, then the selection is refined by a classifier. The densest\nmitoticregions are shown to the pathologist, then he can establish the MS with\nalgorithm results. For this study, three expert pathologists have determined a\nconsensual ground truth for MS on fifty WSI of IBC. Those slides were also\nsubmitted to two readers pathologists who evaluated the MS of each slide twice,\nwith and without the assistance of the algorithm, with a four week wash-out\nperiod. Interobserver reproducibility was measured by evaluating the scores\nobtained with, and without assistance between two readers pathologists and was\nalso measured between each reader pathologist and the expert ground truth to\ndetermine the accuracy of the established score. Results:Baseline linearly\nweighted Cohen's Kappa for interobserver agreement of MS between two readers\npathologists was 0.482. Using the algorithm generated mitotic detection in WSI,\nthe agreement score increased to 0.672. Baseline linearly weighted Cohen's\nKappa for interobserver agreement of MS between each reader pathologist and\nexpert consensus was 0.378 and 0.457 for pathologist 1 and 2 respectively.\nUsing the algorithm generated mitoticdetection in WSI, the agreement score\nincreased respectively to 0.629 and 0.726. Conclusion:The use of the developed\nalgorithm constitutes a viable approach to assist the pathologist for the\nevaluation of the MS of IBC on WSI. Its use makes it possible to improve\ninterobserver reproducibility between pathologists and the accuracy of the\nscore established by expert consensus. The use of such a tool constitutes a new\napproach in the evaluation of the mitoticscore which could lead to an evolution\nof practices.\n",

There remains\nan unmet need for therapies that can halt or slow the course of AD. To address\nthis need, the FDA has provided a mechanism, under its Accelerated Approval\npathway, for potential therapeutics to be approved based in part on their\nability to reduce brain amyloid. Through this pathway, two monoclonal\nanti-amyloid antibodies, aducanumab and lecanemab, have been approved for\nclinical use. More recently, another amyloid-lowering antibody, donanemab,\ngenerated a statistically significant outcome in a phase 3 clinical trial and\nwill shortly come under FDA review. While these monoclonal antibodies are not\nyet routinely used in clinical practice, the series of recent positive clinical\ntrials has fostered enthusiasm amongst some AD experts. Here, we discuss three\nkey limitations regarding recent anti-amyloid clinical trials: (1) there is\nlittle to no evidence that amyloid reduction correlates with clinical outcome,\n(2) the reported efficacy of anti-amyloid therapies may be partly, or wholly,\nexplained by functional unblinding, and (3) donanemab in its phase 3 trial had\nno effect on tau burden, the pathological hallmark more closely related to\ncognition. Taken together, these observations call into question the efficacy\nof anti-amyloid therapies.\n",

Tragically,\nthe number of donor organs lost due to allograft vasculopathy (AV), generally\nnamed chronic vascular rejection or chronic rejection, has remained significant\nand unchanged for decades. We argue that designation of AV as chronic\nrejection, and its classification as a delayed long-lasting reaction of\nrecipient immune effectors against donor alloantigens have given us the wrong\nimpression that we have identified the necessary cause of the disease. However,\nwhatever treatment options we have in the anti-rejection toolbox, despite their\nsuccess in treating acute rejection, do not work for AV. Yet, the scientific\ncommunity has continued to conceptualize and approach AV within the\nalloimmunity and rejection model. Due to unproductive research from the\nalloimmunity perspective, the number of transplanted hearts lost due to this\npathology today is almost the same as it was fifty years ago. We believe that\nthis phenomenon falls under the rubric of linguistic relativity, and that the\nlanguage we chose to name the disease has restricted our cognitive ability to\nsolve the problem. While the initial perception of the AV as chronic rejection\nwas logical and scientific, the subsequent experience revealed that such\nperception and approach have been fruitless, and likely are incorrect.\nConsidering our tragic failure to prevent and treat allograft vasculopathy\nusing all available knowledge on alloimmunity and rejection, we must finally\ndisassociate the former from the latter. A good way to start this process is to\nchange the words we are using; particularly, the words we chose to name the\ndisease. We have to step out of the alloimmunity rejection box\n",

Under pathological conditions such as fibrosis, or in\nscar tissue, or across ablation lines myocytes can uncouple from their\nneighbours. Electrical conduction may still occur via fibroblasts that not only\ncouple proximal myocytes but can also couple otherwise unconnected regions. We\nhypothesise that such coupling can alter conduction between myocytes via\nintroduction of delays or by initiation of premature stimuli that can\npotentially result in reentry or conduction blocks. To test this hypothesis we\nhave developed several $2$-cell motifs and investigated the effect of\nfibroblast mediated electrical coupling between uncoupled myocytes. We have\nidentified various regimes of myocyte behaviour that depend on the strength of\ngap-junctional conductance, connection topology, and parameters of the myocyte\nand fibroblast models. These motifs are useful in developing a mechanistic\nunderstanding of long-distance coupling on myocyte dynamics and enable the\ncharacterisation of interaction between different features such as myocyte and\nfibroblast properties, coupling strengths and pacing period. They are\ncomputationally inexpensive and allow for incorporation of spatial effects such\nas conduction velocity. They provide a framework for constructing scar tissue\nboundaries and enable linking of cellular level interactions with scar induced\narrhythmia.\n",

To integrate therapeutic wound dressings with wound\nmonitoring capability at the point-of-care to enable informed clinical\ndecision-making, we investigate the encapsulation of a halochromic dye, i.e.\nbromothymol blue (BTB), onto two commercial dressings, i.e. Aquacel Extra and\nPromogran, through a simple drop-casting method. Our concept leverages the\ninfection-associated rise in wound pH, on the one hand, and BTB's colour change\ncapability in the pH range of healing (pH: 5-6) and infected wounds (pH > 7),\non the other hand. BTB-encapsulated samples show a prompt colour switch\n(yellow/orange --> blue) following 1-hour incubation at pH 8. The effect of\nswelling ratio, chemical composition and microstructure is then explored to\ndraw relationships between colour change capability and dressing dye retention.\n",

Chemicals often permeate tissues\nvia this paracellular route, meaning that permeation is underestimated. To\naddress this, measurements of human buccal mucosal tissue were conducted to\nascertain the width and tortuosity of extracellular spaces across the\nepithelium. Using mechanistic mathematical modelling, we show that the\nconvoluted geometry of extracellular spaces significantly impacts chemical\npermeation and that this can be approximated, provided that extracellular\ntortuosity is accounted for. We next developed an advanced physically-relevant\nin silico model of oral mucosal chemical permeation using partial differential\nequations, fitted to chemical permeation in vitro assays on tissue-engineered\nhuman oral mucosa. Tissue geometries were measured and captured in silico, and\npermeation examined and predicted for chemicals with different physicochemical\nproperties. The effect of altering the extracellular space to mimic permeation\nenhancers was also assessed by perturbing the in silico model. This novel in\nvitro-in silico approach has the potential to expedite pharmaceutical\ninnovation for testing oromucosal chemical permeation, providing a more\naccurate, physiologically-relevant model which can reduce animal testing with\nearly screening based on chemical properties.\n",

In this study we applied a coupled\nuncertainty quantification-finite element (FE) framework to understand the\nimpact of uncertainty in vascular material properties on variability in\npredicted stresses. Univariate probability distributions were fit to material\nparameters derived from layer-specific mechanical behavior testing of human\ncoronary tissue. Parameters were assumed to be probabilistically independent,\nallowing for efficient parameter ensemble sampling. In an idealized coronary\nartery geometry, a forward FE model for each parameter ensemble was created to\npredict tissue stresses under physiologic loading. An emulator was constructed\nwithin the UncertainSCI software using polynomial chaos techniques, and\nstatistics and sensitivities were directly computed. Results demonstrated that\nmaterial parameter uncertainty propagates to variability in predicted stresses\nacross the vessel wall, with the largest dispersions in stress within the\nadventitial layer. Variability in stress was most sensitive to uncertainties in\nthe anisotropic component of the strain energy function. Unary and binary\ninteractions within the adventitial layer were the main contributors to stress\nvariance, and the leading factor in stress variability was uncertainty in the\nstress-like material parameter summarizing contribution of the embedded fibers\nto the overall artery stiffness. Results from a patient-specific coronary model\nconfirmed many of these findings. Collectively, this highlights the impact of\nmaterial property variation on predicted artery stresses and presents a\npipeline to explore and characterize uncertainty in computational biomechanics.\n",

        "summary": "  Osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic disease characterized by articular cartilage\ndegeneration, is a leading cause of disability and pain worldwide. In OA,\nchondrocytes in cartilage undergo phenotypic changes and senescence,\nrestricting cartilage regeneration and favouring disease progression. Similar\nto other wound-healing disorders, chondrocytes from OA patients show a chronic\nincrease in the gap junction channel protein connexin43 (Cx43), which regulates\nsignal transduction through the exchange of elements or recruitment/release of\nsignalling factors. Although immature or stem-like cells are present in\ncartilage from OA patients, their origin and role in disease progression are\nunknown. In this study, we found that Cx43 acts as a positive regulator of\nchondrocyte-mesenchymal transition. Downregulation of either Cx43 by\nCRISPR/Cas9 or Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC)\nby carbenoxolone treatment triggered rediferentiation of osteoarthritic\nchondrocytes into a more differentiated state, associated with decreased\nsynthesis of MMPs and proinflammatory factors, and reduced senescence. We have\nidentified causal Cx43-sensitive circuit in chondrocytes that regulates\ndedifferentiation, redifferentiation and senescence. We propose that\nchondrocytes undergo chondrocyte-mesenchymal transition where increased\nCx43-mediated GJIC during OA facilitates Twist-1 nuclear translocation as a\nnovel mechanism involved in OA progression. These findings support the use of\nCx43 as an appropriate therapeutic target to halt OA progression and to promote\ncartilage regeneration.\n",

Methods: A consecutive cohort of 108 patients\nundergoing minimally invasive elective procedures for colorectal cancer was\nprospectively enrolled. The difference between macro and microperfusion DeltaT\nwas obtained by calculating the timing of fluorescence at the level of iliac\nartery division and colonic wall, respectively.

This can be challenging, especially when degradable\nsystems with high water content and hydrolysable chemical bonds are required in\nanatomical sites under constant mechanical stimulation, e.g. a foot ulcer\ncavity. In these circumstances, the design of hydrogel composites is a\npromising strategy to provide controlled structural features and macroscopic\nproperties over time. To explore this strategy, the synthesis of a new\nphotocurable elastomeric polymer, poly(glycerol-co-sebacic acid-co-lactic\nacid-co-polyethylene glycol) acrylate (PGSLPA), is investigated, along with its\nprocessing into UV-cured hydrogels, electrospun nonwovens and fibre-reinforced\nvariants, without the need for a high temperature curing step or use of\nhazardous solvents. The mechanical properties of bioresorbable PGSLPA hydrogels\nwere studied with and without electrospun nonwoven reinforcement and with\nvaried layered configurations, aiming to determine the effects of\nmicrostructure on bulk compressive strength and elasticity. The nonwoven\nreinforced PGSLPA hydrogels exhibited a 60 % increase in compressive strength\nand an 80 % increase in elastic moduli compared to fibre-free PGSLPA samples.\nMechanical properties of the fibre-reinforced hydrogels could also be modulated\nby altering the layering arrangement of the nonwoven and hydrogel phase.

The mechanical behavior of the fibril itself is determined by its\nstructure: the content of collagen molecules, minerals, and cross-links, and\nthe mechanical interactions and properties of these components.\nAdvanced-Glycation-Endproducts (AGEs) cross-linking between tropocollagen\nmolecules within the collagen fibril is one important factor that is believed\nto have a major influence on the tissue. For instance, it has been shown that\nbrittleness in bone correlates with increased AGEs densities. However, the\nunderlying nano-scale mechanisms within the mineralized collagen fibril remain\nunknown. Here, we study the effect of mineral and AGEs cross-linking on fibril\ndeformation and fracture behavior by performing destructive tensile tests using\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that\nafter exceeding a critical content of mineral, it induces stiffening of the\ncollagen fibril at high strain levels. We show that mineral morphology and\nlocation affect collagen fibril mechanics: The mineral content at which this\nstiffening occurs depends on the mineral's location and morphology. Further,\nboth, increasing AGEs density and mineral content lead to stiffening and\nincreased peak stresses. At low mineral contents, the mechanical response of\nthe fibril is dominated by the AGEs, while at high mineral contents, the\nmineral itself determines fibril mechanics.\n",

The model incorporates distal\nairway constrictions representative of cystic fibrosis, allowing us to\ninvestigate the resulting impact on patterns of deposition.

Deposition is\nreduced in airways directly distal and proximal to constrictions. When\nconstrictions are clustered together, central-airways deposition can increase\nsignificantly in regions away from constrictions, but distal-airways deposition\nin those regions remains largely unchanged. We use our model to calculate lung\nclearance index (LCI), a clinical measure of ventilation heterogeneity, after\napplying constrictions of varying severities in one lobe.

The constrained mixture theory\ndescribes fundamental mechanobiological processes in soft tissue G&R and has\nbeen widely adopted in cardiovascular models of G&R. However, even after two\ndecades of work, large organ-scale models are rare, mainly due to high\ncomputational costs (model evaluation and memory consumption), especially in\nlong-range simulations. We propose two strategies to adaptively integrate\nhistory variables in constrained mixture models to enable large organ-scale\nsimulations of G&R. Both strategies exploit that the influence of deposited\ntissue on the current mixture decreases over time through degradation. One\nstrategy is independent of external loading, allowing the estimation of the\ncomputational resources ahead of the simulation. The other adapts the history\nsnapshots based on the local mechanobiological environment so that the\nadditional integration errors can be controlled and kept negligibly small, even\nin G&R scenarios with severe perturbations. We analyze the adaptively\nintegrated constrained mixture model on a tissue patch for a parameter study\nand show the performance under different G&R scenarios. To confirm that\nadaptive strategies enable large organ-scale examples, we show simulations of\ndifferent hypertension conditions with a real-world example of a biventricular\nheart discretized with a finite element mesh. In our example, adaptive\nintegrations sped up simulations by a factor of three and reduced memory\nrequirements to one-sixth. The reduction of the computational costs gets even\nmore pronounced for simulations over longer periods. Adaptive integration of\nthe history variables allows studying more finely resolved models and longer\nG&R periods while computational costs are drastically reduced and largely\nconstant in time.\n",

IgM binding to porcine proteins, primarily CD9\nand CD46, previously identified as immunogenic in pig to non-human primate\ncardiac xenograft recipients, was detected in 28 of the 160 swine veterinarian\nsamples. These results suggest that barcoded HEK cell lines expressing porcine\nprotein antigens can be useful for screening human patient serum.

        "summary": "  Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is a group of diseases that\nadversely affect the passive phase of the cardiac cycle and can lead to heart\nfailure. While left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is a valuable\nprognostic measure in LVDD patients, traditional invasive methods of measuring\nLVEDP present risks and limitations, highlighting the need for alternative\napproaches. This paper investigates the possibility of measuring LVEDP\nnon-invasively using inverse in-silico modeling. We propose the adoption of\npatient-specific cardiac modeling and simulation to estimate LVEDP and\nmyocardial stiffness from cardiac strains. We have developed a high-fidelity\npatient-specific computational model of the left ventricle. Through an inverse\nmodeling approach, myocardial stiffness and LVEDP were accurately estimated\nfrom cardiac strains that can be acquired from in vivo imaging, indicating the\nfeasibility of computational modeling to augment current approaches in the\nmeasurement of ventricular pressure. Integration of such computational\nplatforms into clinical practice holds promise for early detection and\ncomprehensive assessment of LVDD with reduced risk for patients.\n",

Our objective\nwas to study which mechanism (central or local) is responsible for changes in\nblood flow fluctuations at around 0.1 Hz. We used the method of imaging\nphotoplethysmography synchronized with electrocardiography to measure\nblood-flow response to local forearm heating of 18 healthy male volunteers. The\ndynamics of peripheral perfusion was revealed by a correlation processing of\nphotoplethysmography data, and the central hemodynamics was assessed from the\nelectrocardiogram. Wavelet analysis was used to estimate the dynamics of\nspectral components. Our results show that skin heating leads to multiple\nincrease in local perfusion accompanied by drop in blood flow oscillations at\n0.1 Hz, whereas no changes in heart rate variability was observed. After\nswitching off the heating, perfusion remains at the high level, regardless\ndecrease in skin temperature. The 0.1 Hz oscillations are smoothly recovered to\nthe base level. In conclusion, we confirm the local nature of fluctuations in\nperipheral blood flow in the frequency band of about 0.1 Hz. A significant, but\ntime-delayed, recovery of fluctuation energy in this frequency range after\ncessation of the skin warming was discovered. This study reveals a novel factor\ninvolved in the regulation microcirculatory vascular tone. A comprehensive\nstudy of hemodynamics using the new technique of imaging photoplethysmography\nsynchronized with electrocardiography is a prerequisite for development of a\nvaluable diagnostic tool.\n",

Specifically it evaluates the\nability of Schwendener disk-stacking models to generate parastichy patterns\nseen in a large dataset of sunflower seedheads. We find that features of this\ndata that the models can account for include a predominance of Fibonacci\ncounts, usually in a pair of left and right counts on a single seedhead, a\nsmaller but detectable frequency of Lucas and double Fibonacci numbers, a\ncomparable frequency of Fibonacci numbers plus or minus one, and occurrences of\npairs of roughly equal but non-Fibonacci counts in a `columnar' structure. A\nfurther observation in the dataset was an occasional lack of rotational\nsymmetry in the parastichy spirals, and this paper demonstrates those in the\nmodel for the first time.\n  Schwendener disk-stacking models allow Fibonacci structure by ensuring that a\nparameter of the model corresponding to the speed of plant growth is kept small\nenough. While many other models can exhibit Fibonacci structure, usually by\nspecifying a rotation parameter to an extremely high precision, no other model\nhas accounted for further, non-Fibonacci, features in the observed data. The\nSchwendener model produces these naturally in the region of parameter space\njust beyond where the Fibonacci structure breaks down, without any further\nparameter fitting. We also introduce stochasticity into the model and show that\nit while it can be responsible for the appearance of columnar structure, the\ndisordered dynamics of the deterministic system near the critical region can\nalso generate this structure.\n",

Aim: This study\naimed to develop a low-cost, portable, programmable scanning diffuse speckle\ncontrast imaging (PS-DSCI) technology for fast, high-density, and\ndepth-sensitive imaging of CBF in rodents. Approach: The PS-DSCI employed a\nprogrammable digital micromirror device (DMD) for remote line-shape laser (785\nnm) scanning on tissue surface and synchronized a 2D camera for capturing\nboundary diffuse laser speckle contrasts. New algorithms were developed to\naddress deformations of line-shape scanning, thus minimizing CBF reconstruction\nartifacts.

        "summary": "  Introduction: Deep learning models hold great promise for digital pathology,\nbut their opaque decision-making processes undermine trust and hinder clinical\nadoption. Explainable AI methods are essential to enhance model transparency\nand reliability. Methods: We developed HIPPO, an explainable AI framework that\nsystematically modifies tissue regions in whole slide images to generate image\ncounterfactuals, enabling quantitative hypothesis testing, bias detection, and\nmodel evaluation beyond traditional performance metrics. HIPPO was applied to a\nvariety of clinically important tasks, including breast metastasis detection in\naxillary lymph nodes, prognostication in breast cancer and melanoma, and IDH\nmutation classification in gliomas. In computational experiments, HIPPO was\ncompared against traditional metrics and attention-based approaches to assess\nits ability to identify key tissue elements driving model predictions. Results:\nIn metastasis detection, HIPPO uncovered critical model limitations that were\nundetectable by standard performance metrics or attention-based methods. For\nprognostic prediction, HIPPO outperformed attention by providing more nuanced\ninsights into tissue elements influencing outcomes. In a proof-of-concept\nstudy, HIPPO facilitated hypothesis generation for identifying melanoma\npatients who may benefit from immunotherapy. In IDH mutation classification,\nHIPPO more robustly identified the pathology regions responsible for false\nnegatives compared to attention, suggesting its potential to outperform\nattention in explaining model decisions. Conclusions: HIPPO expands the\nexplainable AI toolkit for computational pathology by enabling deeper insights\ninto model behavior. This framework supports the trustworthy development,\ndeployment, and regulation of weakly-supervised models in clinical and research\nsettings, promoting their broader adoption in digital pathology.\n",

Due to the\neffect and importance of aesthetics and artificial reproduction of these fish,\nwhich may be enclosed in aquarium environments and come in contact with\ncigarette smoke, the effects of tobacco smoke on the gonad tissue of goldfish\nwere investigated. For this purpose, 60 goldfish randomly (weight 100gr)\ndivided in 3 groups and were released in tanks containing 10 liters of water\n(temperature: 20, hardness: 14 ppt, pH: 7/8). After adaptation, in treatment 1,\n1gr of tobacco was heated daily with a direct flame, and the resulting smoke\nwas collected and injected into water with an air pump, in treatment 2, this\nprocess was done twice a day. After 3 months, fish gonads tissue were sampled\nand histopathological slides were investigated. The results showed that in the\ntreatment 2, there were early and immature oocytes in the ovarian tissue in\ncomparison to other groups. Also, in the testes of fish of treatment 2, the\nreduction of spermatozoids and the higher number of spermatogonia were\nobserved. In the treatment 3, these changes were more. A significant difference\nbetween the groups in both female and male was observed at the sexual\nmaturation stages (P<0.001). Based on this study, the dissolution of tobacco\nsmoke can have a negative effect on the process of sexual reproduction and fish\nexposed to more smoke are more likely to be sterile, and these changes were\nobserved in both males and female.\n",

Materials and Methods: Dermatologic specimens of 7\ncadavers were prepared. Specimens were molded with polyvinyl siloxane and casts\nprepared with resin, which were scanned using a 3D white light optical\nprofiler. Each scan produced 48 variables, categorized into 3 groups for each\nlocation: control, lesion center, and lesion edge. Images of the histopathology\nslides for suspected seborrheic keratoses were reviewed by a\ndermatopathologist. Results: The parameters under investigation included border\nversus center of keratoses, age, sex, lesion location, degree of sun exposure,\nand cause of death. Although some parameters differ between individuals and age\ngroups, the majority of differences identified between the roughness parameters\nmeasured are a result of sex, sun exposure, and histological diagnosis, listed\nin order of increasing importance. Histological diagnosis provided the most\nsignificant, definitive number of individual measurements of areas of roughness\nin seborrheic keratoses in comparison to other parts of the skin (regardless if\nthose were controls or a different pigmented lesion aside from seborrheic\nkeratoses). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that there are quantifiable\npatterns of surface textures that can be compared between keratotic and\nstandard normal skin surfaces. These findings suggest this method has the\npotential to be applied as a noninvasive adjunct to current methods of\ndermatological diagnosis.\n",

We situate EMG within a family of embodied interaction modalities,\nwhere it occupies a middle ground, considered as a ''signal from the inside''\ncompared with external observations of the body (e.g., motion capture), but\nalso seen as more volitional than neurological states recorded by brain\nelectroencephalogram (EEG). To understand the messiness of gestural interaction\nafforded by EMG, we revisit the phenomenological turn in HCI, reading Paul\nDourish's work on the transparency of ''ready-to-hand'' technologies against\nthe grain of recent posthumanist theories, which offer a performative\ninterpretation of musical entanglements between bodies, signals, and\nrepresentations. We take music performance as a use case, reporting on the\nopportunities and constraints posed by EMG in workshop-based studies of vocal,\ninstrumental, and electronic practices. We observe that across our diverse\nrange of musical subjects, they consistently challenged notions of EMG as a\ntransparent tool that directly registered the state of the body, reporting\ninstead that it took on ''present-at-hand'' qualities, defamiliarising the\nperformer's own sense of themselves and reconfiguring their embodied practice.\n",

CFD simulations were used in this work to study the interplay between\nocular fluid dynamics and drug diffusion to explore the options to achieve a\nhomogeneous drug distribution. The analysis finds that the balance between\nconvection and diffusion flux hinders mixing within the eye's anterior chamber.\nThis results in highly localized drug delivery in the trabecular meshwork when\nusing a gravity-driven location implant. The results also show that varying the\nsize of the implant can help to solve the issue. Given the natural variability\nof the trabecular meshwork size amongst patients, implants with personalized\nsize may become a potential solution. The location of the implant within the\neye is also key to effective drug delivery. Natural laminar flow of aqueous\nhumor within the eye's anterior chamber prevents achieving an even drug\ndistribution at the target tissue for gravity-driven location implants.\nHowever, the iris-lens gap can be utilized as a natural mixer when placing the\nimplant in the eye's posterior chamber, thus helping with effective delivery.\n",

Assessing pregnancy health often relies on diagnostic\nmarkers such as the labyrinth zone (LZ) proportion within the placenta. This\nstudy aimed to investigate the impact of disrupted circadian rhythms on\nplacental health and fetal development using animal models. Methods and\nResults: Employing unstained photo-acoustic microscopy (PAM) and hematoxylin\nand eosin (HE)-stained images, we found them mutually reinforcing. Our images\nrevealed the role of MCRD on the LZ and fetus weight: a decrease in LZ area\nfrom 5.01-HE(4.25-PAM) mm2 to 3.58-HE (2.62-PAM) mm2 on day 16 and\n6.48-HE(5.16-PAM) mm2 to 4.61-HE (3.03-PAM) mm2 on day 18, resulting in 0.71\ntimes lower fetus weights. We have discriminated a decrease in the mean LZ to\nplacenta area ratio from 64% to 47% on day 18 in mice with disrupted circadian\nrhythms with PAM. Discussion: The study highlights the negative influence of\ncircadian rhythm disruption on placental development and fetal well-being.\nReduced LZ area and fetal weights in the MCRD group suggest compromised\nplacental function under disrupted circadian rhythms. PAM imaging proved to be\nan efficient technique for assessing placental development, offering advantages\nover traditional staining methods. These findings contribute to understanding\nthe mechanisms underlying circadian disruption's effects on reproductive health\nand fetal development, emphasizing the importance of maintaining normal\ncircadian rhythms for optimal pregnancy outcomes.

So far, these models have expanded our\nunderstanding of ocular fluid dynamics, including descriptions of fluid flow\nprofiles within the anterior chamber of the eye under glaucomatous conditions.\nWith the emergence of models with complex multiphysics capabilities (not only\non fluid dynamics, but also diffusion, heat transfer and fluid-structure\ninteraction), there are now even greater possibilities for the application of\nmechanistic models to help with current challenges in glaucoma, such as the\ndesign of drug-releasing implants, novel glaucoma drainage devices, minimally\ninvasive glaucoma surgery procedures, and laser peripheral iridotomy.\n",

In this study, we\nemployed a musculoskeletal head-neck model to understand the effect of impact\nlocations, characteristics, and neck strength on head and neck injury severity.\nThree types of impact forces were studied: low-velocity impact (LVI),\nintermediate-velocity impact (IVI), and high-velocity impact (HVI). We\ninvestigated six parameters: linear and rotational accelerations, the\nGeneralized Acceleration Model For Brain Injury Threshold (GAMBIT), neck force,\nneck moment, and Neck Injury Criteria (NIC). We consider seven impact\nlocations, three neck strengths, and three impact characteristics. We studied a\ntotal of 63 cases. It was found that the linear accelerations do not change\nmuch with different neck strengths and impact locations. The impact locations\nhave a significant effect on head and neck injury parameters, and anterolateral\nimpact is the most risky impact location for both head and neck. The maximum\naverage rotational acceleration is for anterolateral eccentric impact which is\n4.75 times more than the average anterior central impact. The lateral impacts\ngenerate about 10% more linear accelerations than anterior and posterior\nimpacts. Neck forces do not vary more than 20% with impact locations and neck\nstrength. The average head and neck injury parameters do not vary more than 10%\nbased on neck strength. Impact characteristics have a significant role in\nGAMBIT and NIC. The average GAMBIT for IVI and HVI were 1.44 and 1.54 times\nhigher than LVI. In summary, the anterolateral eccentric impact has a higher\nprobability of head and neck injury than the other six impact locations. These\nfindings provide objective evidence that can inform injury prevention\nstrategies as well as aid tissue and cellular level studies.\n",

However, there are differences in\ncardiac cells that are not well characterized but cause spatial heterogeneity\nof the electrical properties in tissue. Optical mapping can be used to obtain\nexperimental data from cardiac surfaces at high spatial resolution. Variations\nin model parameters can be defined on a coarser grid than considering each\nsingle pixel, which would allow a representation of heterogeneous tissue to be\nobtained more efficiently. Here, we address how coarse the parameterization\ngrid can be while still obtaining accurate results for complicated dynamical\nstates of spatially discordant alternans. We use the Fenton-Karma model with\nheterogeneity included as a smooth nonlinear gradient over space for more model\nparameters. To obtain the more efficient representations, we set parameter\nvalues everywhere in space based on the assumption that the exact parameter\nvalues are known at the points of the coarser grid; we assume the parameter\nvalues could be obtained from experimental data. We assign parameter values in\nspace by fitting either a piecewise-constant or piecewise-linear function to\nthe spatially coarse known data. We wish to identify the maximal grid spacing\nof such points to obtain good agreement with spatial profiles of action\npotential duration during complex states. We find that coarse grid spacing of\nabout 1.0-1.6 cm generally results in spatial profiles that agree well with the\ntrue profiles for a range of different model parameters and different functions\nof those parameters over space. In addition, the piecewise-constant and\npiecewise-linear functions perform similarly. Our results to date suggest that\nmatching the output of models of cardiac tissue to heterogeneous experimental\ndata can be done efficiently, even during complex dynamical states.\n",

A mathematical model\nfor energy expenditure can be useful in estimating real-time costs of movements\nor to predict energy optimal movements. Metabolic cost models developed so far\nhave predominantly aimed at dynamic movement tasks, where mechanical work\ndominates. Further, while it is known that both force magnitude and rate of\nchange of force (force rate) affect metabolic cost, it is not known how these\nterms interact, or if the force rate dependence can be a consequence of the\nforce dependence. Here, we performed extensive human subject experiments,\ninvolving each subject over 5 hours of metabolic trials, which systematically\nchanged the mean forces and forces rates so as to characterize a holistic\nrelation for metabolic cost based on both force and force rate -- or\nanalogously, torque and torque rate. Our experiments involved humans producing\nsymmetric or asymmetric sinusoidal forces with different means, amplitudes,\nfrequencies, and rise and fall periods. We showed that the metabolic cost can\nbe well-approximated by a sum of power law functions of torque and torque rate.\nWe found that the metabolic cost scales non-linearly with joint torque (with\nexponent = 1.36) and non-linearly with torque rate (with exponent = 2.5).\nSurprisingly, the data suggested that the cost was roughly four times higher\nfor decreasing the torque than increasing, mirroring the analogous ratio\nbetween the cost of positive and negative work. Using these metabolic cost\nrelations, we show that if the metabolic cost scales with particular exponents\nwith muscle force and force rates, the same exponents will be observed in\nmulti-joint tasks with multiple muscles. Our new metabolic cost model involving\nboth force and force rate will potentially allow better predictions of energy\noptimal movements and thus inform wearable robot design and analysis.\n",

This {\\guillemotleft} filling\nlaw {\\guillemotright} has many consequences, in particular on the shape of\ngrowing folded leaves. This is shown here for different types of folding and\npacking. The folded volume is always part of an ellipsoid, with the veins on\nthe outside rounded face, and the lamina margin on an adaxial plane or axis.\nThe veins on the abaxial side protect the more fragile lamina. The first\ngeneral consequence of the folds is the presence of symmetries on the leaf\nshape, but also quantitative relationships between lobes and sinus sizes. For\nparticular geometries, the leaf lamina can be limited by lateral veins,\ncreating spoon-like lobes, or transverse cuts, creating asymmetrical wavy\nperimeters. A change in the packing between cultivars induces the corresponding\nchange in the leaf shape. Each particular case shows how pervasive are the\ngeometrical consequences of the filling law.\n",

Here we present theoretical analysis of the waves of electrical\nactivity that can rise on the boundary of cardiac cell network upon its\nrecovery from ischaemia-like conditions. The main factors included in our\nanalysis are macroscopic gradients of the cell-to-cell coupling and cell\nexcitability and microscopic heterogeneity of individual cells. The interplay\nbetween these factors allows one to explain how spirals form, drift together\nwith the moving boundary, get transiently pinned to local inhomogeneities, and\nfinally penetrate into the bulk of the well-coupled tissue where they reach\nmacroscopic scale. The asymptotic theory of the drift of spiral and scroll\nwaves based on response functions provides explanation of the drifts involved\nin this mechanism, with the exception of effects due to the discreteness of\ncardiac tissue. In particular, this asymptotic theory allows an extrapolation\nof 2D events into 3D, which has shown that cells within the border zone can\ngive rise to 3D analogues of spirals, the scroll waves. When and if such scroll\nwaves escape into a better coupled tissue, they are likely to collapse due to\nthe positive filament tension. However, our simulations have shown that such\ncollapse of newly generated scrolls is not inevitable and that under certain\nconditions filament tension becomes negative, leading to scroll filaments to\nexpand and multiply leading to a fibrillation-like state within small areas of\ncardiac tissue.\n",

Previously, attempts were made to\nobtain this data on ME soft tissue structures as well. However, due to low\nX-ray absorption of soft tissue, quality of these images is limited. Another\npopular approach is using histological sections as data for 3D models,\ndelivering high in-plane resolution for the sections, but the technique is\ndestructive in nature and registration of the sections is difficult. We combine\ndata from high-resolution \\mu CT recordings with data from high-resolution\northogonal-plane fluorescence optical-sectioning microscopy (OPFOS), both\nobtained on the same gerbil specimen. State-of-the-art \\mu CT delivers\nhigh-resolution data on the three-dimensional shape of ossicles and other ME\nbony structures, while the OPFOS setup generates data of unprecedented quality\nboth on bone and soft tissue ME structures. Each of these techniques is\ntomographic and non-destructive, and delivers sets of automatically aligned\nvirtual sections. The datasets coming from different techniques need to be\nregistered with respect to each other.

        "summary": "  Age-related bone loss and postmenopausal osteoporosis are disorders of bone\nremodelling, in which less bone is reformed than resorbed. Yet, this\ndysregulation of bone remodelling does not occur equally in all bone regions.\nLoss of bone is more pronounced near and at the endocortex, leading to cortical\nwall thinning and medullary cavity expansion, a process sometimes referred to\nas \"trabecularisation\" or \"cancellisation\". Cortical wall thinning is of\nprimary concern in osteoporosis due to the strong deterioration of bone\nmechanical properties that it is associated with. In this paper, we examine the\npossibility that the non-uniformity of microscopic bone surface availability\ncould explain the non-uniformity of bone loss in osteoporosis. We use a\ncomputational model of bone remodelling in which microscopic bone surface\navailability influences bone turnover rate and simulate the evolution of the\nbone volume fraction profile across the midshaft of a long bone. We find that\nbone loss is accelerated near the endocortical wall where the specific surface\nis highest. Over time, this leads to a substantial reduction of cortical wall\nthickness from the endosteum. The associated expansion of the medullary cavity\ncan be made to match experimentally observed cross-sectional data from the\nMelbourne Femur Collection. Finally, we calculate the redistribution of the\nmechanical stresses in this evolving bone structure and show that mechanical\nload becomes critically transferred to the periosteal cortical bone.\n",

Understanding the origin and\nevolution of bilateral organisms requires an understanding of how bilateral\nsymmetry develops, starting from a single cell. Bilateral symmetric growth of a\nmulticellular organism from a single starter cell is explained as resulting\nfrom the opposite handedness and orientation along one axis in two daughter\nfounder cells that are in equivalent developmental control network states.\nSeveral methods of establishing the initial orientation of the daughter cells\n(including oriented cell division and cell signaling) are discussed. The\norientation states of the daughter cells are epigenetically inherited by their\nprogeny. This results in mirror development with the two founding daughter\ncells generating complementary mirror image multicellular morphologies. The end\nproduct is a bilateral symmetric organism. The theory gives a unified\nexplanation of diverse phenomena including symmetry breaking, situs inversus,\ngynandromorphs, inside-out growth, bilaterally symmetric cancers, and the\nrapid, punctuated evolution of bilaterally symmetric organisms in the Cambrian\nExplosion. The theory is supported by experimental results on early embryonic\ndevelopment. The theory makes precise testable predications.\n",

Once inside the symplast, zinc is transported to the\npericycle, where it exits by means of HMA (Heavy Metal ATPase) transporters.\nThe combination of symplastic transport and spatial separation of influx and\nefflux produces a pattern in which zinc accumulates in the pericycle. Here,\nmathematical modelling was employed to study the importance of ZIP regulation,\nHMA abundance and symplastic transport in creation of the radial pattern of\nzinc in primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana.\n  A comprehensive one-dimensional dynamic model of radial zinc transport in\nroots was developed and used to conduct simulations. The model accounts for the\nstructure of the root consisting of symplast and apoplast and includes effects\nof water flow, diffusion, and cross-membrane transport via transporters. It\nalso incorporates the radial geometry and varying porosity of root tissues, as\nwell as regulation of ZIP transporters.\n  Steady state patterns were calculated for various zinc concentrations in the\nmedium, water influx and HMA abundance. The experimentally observed zinc\ngradient was reproduced very well. Increase of HMA or decrease in water influx\nled to loss of the gradient. The dynamic behaviour for a change in medium\nconcentration and water influx was also simulated showing short adaptation\ntimes in the range of seconds to minutes. Slowing down regulation led to\noscillations in expression levels, suggesting the need for rapid regulation and\nexistence of buffering agents.\n  The model captures the experimental findings very well and confirms the\nhypothesis that low abundance of HMA4 produces a radial gradient in zinc\nconcentration. Surprisingly, transpiration was found to be also a key\nparameter. The model suggests that ZIP regulation takes place on a comparable\ntime scale as symplastic transport.\n",

Because of the no-slip boundary condition at the cell\nsurface, the upper stroke away from the boundary generates leftward flow, and\nthe lower stroke close to the boundary generates slower rightward flow. By\ncombining computational fluid dynamics with experimental observations, we\ndemonstrate that the leftward stroke can be more effective than expected for\ncases in which cilia tilting alone is considered with the no-slip condition\nunder constant driving force. Our results suggest that the driving force is\nasymmetric and that it is determined by the tilting angle and open angle of the\nrotating cilia.

By\nsearching the published literature for ovarian volume in healthy females, and\nusing our own data from multiple sources (combined n = 59,994) we have\ngenerated and robustly validated the first model of ovarian volume from\nconception to 82 years of age. This model shows that 69% of the variation in\novarian volume is due to age alone. We have shown that in the average case\novarian volume rises from 0.7 mL (95% CI 0.4 -- 1.1 mL) at 2 years of age to a\npeak of 7.7 mL (95% CI 6.5 -- 9.2 mL) at 20 years of age with a subsequent\ndecline to about 2.8mL (95% CI 2.7 -- 2.9 mL) at the menopause and smaller\nvolumes thereafter. Our model allows us to generate normal values and ranges\nfor ovarian volume throughout life. This is the first validated normative model\nof ovarian volume from conception to old age; it will be of use in the\ndiagnosis and management of a number of diverse gynaecological and reproductive\nconditions in females from birth to menopause and beyond.\n",

Our interest arises from\nthe observation that if inter-patient variations in OAR and tumor sensitivities\nto radiation or sparing factor of the OAR are not accounted for during\nradiation scheduling, the performance of the therapy may be strongly degraded\nor the OAR may receive a substantially larger dose than the maximum threshold.\nThis paper proposes two radiation scheduling concepts to incorporate\ninter-patient variability into the scheduling optimization problem. The first\napproach is a robust formulation that formulates the problem as a conservative\nmodel that optimizes the worst case dose scheduling that may occur. The second\nmethod is a probabilistic approach, where the model parameters are given by a\nset of random variables. This formulation insures that our constraints are\nsatisfied with a given probability, and that our objective function achieves a\ndesired level with a stated probability. We used a transformation to reduce the\nresulting optimization problem to two dimensions. We showed that the optimal\nsolution lies on the boundary of the feasible region and we used a branch and\nbound algorithm to find the global optimal solution. We observed that if the\nnumber of fractions in the optimal conventional schedule is the same as the\nrobust and stochastic solutions, it is preferable to administer equal or\nsmaller total dose. In addition if there exist more (fewer) treatment sessions\nin the probabilistic or robust solution compared to the conventional schedule,\na reduction in total dose squared (total dose) will be expected. Finally, we\nperformed numerical experiments in the setting of head-and-neck tumors to\nreveal the effect of parameter uncertainty on optimal schedules and to evaluate\nthe sensitivity of the model to the choice of key model parameters.\n",

Here we\nshow that orienting cell divisions by tension constitutes an efficient\nmechanism by which the Enveloping Cell Layer (EVL) releases anisotropic tension\nwhile undergoing spreading during zebrafish epiboly. The control of EVL\ncell-division orientation by tension involves cell elongation and requires\nmyosin II activity to align the mitotic spindle with the main tension axis. We\nalso found that in the absence of tension-oriented cell divisions and in the\npresence of increased tissue tension, EVL cells undergo ectopic fusions,\nsuggesting that the reduction of tension anisotropy by oriented cell divisions\nis required to prevent EVL cells from fusing. We conclude that cell-division\norientation by tension constitutes a key mechanism for limiting tension\nanisotropy and thus promoting tissue spreading during EVL epiboly.\n",

The new constitutive law is used to model\nuniaxial extension test data for human patellar tendon and is shown to provide\nan excellent fit, with the average relative error being 9.8%. It is then used\nto model shear and predicts that the stresses required to shear a tendon are\nmuch smaller than those required to uniaxially stretch it to the same strain\nlevel. Finally, the strain energy function is used to model ligaments and\ntendons whose fascicles are helical, and the relative effects of the fibril\nhelix angle, the fascicle helix angle and the fibril crimp variable are\ncompared. It is shown that they all have a significant effect; the fibril crimp\nvariable governs the non-linearity of the stress-strain curve, whereas the\nhelix angles primarily affect its stiffness. Smaller values of the helix angles\nlead to stiffer tendons; therefore, the model predicts that one would expect to\nsee fewer helical sub-structures in stiff positional tendons, and more in those\nthat are required to be more flexible.\n",

We treat 1D and 2D tissues as\ncontinuous, deformable, growing geometries for sizes larger than 1mm. The\ndynamics of the growing tissue are described by a set of coupled tensor\nequations in non-Euclidean (curved) space. These coupled equations represent a\nnovel feedback mechanism between growth and curvature dynamics.\n  For 1D growth, numerical simulations are compared to two measures of root\ngrowth. First, modular growth along the simulated root shows an elongation zone\ncommon to many species of plant roots. Second, the relative elemental growth\nrate (REGR) calculated in silico exhibits temporal dynamics recently\ncharacterized in high-resolution root growth studies but which thus far lack a\nbiological hypothesis to explain them. Namely, the REGR can evolve from a\nsingle peak localized near the root tip to a double-peak structure. In our\nmodel, this is a direct consequence of considering growth as both a geometric\nreaction-diffusion process and expansion due to a distributed source of new\nmaterials.\n  In 2D, we study a circularly symmetric growing disk with emergent negative\ncurvatures. These results are compared against thin disk experiments, which are\na proxy model for plant leaves. These results also apply to the curvature\nevolution and the inhomogeneous growth pattern of the Acetabularia cap. Lastly,\nwe extend the model to anisotropic disks and predict the growth dynamics for a\n2D curved surface which develops an elongated shape with localized ruffling.\n  Our model also provides several measures of the dynamics of tissue growth.\nThese include the time evolution of the metric and velocity field, which are\ndynamical variables in the model, as well as expansion, shear and rotation\nwhich are deformation tensors characterizing the growth of the tissue.\n",

With a coarse-grained diffusion equation we determine\nstringent bounds, using parameters extracted from published experimental\nmeasurements of tendon development. From the lack of new fibril formation after\nbirth, we further require that the concentration of diffusing precursors stays\nbelow the critical concentration for fibril nucleation. We find that the\ncombination of the diffusive bound, which requires larger concentrations to\nensure homogeneous fibril radii, and lack of nucleation, which requires lower\nconcentrations, is only marginally consistent with fully-processed collagen\nusing conservative bounds. More realistic bounds may leave no consistent\nconcentrations. Therefore, we propose that unprocessed pC-collagen diffuses\nfrom the bundle periphery followed by local C-proteinase activity and\nsubsequent collagen incorporation at each fibril. We suggest that C-proteinase\nis localized within bundles, at fibril surfaces, during radial fibrillar\ngrowth. The much greater critical concentration of pC-collagen, as compared to\nfully-processed collagen, then provides broad consistency between homogeneous\nfibril radii and the lack of fibril nucleation during fibril growth.\n",

In these\nnetworks, the distribution of flow and pressure drop is a highly interlaced\nfunction of single vessel resistances and mutual vessel interactions. In this\npaper we propose a mathematical and computational model to study the behavior\nof microcirculatory networks subjected to different conditions. The network\ngeometry is composed of a graph of connected straight cylinders, each one\nrepresenting a vessel. The blood flow and pressure drop across the single\nvessel, further split into smaller elements, are related through a generalized\nOhm's law featuring a conductivity parameter, function of the vessel cross\nsection area and geometry, which undergo deformations under pressure loads. The\nmembrane theory is used to describe the deformation of vessel lumina, tailored\nto the structure of thick-walled arterioles and thin-walled venules. In\naddition, since venules can possibly experience negative transmural pressures,\na buckling model is also included to represent vessel collapse. The complete\nmodel including arterioles, capillaries and venules represents a nonlinear\nsystem of PDEs, which is approached numerically by finite element\ndiscretization and linearization techniques. We use the model to simulate flow\nin the microcirculation of the human eye retina, a terminal system with a\nsingle inlet and outlet. After a phase of validation against experimental\nmeasurements, we simulate the network response to different interstitial\npressure values. Such a study is carried out both for global and localized\nvariations of the interstitial pressure. In both cases, significant\nredistributions of the blood flow in the network arise, highlighting the\nimportance of considering the single vessel behavior along with its position\nand connectivity in the network.\n",

We implement the immersed\nboundary method with adaptive mesh refinement (IBAMR) to numerically study the\neffect of hematocrit on the circulation around a valveless.

In the case of dynamic suction\npumping, the heart and circulatory system is simplified as a flexible tube\nattached to a relatively rigid racetrack.

Recent studies\nof the intestinal crypt have revealed the existence of two stem cell groups.\nTherefore, our model incorporates two stem cell groups (central stem cells\n(CeSCs) and border stem cells (BSCs)), plus one compartment for transit\namplifying (TA) cells and one compartment of fully differentiated (FD) cells.\nHowever, it can be easily modified to have only one stem cell group. We find\nthat the worst-case scenario occurs when CeSCs are mutated, or an immortal cell\narises in the TA or FD compartments. The probability that the progeny of a\nsingle advantageous CeSC mutant will take over the entire crypt is more than\n$0.2$, and one immortal cell always causes all FD cells to become\nimmortals.Moreover, when CeSCs are either mutants or wild-type (w.t.)\nindividuals, their progeny will take over the entire crypt in less than 100\ndays if there is no immortal cell. Unexpectedly, if the CeSCs are wild-type,\nthen non-immortal mutants with higher fitness are washed out faster than those\nwith lower fitness.

It is mathematically very similar to\nsubcritical, or bypass, transition from laminar fluid flow to turbulence, which\nallows many of the tools developed in the context of fluid turbulence to be\nused for improving our understanding of cardiac arrhythmias.\n",

Qualitative considerations\nbased on Hofmeister-type action of these ions, as well as quantitative\nelectrochemical models for the Gibbs free-energy change for ion-pair formation\nare used to explain why Cd$^{2+}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and water hardness\ndue to Mg$^{2+}$ ions (but not Ca$^{2+}$) can be expected to be more\nnephrotoxic, while AsO$_3^{3-}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and hardness may be\nexpected to be less nephrotoxic. The analysis is applied to a variety of ionic\nspecies typically found in water to predict their likely combined\nelectro-chemical action. These results clarify the origins of chronic kidney\ndisease in the north-central province of Sri Lanka. The conclusion is further\nstrengthened by a study of the dietary load of Cd and As, where the dietary\nloads are found to be safe, especially when the mitigating effects of\nmicronutrient ionic forms of Zn and Se, as well as corrections for\nbio-availability are taken in to account. The resulting aetiological picture\nsupports the views that F$^-$, Cd$^{2+}$ (to a lesser extent), and Mg$^{2+}$\nions found in stagnant household well water act together with enhanced\ntoxicity, becoming the most likely causative factor of the disease. Similar\nincidence of CKDu found in other tropical climates may have similar geological\norigins.\n",

How can one explain such a key discrepancy in treatment progress?\nA statistical comparison between TB and cancer will give some clues. However,\nTB and cancer also share several important features. Both TB and cancer can\naffect several organs, e.g. lungs, brain, bones, intestines, skin. What in\ncancer is called malignant neoplasm (tumor) is called granuloma in TB. By\nisolating malignant cells (versus bacteria) from the rest of the body, such\nclusters protect the host's organism but at the same time they are \"secure\nbeachheads\" from where malignant cells (versus infected macrophages) can wander\noff to new locations. Thus, metastatic tumors have a TB parallel in the form of\nsecondary granulomas. In order to investigate more closely this parallel we use\nthe age-specific response of organs. Called spectrometric analysis in a\nprevious paper (Berrut et al. 2017), this method provides information about how\nfast tumors develop and how serious they become. A convenient characterization\nof the response to TB of organ j is given by the following (age-dependent)\ndeath ratio: Tj(t)=(death by TB of type j)/(all TB deaths) The development of\ncancer tumors can be described by a similar function Cj(t). We compare the\norgans' responses in all cases for which specific death data are available. It\nappears that for the same organ Tj(t) is similar in shape to Cj(t). For\ninstance, with regard to brain tumors, both TB and cancer mortality peak around\nthe age of 10. Such observations may bring to light vulnerabilities in the way\nthe immune system provides protection to various organs.\n",

Different mechanisms defined\nlargely by different atrial activation patterns have been proposed and,\narguably, this dispute has slowed the progress of AF research. Recent clinical\nevidence suggests a unifying mechanism based on sustained re-entrant circuits\nin the complex atrial architecture. Here, we present a simple computational\nmodel showing spontaneous emergence of AF that strongly supports, and gives a\ntheoretical explanation for, the clinically observed diversity of activation.\nWe show that the difference in surface activation patterns is a direct\nconsequence of the thickness of the discrete network of heart muscle cells\nthrough which electrical signals percolate to reach the imaged surface. The\nmodel naturally follows the clinical spectrum of AF spanning sinus rhythm,\nparoxysmal and persistent AF as the decoupling of myocardial cells results in\nthe lattice approaching the percolation threshold. This allows the model to\nmake additional predictions beyond the current clinical understanding, showing\nthat for paroxysmal AF re-entrant circuits emerge near the endocardium, but in\npersistent AF they emerge deeper in the bulk of the atrial wall where\nendocardial ablation is less effective. If clinically confirmed, this may\nexplain the lower success rate of ablation in long-lasting persistent AF.\n",

The aortic valve plays a critical\nrole in heart failure and its treatment with LVAD. The cardiovascular-LVAD\nmodel is often used to investigate the physiological demands required by\npatients and predict the hemodynamic of the native heart supported with a LVAD.\nAs a bridge to recovery treatment, it is important to maintain appropriate and\nactive dynamics of the aortic valve and the cardiac output of the native heart,\nwhich requires that the LVAD pump must be adjusted so that a proper balance\nbetween the blood contributed through the aortic valve and the pump is\nmaintained. In this paper, our objective is to identify a critical value of the\npump power to ensure that the LVAD pump does not take over the pumping function\nin the cardiovascular-pump system and share the ejected blood with left\nventricle to help the heart to recover. In addition, hemodynamic often involves\nvariability due to patients heterogeneity and the stochastic nature of\ncardiovascular system. The variability poses significant challenges to\nunderstand dynamic behaviors of the aortic valve and cardiac output. A\ngeneralized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion is used in this work to develop a\nstochastic cardiovascular-pump model for efficient uncertainty propagation,\nfrom which it is possible to rapidly calculate the variance in the aortic valve\nopening duration and the cardiac output in the presence of variability. The\nsimulation results show that the gPC based cardiovascular-pump model is a\nreliable platform that can provide useful information to understand the effect\nof LVAD pump on the hemodynamic of the heart.\n",

This\nstudy shows: to understand how cardiovascular system models can be used to\nrepresent a patient's cardiovascular state, and to use these models to track\npost-transplant recovery and outcome. To obtain reliable parameter estimates\ncomparable within and across datasets, we use sensitivity analysis, parameter\nsubset selection, and optimization to determine patient specific mechanistic\nparameter that can be reliably extracted from the RHC data. Patient-specific\nmodels are identified for ten patients from their first post-transplant RHC and\nlongitudinal analysis is done for five patients. Results of sensitivity\nanalysis and subset selection show we can reliably estimate seven\nnon-measurable quantities including ventricular diastolic relaxation, systemic\nresistance, pulmonary venous elastance, pulmonary resistance, pulmonary\narterial elastance, pulmonary valve resistance and systemic arterial elastance.\nChanges in parameters and predicted cardiovascular function post-transplant are\nused to evaluate cardiovascular state during recovery in five patients. Of\nthese five patients, only one patient showed inconsistent trends during\nrecovery in ventricular pressure-volume relationships and power output. At a\nfour-year recovery time point this patient exhibited biventricular failure\nalong with graft dysfunction while the remaining four exhibited no\ncardiovascular complications.\n",

We disclose that\nthey are generally low scattering in the core using Micro-optical coherence\ntomography (micro-OCT) of 1.28 um axial resolution in vivo; those previously\nreported high scattering or bright signals from nuclei are likely from the\nnucleocytoplasmic boundary, and the low-scattering nuclear cores were missed\npossibly due to insufficient axial resolutions (about 4 um).

While the Fisher--KPP model and extensions\nhave been successfully used to model a range of invasive phenomena, including\necological and cellular invasion, an often--overlooked limitation of the\nFisher--KPP model is that it cannot be used to model biological recession where\nthe spatial extent of the population decreases with time. In this work we study\nthe \\textit{Fisher--Stefan} model, which is a generalisation of the Fisher--KPP\nmodel obtained by reformulating the Fisher--KPP model as a moving boundary\nproblem. The nondimensional Fisher--Stefan model involves just one single\nparameter, $\\kappa$, which relates the shape of the density front at the moving\nboundary to the speed of the associated travelling wave, $c$. Using numerical\nsimulation, phase plane and perturbation analysis, we construct approximate\nsolutions of the Fisher--Stefan model for both slowly invading and slowly\nreceding travelling waves, as well as for rapidly receding travelling waves.\nThese approximations allow us to determine the relationship between $c$ and\n$\\kappa$ so that commonly--reported experimental estimates of $c$ can be used\nto provide estimates of the unknown parameter $\\kappa$. Interestingly, when we\nreinterpret the Fisher--KPP model as a moving boundary problem, many\ndisregarded features of the classical Fisher--KPP phase plane take on a new\ninterpretation since travelling waves solutions with $c < 2$ are not normally\nconsidered. This means that our analysis of the Fisher--Stefan model has both\npractical value and an inherent mathematical value.\n",

An underlying assumption is that irradiation of\nabout 1 Gy is effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. Its rationale,\nhowever, relies on early human case series or animal studies mostly obtained in\nthe pre-antibiotic era, where rigorous statistical analyses were not performed.\nIt therefore remains unclear whether those early data support such assumptions.\nWith standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature\nreview, we re-analyzed 14 radiobiological animal datasets in which animals\nreceived mostly fractionated doses of radiation before or after bacterial/viral\ninoculation, and assessing various health endpoints (mortality, pneumonia\nmorbidity). In most datasets absorbed doses did not exceed 7 Gy. Various\ndifferent model systems and types of challenging infection are considered. For\n7 studies that evaluated post-inoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to\nLDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with 2 studies\nshowing a significant increase (p<0.001) and another showing a significant\ndecrease (p<0.001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. For\npre-inoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with 6 datasets\nshowing a significant increase (p<0.01) in mortality risk associated with\nradiation exposure and the other 2 showing a significant decrease (p<0.05) in\nmortality risk. Collectively, these data do not provide clear support for\nreductions in morbidity or mortality associated with post-infection radiation\nexposure. For pre-infection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction\nof effect makes this body of data difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, one\nmust be cautious about adducing evidence from the published reports of these\nold animal datasets.\n",

It is a puzzling question. Furthermore, shear stress of veins\nis similar to that of Relatively Vulnerable Zones (RVZ) of arteries, while\nintimal thickening of veins is not obvious as the arteries. There are many\nplaces in arterioles with lower shear stress as the decrease of blood velocity,\nwhile the thickening of arterioles is not as obvious as that of the\nmedium-sized arteries. These issues make it unconvincing for us to explain\natherogenesis with lower shear stress. According to Bernoulli fluid equation\n(P+1/2\\r{ho}v^2+\\r{ho}gh=constant), in a closed pipe full of flowing blood, at\nthe same height, the hydrostatic pressure is inversely proportional to the\nsecond power of blood velocity. At any point of per unit mass of fluid micro\ncluster here, the reduction of 1/2\\r{ho}v^2 would be converted into P.\nTherefore, hydrostatic pressure(P) is inversely proportional to v^2 in a very\nshort distance or in the same transection of the artery. When blood micro\ncluster flows over a very short distance or the same transection of the artery,\nprevious studies did not consider the conversion between 1/2\\r{ho}v^2 and P.\nTherefore, low shear stress aggravates atherosclerosis is an appearance, and\nthe essence is that these areas with smaller blood velocity have much bigger\nhydrostatic pressure, which aggravates atherosclerosis. This perfectly explains\nthe predisposing sites of atherosclerosis.\n",

We show that pressure\nfeedbacks created when red blood cells enter the finest vessels of the trunk\nact together to uniformly partition red blood cells through the\nmicrovasculature. Using mathematical models as well as direct observation, we\nshow that these occlusive feedbacks are tuned throughout the trunk network to\nprevent the vessels closest to the heart from short-circuiting the network.\nThus occlusion is linked with another open question of microvascular function:\nhow are red blood cells delivered at the same rate to each micro-vessel? Our\nanalysis shows that tuning of occlusive feedbacks increase the total\ndissipation within the network by a factor of 11, showing that uniformity of\nflows rather than minimization of transport costs may be prioritized by the\nmicrovascular network.\n",

Anatomical changes following traumatic brain injury are\nsimulated at the macroscale by using a 3D head model. Frontal head impacts at\nspeeds of 2.5-7.5 m/s induce mild-to-moderate DAI in the white matter of the\nbrain. Investigation of the changes in induced electromechanical responses at\nthe cellular level is carried out in two scaled nerve bundle models, one with\nmyelinated nerve fibres, the other with unmyelinated nerve fibres. DAI\noccurrence is simulated by using a real-time fully coupled electromechanical\nframework, which combines a modulated threshold for spiking activation and\nindependent alteration of the electrical properties for each three-layer fibre\nin the nerve bundle models. The magnitudes of simulated strains in the white\nmatter of the brain model are used to determine the displacement boundary\nconditions in elongation simulations using the 3D nerve bundle models. At high\nimpact speed, mechanical failure occurs at lower strain values in large\nunmyelinated bundles than in myelinated bundles or small unmyelinated bundles;\nsignal propagation continues in large myelinated bundles during and after\nloading, although there is a large shift in baseline voltage during loading; a\nlinear relationship is observed between the generated plastic strain in the\nnerve bundle models and the impact speed and nominal strains of the head model.\nThe myelin layer protects the fibre from mechanical damage, preserving its\nfunctionalities.\n",

Among many structural changes, a thin\nlayer of highly mineralized and brittle tissue covers part of the external\nsurface of the thin femoral neck cortex in older people and has been proposed\nto increase hip fragility. However, there have been very limited reports on\nthis hypermineralized tissue in the femoral neck, especially on its\nultrastructure. Such information is critical to understanding both the\nmineralization process and its contributions to hip fracture. Here, we use\nmultiple advanced techniques to characterize the ultrastructure of the\nhypermineralized tissue in the neck across various length scales. Synchrotron\nradiation micro-CT found larger but less densely distributed cellular lacunae\nin hypermineralized tissue than in lamellar bone. When examined under FIB-SEM,\nthe hypermineralized tissue was mainly composed of mineral globules with sizes\nvarying from submicron to a few microns. Nano-sized channels were present\nwithin the mineral globules and oriented with the surrounding organic matrix.\nTransmission electron microscopy showed the apatite inside globules were poorly\ncrystalline, while those at the boundaries between the globules had\nwell-defined lattice structure with crystallinity similar to the apatite\nmineral in lamellar bone. No preferred mineral orientation was observed both\ninside each globule and at the boundaries. Collectively, we conclude based on\nthese new observations that the hypermineralized tissue is non-lamellar and has\nless organized mineral, which may contribute to the high brittleness of the\ntissue.\n",

The labeled cell images were used to train the CNN (obtaining an\naccuracy of 92% in a test set). The trained CNN is then extended to an FCN that\ngenerates a map of all biomarkers in the whole slide image acquired by the\nscanner (instead of classifying every cell image). To evaluate our method, we\nmanually labeled all nuclei expressing different biomarkers in two whole slide\nimages and used theses as the ground truth.

This understanding is likely to assist in the development of\nbetter diagnostics, improved therapies and prognostics. In biological systems,\nmost of the diffusive and convective processes are through cellular membranes\nwhich are porous in nature. Due to its porous nature, diffusive processes in\nbiological systems are heterogeneous. Fractional advection-diffusion equations\nare well suited to model heterogeneous biological systems; though most of the\nearly studies did not use this fact. They modelled tumour growth with simple\nadvection-diffusion equation or diffusion equation. We have developed two\nspherical models based on fractional advection-diffusion equations: one of\nfixed order and the other of variable order for avascular tumour. These two\nmodels are investigated from phenomenological view by measuring some parameters\nfor characterizing avascular tumour growth over time. It is found that both the\nmodels offer realistic and insightful information for tumour growth at the\nmacroscopic level, and approximate well the physical phenomena. The fixed-order\nmodel always overestimates clinical data like tumour radius, and tumour volume.\nThe cell counts in both the models lie in the clinically established range. As\nthe simulation parameters get modified due to different biochemical and\nbiophysical processes, the robustness of the model is determined.

In order to disentangle the impact of different\nevolutionary parameters on the emergence of intra-tumour phenotypic\nheterogeneity and the development of resistance to chemotherapy, we construct\nexplicit solutions to the equation for the phenotypic distribution of tumour\ncells and provide a detailed quantitative characterisation of the long-time\nasymptotic behaviour of such solutions.

Nematic order in these simulated networks implies anisotropic\ntransport properties, characterized by an empirical linear relation between a\nnematic order parameter and the anisotropy of the permeability tensor. Under\nthe assumption that all sinusoid tubes have a constant and equal flow\nresistance, we predict that the distribution of currents in the network is very\ninhomogeneous, with a small number of edges carrying a substantial part of the\nflow. We quantify network resilience in terms of a permeability-at-risk, i.e.\\\npermeability as function of the fraction of removed edges.

Some studies have recently\nconsidered the positive role of cohesiveness, but there is still an\ninsufficient understanding of the effect of the rheological properties of the\nliquid bolus on the dynamics of bolus transport, particularly when elasticity\nand extensional properties are combined with a shear thinning behaviour. This\nstudy combines steady shear, SAOS and capillary breakage extensional rheometry\nwith an in vitro method to characterize the oral transport of elastic liquids.\nBolus velocity and bolus length were measured from in vitro experiments using\nimage analysis and related to the shear and extensional properties. A theory\ndescribing the bolus dynamics shows that the elastic and extensional properties\ndo not influence significantly the oral transit dynamics. Conversely, in vitro\nresults suggest that the extensional properties can affect the transition from\nthe oral to the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, where thin, viscoelastic\nliquids lead to a fast transit, lower oral post-swallow residues and more\ncompact bolus with a smoother surface, which may suggest a lower risk of\nfragmentation.

        "summary": "  The recent discovery of bone flexoelectricity (electrical polarization\ninduced by strain gradient) suggests that flexoelectricity could have\nphysiological effects in bones, and specifically near bone fractures, where\nflexoelectricity is theoretically highest. Here, we report a cytological study\nof the interaction between crack stress and bone cells. We have cultured\nMC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells in biomimetic microcracked hydroxyapatite\nsubstrates, differentiated into osteocytes and applied a strain gradient to the\nsamples. The results show a strong apoptotic cellular response, whereby\nmechanical stimulation causes those cells near the crack to die, as indicated\nby live-dead and caspase staining. In addition, analysis two weeks after\nstimulation shows increased cell attachment and mineralization around\nmicrocracks and a higher expression of osteocalcin, an osteogenic protein known\nto be promoted by physical exercise. The results are consistent with\nflexoelectricity playing at least two different roles in bone remodelling:\napoptotic trigger of the repair protocol, and electrostimulant of the\nbone-building activity of osteoblasts.\n",

        "summary": "  Strokes are still one of the leading causes for death after heart diseases\nand cancer in all over the world. Most strokes happen because an artery that\ncarries blood uphill from the heart to the head gets clogged. Most of the time,\nas with heart attacks, the problem is atherosclerosis, hardening of the\narteries, calcified buildup of fatty deposits on the vessel wall. The primary\ntroublemaker is the carotid artery, one on each side of the neck, the main\nthoroughfare for blood to the brain. Only within the last 25 years, though,\nhave researchers been able to put their finger on why the carotid is especially\nsusceptible to atherosclerosis. In this study, the fluid dynamic simulations\nwere done in a carotid bifurcation under the steady flow conditions\ncomputationally. In vivo geometry and boundary conditions were obtained from a\ndiseased who has both sides of stenosis located in his carotid artery patients.\nThe location of critical flow fields such as low wall shear stress (WSS),\nstagnation regions and separation regions were detected. Low WSS was found at\nthe downstream of the bifurcation.\n",

This investigation focuses on the photothermal\ninteraction for which a computer model is used to simulate the thermal behavior\nof the retina and to predict the injury threshold values. The most important\nfactors are the wavelength of the radiation, the exposure time and the\nirradiance profile on the retina. For performing safety evaluations and\nclassifications the laser safety standard IEC 60825-1:2014 has to be\nconsidered. These evaluations are based on emission limits which depend on the\nsame above mentioned factors. According to the IEC 60825-1:2014, non-uniform\nretinal images are treated by an image analysis where an averaged spot size is\nused. This averaged size is calculated by the extent of the irradiance profile\nalong two orthogonal directions. Unlike the laser safety standard, the computer\nmodel predicts the injury thresholds for an irradiance profile on the retina\nwithout averaging the spot size. In this investigation, a broad variety of\nnon-uniform retinal images is investigated with regard to the injury thresholds\npredicted by the computer model and to the classifications according to the\nlaser safety standard.\n",

We hypothesized that bumpy tissue geometry can induce\naction potential duration (APD) dispersion and wavebreak in atrial fibrillation\n(AF).\n  Methods and Results: We simulated 2D-bumpy atrial model by varying the degree\nof bumpiness, and 3D-left atrial (LA) models integrated by LA computed\ntomographic (CT) images taken from 14 patients with persistent AF. We also\nanalyzed wave-dynamic parameters with bipolar electrograms during AF and\ncompared them with LA-CT geometry in 30 patients with persistent AF. In\n2D-bumpy model, APD dispersion increased (p<0.001) and wavebreak occurred\nspontaneously when the surface bumpiness was higher, showing phase\ntransition-like behavior (p<0.001). Bumpiness gradient 2D-model showed that\nspiral wave drifted in the direction of higher bumpiness, and phase singularity\n(PS) points were mostly located in areas with higher bumpiness. In 3D-LA model,\nPS density was higher in LA appendage (LAA) compared to other LA parts\n(p<0.05). In 30 persistent AF patients, the surface bumpiness of LAA was\n5.8-times that of other LA parts (p<0.001), and exceeded critical bumpiness to\ninduce wavebreak.

Clonal expansion\nrate increases non-linearly by radon concentration showing a plateau above a\ngiven exposure rate. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Earlier we\nproposed that progenitor cell hyperplasia may be induced upon chronic radon\nexposure. The objective of the present study is to test whether the induction\nof hyperplasia may provide a quantitative explanation for the plateau in clonal\nexpansion rate. For this purpose, numerical epithelium models were prepared\nwith different number of basal cells. Cell nucleus hits were computed by an\nown-developed Monte-Carlo code. Surviving fractions were estimated based on the\nnumber of cell nucleus hits. Cell division rate was computed supposing\nequilibrium between cell death and cell division. It was also supposed that\nclonal expansion rate is proportional to cell division rate, and therefore the\nrelative increase in cell division rate and clonal expansion rate are the same\nfunctions of exposure rate. While the simulation results highly depend on model\nparameters with high uncertainty, a parameter set has been found resulting in a\ncell division rate exposure rate relationship corresponding to the plateau in\nclonal expansion rate. Due to the high uncertainty of the applied parameters,\nhowever, further studies are required to decide whether the induction of\nhyperplasia is responsible for the non-linear increase in clonal expansion rate\nor not. Nevertheless the present study exemplifies how computational modelling\ncan contribute to the integration of observational and experimental radiation\nprotection research.\n",

These factors diffuse through the\nextracellular matrix (ECM) and degrade the basement membrane of nearby\nvasculature. The TAFs also disrupt the corresponding endothelial cell receptors\nand form finger like capillary sprouts. These factors also create a chemical\ngradient (chemotaxis) between the tumour and the surrounding blood vessels. Due\nto the chemotactic force, the capillary sprouts migrate towards the tumour. On\nthe other hand, a haptotactic force generated due to fibronectin which is\nsecreted by the endothelial cell, also acts on these sprouts. These sprouts\ngrow through the proliferation of recruited endothelial cells from the parent\nvessels. Tumour angiogenesis is not fully understood yet. In this paper, we use\n2-D cellular automata (CA) model to study the behavior of tumour angiogenesis\nusing both Moore and von-Neumann neighborhood. The CA model also mimics\ncapillary sprout branching and the fusion of two adjacent sprout tips\n(anastomoses). In this simulation, a couple of important points are noted: a)\nno two capillary sprouts are generated from adjacent locations; b) as the\nsprouts approach closer to the tumour, its branching tendency increases; c)\nchemotaxis is the most effective driving force for angiogenesis.\n",

In clinical\npractice, AF is classified under two primary categories: paroxysmal AF, short\nintermittent episodes separated by periods of normal electrical activity, and\npersistent AF, longer uninterrupted episodes of chaotic electrical activity.\nHowever, the precise reasons why AF in a given patient is paroxysmal or\npersistent is poorly understood. Recently, we have introduced the percolation\nbased Christensen-Manani-Peters (CMP) model of AF which naturally exhibits both\nparoxysmal and persistent AF, but precisely how these differences emerge in the\nmodel is unclear. In this paper, we dissect the CMP model to identify the cause\nof these different AF classifications. Starting from a mean-field model where\nwe describe AF as a simple birth-death process, we add layers of complexity to\nthe model and show that persistent AF arises from re-entrant circuits which\nexhibit an asymmetry in their probability of activation relative to\ndeactivation. As a result, different simulations generated at identical model\nparameters can exhibit fibrillatory episodes spanning several orders of\nmagnitude from a few seconds to months. These findings demonstrate that\ndiverse, complex fibrillatory dynamics can emerge from very simple dynamics in\nmodels of AF.\n",

Exploiting a separation of timescales in the model, we use the method of\nmatched asymptotics to derive a new two-dimensional, long-timescale,\napproximation of the full model, which differs from the quasi-steady-state\napproximation introduced by Kuznetsov et al. (1994), but is validated against\nnumerical solutions of the full model. Through a phase-plane analysis, we show\nthat our reduced model is excitable, a feature not traditionally associated\nwith tumour-immune dynamics. Through a systematic parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, we demonstrate that excitability generates complex bifurcating\ndynamics in the model. These are consistent with a variety of clinically\nobserved phenomena, and suggest that excitability may underpin tumour-immune\ninteractions. The model exhibits the three stages of immunoediting -\nelimination, equilibrium, and escape, via stable steady states with different\ntumour cell concentrations. Such heterogeneity in tumour cell numbers can stem\nfrom variability in initial conditions and/or model parameters that control the\nproperties of the immune system and its response to the tumour. We identify\ndifferent biophysical parameter targets that could be manipulated with\nimmunotherapy in order to control tumour size, and we find that preferred\nstrategies may differ between patients depending on the strength of their\nimmune systems, as determined by patient-specific values of associated model\nparameters.\n",

        "summary": "  Muscles sense internally generated and externally applied forces, responding\nto these in a coordinated hierarchical manner at different time scales. The\ncenter of the basic unit of the muscle, the sarcomeric M-band, is perfectly\nplaced to sense the different types of load to which the muscle is subjected.\nIn particular, the kinase domain (TK) of titin located at the M-band is a known\ncandidate for mechanical signaling. Here, we develop the quantitative\nmathematical model that describes the kinetics of TK-based mechanosensitive\nsignaling, and predicts trophic changes in response to exercise and\nrehabilitation regimes. First, we build the kinetic model for TK conformational\nchanges under force: opening, phosphorylation, signaling and autoinhibition. We\nfind that TK opens as a metastable mechanosensitive switch, which naturally\nproduces a much greater signal after high-load resistance exercise than an\nequally energetically costly endurance effort. Next, in order for the model to\nbe stable, give coherent predictions, in particular the lag following the onset\nof an exercise regime, we have to account for the associated kinetics of\nphosphate (carried by ATP), and for the non-linear dependence of protein\nsynthesis rates on muscle fibre size. We suggest that the latter effect may\noccur via the steric inhibition of ribosome diffusion through the sieve-like\nmyofilament lattice. The full model yields a steady-state solution\n(homeostasis) for muscle cross-sectional area and tension, and a quantitatively\nplausible hypertrophic response to training as well as atrophy following an\nextended reduction in tension.\n",

By means of modifying TEOS/APTES ratio\nwe have carried out an in-depth characterization of the nanoparticles as a\nfunction of APTES content. Surface charge and nanoparticles morphology were\nstrongly influenced by the amount of APTES and particles changed from hexagonal\nto bean-like morphology insofar APTES increased. Besides, the porous structure\nwas also affected, showing a contraction of the lattice parameter and pore\nsize, while increasing the wall thickness. These results bring about new\ninsights about the nanoparticles formation during the co-condensation process.\nThe model proposed herein considers that different interactions stablished\nbetween TEOS and APTES with the structure directing agent have consequences on\npore size, wall thickness and particle morphology. Finally, APTES is an\nexcellent linker to covalently attach active targeting agents such as folate\ngroups. We have hypothesized that APTES could also play a role in the\nbiological behavior of the nanoparticles. So, the internalization efficiency of\nthe nanoparticles has been tested with cancerous LNCaP and non-cancerous\npreosteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells.

Standard commercial\ncontrast agents used in angiography are not suitable for high-resolution\nimaging ex vivo, however, as they are small molecular compounds capable of\ndiffusing through blood vessel walls within minutes. Large nanoparticle-based\nblood pool contrast agents on the other hand exhibit problems with aggregation,\nresulting in clogging in the smallest blood vessels. Injection with solidifying\nplastic resins has, therefore, remained the gold standard for microvascular\nimaging, despite the considerable amount of training and optimization needed to\nproperly perfuse the viscous compounds. Even with optimization, frequent gas\nand water inclusions commonly result in interrupted vessel segments. This lack\nof suitable compounds has led us to develop the polymeric, cross-linkable X-ray\ncontrast agent XlinCA. As a water-soluble organic molecule, aggregation and\ninclusions are inherently avoided. High molecular weight allows it to be\nretained even in the highly fenestrated vasculature of the kidney filtration\nsystem. It can be covalently crosslinked using the same aldehydes used in\ntissue fixation protocols, leading to stable and permanent contrast. These\nproperties allowed us to image whole mice and individual organs in 6 to\n12-month-old C57BL/6J mice without requiring lengthy optimizations of injection\nrates and pressures, while at the same time achieving greatly improved filling\nof the vasculature compared to resin-based vascular casting. This work aims at\nilluminating the rationales, processes and challenges involved in creating this\nrecently developed contrast agent.\n",

The\ntime-dependent mechanical properties of soft tissues influence their\nphysiological functions and are linked to several pathological processes.\nPoro-elastic modeling represents a promising approach because it allows the\nintegration of multiscale/multiphysics data to probe biologically relevant\nphenomena at a smaller scale and embeds the relevant mechanisms at the larger\nscale. The implementation of multi-phasic flow poro-elastic models however is a\ncomplex undertaking, requiring extensive knowledge. The open-source software\nFEniCSx Project provides a novel tool for the automated solution of partial\ndifferential equations by the finite element method. This paper aims to provide\nthe required tools to model the mixed formulation of poro-elasticity, from the\ntheory to the implementation, within FEniCSx. Several benchmark cases are\nstudied. A column under confined compression conditions is compared to the\nTerzaghi analytical solution, using the L2-norm. An implementation of\nporo-hyper-elasticity is proposed. A bi-compartment column is compared to\npreviously published results (Cast3m implementation). For all cases, accurate\nresults are obtained in terms of a normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\nFurthermore, the FEniCSx computation is found three times faster than the\nlegacy FEniCS one.

The model is generally solved using a numerical\ntechnique such as the finite element model. Conversely, one may be interested\nin the loads that have resulted in a given state of bone. This is the inverse\nof the former problem. Even though the inverse problem has several\napplications, it has not received as much attention as the forward problem,\npartly because solving the inverse problem is more difficult. A nonlinear\nsystem identification technique is needed for solving the inverse problem. In\nthis study, we use artificial neural networks for prediction of tissue\nadaptation loads from a given density distribution of trabecular bone. It is\nshown that the proposed method can successfully identify the loading parameters\nfrom the density distribution of the tissue. Two important challenges for all\nload prediction algorithms are the non-uniqueness of the solution of the\ninverse problem and the inaccuracies in the measurement of the morphology of\nthe tissue. Both challenges are studied, and it is shown that the load\nprediction technique proposed in this paper can overcome both.\n",

What is often neglected is that\ncytotoxic cells of the immune system also have increased energy demands and\nalso switch to pure glycolysis when they are in an activated state. Moreover,\nwhile cancer cells can revert back to aerobic metabolism, rapidly proliferating\ncytotoxic lymphocytes are incapable of performing their function when adequate\nresources are lacking. Consequently, in the tumor microenvironment there must\nexist competition for the common resources between cancer cells and the cells\nof the immune system, which may drive a lot of the tumor-immune dynamics.\nProposed here is a model of tumor-immune-glucose interactions, formulated as a\npredator-prey-common resource type system, which allows to investigate possible\ndynamical behaviors that may arise as a result of competition for glucose,\nincluding tumor elimination, tumor dormancy and unrestrained tumor growth.\n",

However, in another range of parameters,\nwe observe a transition from ST to RS states in both 2D or 3D domains and for\nboth cases (a) and (b). Our studies show that the ST-RS transition and rotation\nperiod of a spiral or scroll wave in the RS state depends on (i) the coupling\nstrength between myocytes and fibroblasts and (ii) the number of fibroblasts\nattached to myocytes.

However,\nthe time intervals between consecutive computerized tomography scans might be\ntoo long to allow early identification of treatment failure. This study\nexamines the use of breath sampling to monitor responses to anticancer\ntreatments in patients with advanced lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 143\nbreath samples were collected from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer. The\nexhaled breath signature, determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\nand a nanomaterial-based array of sensors, was correlated with the response to\ntherapy assessed by RECIST: complete response, partial response, stable\ndisease, or progressive disease. RESULTS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\nanalysis identified three volatile organic compounds as significantly\nindicating disease control (PR/stable disease), with one of them also\nsignificantly discriminating PR/stable disease from progressive disease. The\nnanoarray had the ability to monitor changes in tumor response across therapy,\nalso indicating any lack of further response to therapy. When one-sensor\nanalysis was used, 59% of the follow-up samples were identified correctly.\nThere was 85% success in monitoring disease control (stable disease/partial\nresponse). CONCLUSION: Breath analysis, using mainly the nanoarray, may serve\nas a surrogate marker for the response to systemic therapy in lung cancer. As a\nmonitoring tool, it can provide the oncologist with a quick bedside method of\nidentifying a lack of response to an anticancer treatment. This may allow\nquicker recognition than does the current RECIST analysis. Early recognition of\ntreatment failure could improve patient care.\n",

        "summary": "  The accurate assessment of White matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden is of\ncrucial importance for epidemiological studies to determine association between\nWMHs, cognitive and clinical data. The manual delineation of WMHs is tedious,\ncostly and time consuming. This is further complicated by the fact that other\npathological features (i.e. stroke lesions) often also appear as hyperintense.\nSeveral automated methods aiming to tackle the challenges of WMH segmentation\nhave been proposed, however cannot differentiate between WMH and strokes. Other\nmethods, capable of distinguishing between different pathologies in brain MRI,\nare not designed with simultaneous WMH and stroke segmentation in mind. In this\nwork we propose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is able to\nsegment hyperintensities and differentiate between WMHs and stroke lesions.\nSpecifically, we aim to distinguish between WMH pathologies from those caused\nby stroke lesions due to either cortical, large or small subcortical infarcts.\nAs far as we know, this is the first time such differentiation task has\nexplicitly been proposed. The proposed fully convolutional CNN architecture, is\ncomprised of an analysis path, that gradually learns low and high level\nfeatures, followed by a synthesis path, that gradually combines and up-samples\nthe low and high level features into a class likelihood semantic segmentation.\nQuantitatively, the proposed CNN architecture is shown to outperform other well\nestablished and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overlap with manual\nexpert annotations. Clinically, the extracted WMH volumes were found to\ncorrelate better with the Fazekas visual rating score. Additionally, a\ncomparison of the associations found between clinical risk-factors and the WMH\nvolumes generated by the proposed method, were found to be in line with the\nassociations found with the expert-annotated volumes.\n",

Even\nthough dermatologists are trained to recognize patterns of morphology, it is\nstill a subjective visual assessment. Tools for automated pattern recognition\ncan provide objective information to support clinical decision-making.\nNoninvasive skin imaging techniques provide complementary information to the\nclinician. In recent years, optical coherence tomography has become a powerful\nskin imaging technique. According to specific functional needs, skin\narchitecture varies across different parts of the body, as do the textural\ncharacteristics in OCT images.

Sixty-three optical and\ntextural features extracted from OCT images of healthy and diseased skin are\nanalyzed and in conjunction with decision-theoretic approaches used to create\ncomputational models of the diseases. We demonstrate that these models provide\nobjective information to the clinician to assist in the diagnosis of\nabnormalities of cutaneous microstructure, and hence, aid in the determination\nof treatment.

The results show that when breast cancer cells were cultured\nin the microenvironments they had a 2.62-fold higher vessel porosity relative\nto vessels within healthy liver microenvironments.

        "summary": "  Local cancer cell invasion is a complex process involving many cellular and\ntissue interactions and is an important prerequisite for metastatic spread, the\nmain cause of cancer related deaths. Occurring over many different temporal and\nspatial scales, the first stage of local invasion is the secretion of\nmatrix-degrading enzymes (MDEs) and the resulting degradation of the\nextra-cellular matrix (ECM). This process creates space in which the cells can\ninvade and thus enlarge the tumour. As a tumour increases in malignancy, the\ncancer cells adopt the ability to mutate into secondary cell subpopulations\ngiving rise to a heterogeneous tumour. This new cell subpopulation often\ncarries higher invasive qualities and permits a quicker spread of the tumour.\nBuilding upon the recent multiscale modelling framework for cancer invasion\nwithin a fibrous ECM introduced in Shuttleworth and Trucu (2019), in this paper\nwe consider the process of local invasion by a heterotypic tumour consisting of\ntwo cancer cell populations mixed with a two-phase ECM. To that end, we address\nthe double feedback link between the tissue-scale cancer dynamics and the\ncell-scale molecular processes through the development of a two-part modelling\nframework that crucially incorporates the multiscale dynamic redistribution of\noriented fibres occurring within a two-phase extra-cellular matrix and combines\nthis with the multiscale leading edge dynamics exploring key matrix-degrading\nenzymes molecular processes along the tumour interface that drive the movement\nof the cancer boundary. The modelling framework will be accompanied by\ncomputational results that explore the effects of the underlying fibre network\non the overall pattern of cancer invasion.\n",

Occurring over many different temporal\nand spatial scales, the first stage of invasion is the secretion of matrix\ndegrading enzymes (MDEs) by the cancer cells that consequently degrade the\nsurrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). This process is vital for creating\nspace in which the cancer cells can progress and it is driven by the activities\nof specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this paper, we consider the\nkey role of two MMPs by developing further the novel two-part multiscale model\nintroduced in [33] to better relate at micro-scale the two micro-scale\nactivities that were considered there, namely, the micro-dynamics concerning\nthe continuous rearrangement of the naturally oriented ECM fibres within the\nbulk of the tumour and MDEs proteolytic micro-dynamics that take place in an\nappropriate cell-scale neighbourhood of the tumour boundary. Focussing\nprimarily on the activities of the membrane-tethered MT1-MMP and the soluble\nMMP-2 with the fibrous ECM phase, in this work we investigate the MT1-MMP/MMP-2\ncascade and its overall effect on tumour progression. To that end, we will\npropose a new multiscale modelling framework by considering the degradation of\nthe ECM fibres not only to take place at macro-scale in the bulk of the tumour\nbut also explicitly in the micro-scale neighbourhood of the tumour interface as\na consequence of the interactions with molecular fluxes of MDEs that exercise\ntheir spatial dynamics at the invasive edge of the tumour.\n",

We\nsuggest the way how to extract numerical values from the experimental data\nassociated with PS properties.\n  Methods: The operating principle of ESAT is based on the electrostatic\nprecipitation of exhaled particles. The native material was collected directly\non the water surface, where an accumulated adsorbed film of PS was examined\nwith tensiometric method. The modified capillary waves method adapted to study\nsmall volume samples was utilized. The efficiency of the setup was verified in\nthe experiments with healthy subjects.\n  Conclusion: The accumulation of PS components on the water surface in an\namount sufficient for tensiometric study was reported.

Mathematical modeling\nand simulation is a promising approach to personalized cancer medicine. Yet,\nthe complexity, heterogeneity and multiscale nature of cancer present severe\nchallenges. One of the major barriers to use mathematical models to predict the\noutcome of therapeutic regimens in a particular patient lies in their\ninitialization and parameterization in order to reflect individual cancer\ncharacteristics accurately. Here we present a study where we used multitype\nmeasurements acquired routinely on a single breast tumor, including\nhistopathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and molecular profiling, to\npersonalize a multiscale hybrid cellular automaton model of breast cancer\ntreated with chemotherapeutic and antiangiogenic agents.

Classical hypotheses for atherosclerosis are\nlong-standing mainly to explain atherogenesis. Unfortunately, these hypotheses\nmay not explain the variation in the susceptibility to atherosclerosis. These\nissues are controversial over the past 150 years. Atherosclerosis from human\ncoronary arteries was examined and triangle of media was found to be a true\nportraiture of cells injury in the media, and triangle of intima was a true\nportraiture of myofibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM)\nsecretion, collagen fiber formation and intimal thickening to repair media\ndysfunction. Myofibroblasts, ECM and lumen (intima)/vasa vasorum (VV)\n(adventitia) constitute granulation tissue repair. With granulation tissue\nhyperplasia, lots of collagen fibers (normal or denatured), foam cells and new\ncapillaries formed. Thus, the following theory was postulated: Risk factors\ninduce smooth muscle cells (SMCs) injury/loss, and fibrosis or structure\ndestruction could be developed in the media, which lead to media dysfunction.\nMedia dysfunction prompts disturbed mechanical properties of blood vessels,\nresulting in bigger pressure buildup in the intima and adventitia. Granulation\ntissues in the intima/adventitia develop to repair the injured media.\nAtherosclerosis, stiffening or aneurysm develops depending on media dysfunction\nseverity and granulated tissue repair mode/degree. Nearly all characteristics\nof clinical atherosclerosis could be ideally interpreted with the theory. We\nbelieve that media dysfunction is a key initiator in the pathogenesis of\natherosclerosis. It is expected that media dysfunction theory of\natherosclerosis, should offer better understanding of the etiology for\natherosclerosis.\n",

        "summary": "  Identifying the mechanism of intercellular feedback regulation is critical\nfor the basic understanding of tissue growth control in organisms. In this\npaper, we analyze a tissue growth model consisting of a single lineage of two\ncell types regulated by negative feedback signalling molecules that undergo\nspatial diffusion. By deriving the fixed points for the uniform steady states\nand carrying out linear stability analysis, phase diagrams are obtained\nanalytically for arbitrary parameters of the model. Two different generic\ngrowth modes are found: blow-up growth and final-state controlled growth which\nare governed by the non-trivial fixed point and the trivial fixed point\nrespectively, and can be sensitively switched by varying the negative feedback\nregulation on the proliferation of the stem cells. Analytic expressions for the\ncharacteristic time scales for these two growth modes are also derived.\nRemarkably, the trivial and non-trivial uniform steady states can coexist and a\nsharp transition occurs in the bistable regime as the relevant parameters are\nvaried. Furthermore, the bi-stable growth properties allows for the external\ncontrol to switch between these two growth modes. In addition, the condition\nfor an early accelerated growth followed by a retarded growth can be derived.\nThese analytical results are further verified by numerical simulations and\nprovide insights on the growth behavior of the tissue. Our results are also\ndiscussed in the light of possible realistic biological experiments and tissue\ngrowth control strategy. Furthermore, by external feedback control of the\nconcentration of regulatory molecules, it is possible to achieve a desired\ngrowth mode, as demonstrated with an analysis of boosted growth, catch-up\ngrowth and the design for the target of a linear growth dynamic.\n",

The\npresent preliminary study examines the behaviour of iodine present in the\nmedullary cavity of a bovine long bone exposed to mechanical load. A section of\nthe bone is x-ray scanned with the static load present, with and without the\niodine. The resulting distribution in a selected 2D plane is numerically\nevaluated using a discrete Radon's inverse transform. The result suggests that\niodine is a useful constituent with a good attenuation effect on the x-ray beam\nand clearly reveals the temporal distribution of its transport through the\nbone.

Such comparators are a\nnecessary precursor for further formal validation studies of FSI simulations\ninvolving heart valves. In this work, we performed physical experiments of flow\nthrough a pulmonary valve in an in vitro pulse duplicator, and measured the\ncorresponding velocity field using 4D flow MRI (4-dimensional flow magnetic\nresonance imaging). We constructed a computer model of this pulmonary artery\nsetup, including modeling valve geometry and material properties via a\ntechnique called design-based elasticity, and simulated flow through it with\nthe IB method.

Previous models, based on the kinematic growth theory, reproduced\nconsequences of G&R in bulk myocardial tissue by prescribing the direction and\nextent of growth but neglected underlying cellular mechanisms. In our model,\nthe direction and extent of G&R emerge naturally from intra- and extra cellular\nturnover processes in myocardial tissue constituents and their preferred\nhomeostatic stretch state. We additionally propose a method to obtain a\nmechanobiologically equilibrated reference configuration. We test our model on\nan idealized 3D left ventricular geometry and demonstrate that our model aims\nto maintain tensional homeostasis in hypertension conditions. In a stability\nmap, we identify regions of stable and unstable G&R from an identical parameter\nset with varying systolic pressures and growth factors.

This paper presents the first label-free,\nquantitative, and automated histological recognition of ovarian tissue subtypes\nusing a new MIRSI technique.

A suitable therapeutic avenue\nin these cases may involve the use of a differentiating agent (DA) to force the\ndifferentiation of the CSCs and of conventional therapies to eliminate the\nremaining differentiated cancer cells (DCCs). To describe the effects of a DA\nthat reprograms CSCs into DCCs, we adapt a differential equation model\ndeveloped to investigate tumorspheres, which are assumed to consist of jointly\nevolving CSC and DCC populations. We analyze the mathematical properties of the\nmodel, finding the equilibria and their stability. We also present numerical\nsolutions and phase diagrams to describe the system evolution and the therapy\neffects, denoting the DA strength by a parameter \\(a_{dif}\\).To obtain\nrealistic predictions, we choose the other model parameters to be those\ndetermined previously from fits to various experimental datasets. These\ndatasets characterize the progression of the tumor under various culture\nconditions. Typically, for small values of \\(a_{dif}\\) the tumor evolves\ntowards a final state that contains a CSC fraction, but a strong therapy leads\nto the suppression of this phenotype. Nonetheless, different external\nconditions lead to very diverse behaviors. For some environmental conditions,\nthe model predicts a threshold not only in the therapy strength, but also in\nits starting time, an early beginning being potentially crucial.

The\nplaque boundary is assumed to move at the same speed as the inflammatory\ntissues close to the periphery. This study discusses oxLDL-induced toxic\nenvironment towards macrophages and foam cells such that they start to die\nbeyond a threshold limit of oxLDL concentration owing to excessive consumption.\nOur findings reveal that initially, the plaque evolves rapidly, and the growth\nrate subsequently reduces because of oxLDL-induced toxicity. In addition, it is\nobserved that the saturation of inflammatory cell volume fraction becomes\nindependent of oxLDL concentration beyond the threshold limit, referred to as\nthe oxLDL toxicity limit. Our study manifests that increased oxLDL flux\npromotes flattened plaque growth through oxLDL-induced toxicity, while elevated\ncytokines flux disrupts the corresponding flattened behaviour. Detailed\nanalysis of the model presented in this article unfolds critical insights into\nthe various biochemical and cellular mechanisms behind early plaque\ndevelopment.\n",

As experimental efforts are underway to solve this puzzle via\nquantification of gene expression and sub-cellular, cellular and tissue\nstructure, computational efforts remain far behind. To potentially help\naccelerate the computational efforts, we review two recent publications, the\nfirst on a cellular-based model for tissues and the second on a cell nucleus\nmodel consisting of chromatin and a lamina shell. We then give a perspective on\nhow the two models can be combined to test multiscale hypotheses linking the\nchromatin scale and the tissue scale. To be concrete, we turn to an in vitro\nsystem for the brain known as a brain organoid. We provide a multiscale\nhypothesis to distinguish structural differences between brain organoids built\nfrom induced-pluripotent human stem cells and from induced-pluripotent gorilla\nand chimpanzee stem cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate\ntransition from neuroepithelial cells to radial glial cells includes a new\nintermediate state that is delayed in human-derived brain organoids as compared\nto their genetically-close relatives, which significantly narrows and lengthens\nthe cells on the apical side [1]. Additional experiments revealed that the\nprotein ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this new intermediate state\nwith ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking at the onset of the emergence [1]. We postulate\nthat the enhancement of ZEB2 expression driving this intermediate state is\npotentially due to chromatin reorganization. More precisely, there exists\ncritical strain triggering the reorganization that is higher for human-derived\nstem cells, thereby resulting in a delay. Such a hypothesis can readily be\ntested experimentally within individual cells and within brain organoids as\nwell as computationally to work towards solving the gene-to-tissue organization\npuzzle.\n",

For confluent biological tissues, both vertex and\nVoronoi models, which differ only in their representation of the degrees of\nfreedom, have effectively been used to predict behavior, including fluid-solid\ntransitions and cell tissue compartmentalization, which are important for\nbiological function. However, recent work in 2D has hinted that there may be\ndifferences between the two models in systems with heterotypic interfaces\nbetween two tissue types, and there is a burgeoning interest in 3D tissue\nmodels. Therefore, we compare the geometric structure and dynamic sorting\nbehavior in mixtures of two cell types in both 3D vertex and Voronoi models. We\nfind that while the cell shape indices exhibit similar trends in both models,\nthe registration between cell centers and cell orientation at the boundary are\nsignificantly different between the two models. We demonstrate that these\nmacroscopic differences are caused by changes to the cusp-like restoring forces\nintroduced by the different representations of the degrees of freedom at the\nboundary, and that the Voronoi model is more strongly constrained by forces\nthat are an artifact of the way the degrees of freedom are represented. This\nsuggests that vertex models may be more appropriate for 3D simulations of\ntissues with heterotypic contacts.\n",

        "summary": "  Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces muscle wasting and a\nreduction in the maximum voluntary force (MVF). Little is known about the\nneuromuscular fatigability in CKD patients, defined as the reduction of muscle\nforce capacities during exercise. Neuromuscular fatigability is a crucial\nphysical parameter of the daily living. The quantification of explosive force\nhas been shown to be a sensitive means to assess neuromuscular fatigability.\nThus, our study used explosive force estimates to assess neuromuscular\nfatigability in elderly CKD patients. Methods Inclusion criteria for CKD\npatients were age $\\ge$ 60 years old and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 45\nmL/ min/1.73 m 2 not on dialysis, and those for controls were GFR > 60\nmL/min/1.73 m 2 , age and diabetes matched. The fatigability protocol focused\non a handgrip task coupled with surface electromyography (sEMG). Scalars were\nextracted from the rate of force development (RFD): absolute and normalized\ntime periods (50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 ms, RFD 50 , RFD 75 , RFD 100 , RFD 150\nand RFD 200 , respectively), peak RFD (RFD peak in absolute; NRFD peak\nnormalized), timeto-peak RFD (t-RFD peak) and the relative force at RFD peak\n(MVF-RFD peak). A statistical parametric mapping approach was performed on the\nforce, impulse and RFD-time curves. The integrated sEMG with time at 0-30,\n0-50, 0-100 and 0-200 ms time intervals relative to onset of sEMG activity was\nextracted and groups were compared separately for each sex. Results The cohort\nof 159 individuals had a median age of 69 (9 IQR) years and body mass index was\n27.6 (6.2 IQR) kg/ m 2. Propensity-score-matched groups balanced CKD patients\nand controls by gender with 66 males and 34 females. In scalar analysis, CKD\npatients manifested a higher decrement than controls in the early phase of\ncontraction, regarding the NRFD peak (P = 0.009; $\\eta$ 2 p = 0.034) and RFD 75\nand RFD 100 (for both P < 0.001; $\\eta$ 2 p = 0.068 and 0.064). The\nonedimensional analysis confirmed that CKD males manifest higher and delayed\nneuromuscular fatigability, especially before 100 ms from onset of contraction.\nsEMG was lower in CKD patients than controls in the 0-100 ms (at rest: P =\n0.049, Cohen's d = 0.458) and 0-200 ms (at rest: P = 0.016, Cohen's d = 0.496;\nduring exercise: P = 0.006, Cohen's d = 0.421) time windows. Controls showed\ngreater decrease of sEMG than CKD patients in the 0-30 ms (P = 0.020, Cohen's d\n= 0.533) and 0-50 ms (P = 0.010, Cohen's d = 0.640) time windows. As opposite\nto females, males showed almost the same differences between groups.\nConclusions Our study is the first to show that CKD patients have higher\nfatigability than controls, which may be associated with an impaired motor-unit\nrecruitment, highlighting a neural drive disturbance with CKD. Further studies\nare needed to confirm these findings.\n",

Approaches are needed that (1) make predictions of optimal\narteriovenous networks in order to understand the natural vasculatures that\noriginate from evolution (2) can design vasculature for 3D printing of cultured\ntissues, meats, organoids and organs. I present a method for determining the\nglobally optimal structure of interlocking arterial and venous (arteriovenous)\nnetworks. The core physics is comprised of the minimization of total power\nassociated with the whole vascular network, with penalties to stop arterial and\nvenous segments from intersecting. Specifically, the power needed for\nPoiseuille flow through vessels and the metabolic power cost for blood\nmaintenance are optimized. Simultaneous determination of both arterial and\nvenous vasculatures is essential to avoid intersections between vessels that\nwould bypass the capillary network. As proof-of-concept, I examine the optimal\nvascular structure for supplying square- and disk-like tissue shapes that would\nbe suitable for bioprinting in multi-well plates. Features in the trees are\ndriven by the bifurcation exponent and metabolic constant which affect whether\narteries and veins follow the same or different routes through the tissue. They\nalso affect the level of tortuosity in the vessels. The method could be used to\nunderstand the distribution of blood vessels within organs, to form the core of\nsimulations, and combined with 3D printing to generate vasculatures for\narbitrary volumes of cultured tissue and cultured meat.\n",

Simulation tools and the\ndata used for model calibration are also inherently uncertain, requiring a full\nanalysis of the sensitivity and uncertainty attributed to model inputs and\noutputs. Thus, this study quantifies model sensitivity and output uncertainty\nin a multiscale, pulse-wave propagation model of pulmonary hemodynamics. Our\npulmonary circuit model consists of fifteen proximal arteries and twelve\nproximal veins, connected by a two-sided, structured tree model of the distal\nvasculature. We use polynomial chaos expansions to expedite the sensitivity and\nuncertainty quantification analyses and provide results for both the proximal\nand distal vasculature. Our analyses provide uncertainty in blood pressure,\nflow, and wave propagation phenomenon, as well as wall shear stress and cyclic\nstretch, both of which are important stimuli for endothelial cell\nmechanotransduction.

However, pressure often proves difficult to measure through\nin-vivo tests. Simulations on the other hand, offer a tool to model muscle\ncontractions and analyze the relationship between muscle force generation and\ndeformations as well as pressure outputs, enabling us to gain insight into\ncorrelations among experimentally measurable quantities such as principal and\nvolumetric strains, and the force output. In this work, a correlation study is\nperformed using Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients on the force\noutput of the skeletal muscle, the principal and volumetric strains experienced\nby the muscle and the pressure developed within the muscle belly as the muscle\ntissue undergoes isometric contractions due to varying activation profiles. The\nstudy reveals strong correlations between force output and the strains at all\nlocations of the belly, irrespective of the type of activation profile used.\nThis observation enables estimation on the contribution of various muscle\ngroups to the total force by the experimentally measurable principal and\nvolumetric strains in the muscle belly. It is also observed that pressure does\nnot correlate well with force output due to stress relaxation near the boundary\nof muscle belly.\n",

There are no reliable clinical protocols to\npredict growth, dissection, and rupture because the fundamental physics driving\naneurysm progression is unknown. Here, via in-vitro experiments, we show that a\nblood-wall, fluttering instability manifests in synthetic arteries under\npulsatile forcing. We establish a phase space to prove that the transition from\nstable flow to unstable aortic flutter is accurately predicted by a flutter\ninstability parameter derived from first principles. Time resolved strain maps\nof the evolving system reveal the dynamical characteristics of aortic flutter\nthat drive aneurysm progression. We show that low level instability can trigger\npermanent aortic growth, even in the absence of material remodeling.\nSufficiently large flutter beyond a secondary threshold localizes strain in the\nwalls to the length scale clinically observed in aortic dissection. Lastly,\nsignificant physical flutter beyond a tertiary threshold can ultimately induce\naneurysm rupture via failure modes reported from necropsy. Resolving the\nfundamental physics of aneurysm progression directly leads to clinical\nprotocols that forecast growth as well as intercept dissection and rupture by\npinpointing their physical origin.\n",

A\nkey difficulty is the weak knowledge of the fluid velocity that has to be\nreconstructed.

The\nparameterized model quantifies the strong influence of fluid velocity on\nadhesion and confirms the expected role of several proteins in the deceleration\nof CTCs.

Our\nobjective is to explore the influence of non-uniform oxygen supply in the\ndevelopment of necrotic core and, also to examine the effects of necrotic core\non tumor growth. Methods: The research is processed through a mathematical\napproach based on the multiphase mathematical model. To simulate the model, a\nfinite difference numerical method based on the Semi-Implicit Method for\nPressure-Linked Equations (SIMPLE) algorithm is adopted. Results: The necrotic\ncore starts to form at the boundary of the tumor with lower oxygen\nconcentration from the initial time. Investigations reveal that the position of\nthe necrotic core varies depending on the oxygen supply through the tumor\nboundary. The results predict asymmetrical tumor growth under unequal oxygen\nsupply at tumor boundaries. Also, it is hinted that a tumor with a larger size\nof necrotic core grows slowly as compared to a tumor containing a smaller size\nof necrotic core. Conclusions: The formulated model has the potential to cast\nthe situation of the tumor growth in an in-vivo and in-vitro situations. This\nstudy provides an idea about the location and shape of the necrotic core and\nthe impact of the necrotic core on tumor growth.

Until recently, this goal was thought to be out of reach\nfor realistic continuum-mechanical simulations of musculoskeletal systems, due\nto prohibitive computational cost. Within this work we use a sparse grid\nsurrogate to capture the surface deformation of the m.~biceps brachii in order\nto train a deep learning model, used for real-time visualisation of the same\nmuscle. Both these surrogate models take 5 muscle activation levels as input\nand output Cartesian coordinate vectors for each mesh node on the muscle's\nsurface. Thus, the neural network architecture features a significantly lower\ninput than output dimension. 5 muscle activation levels were sufficient to\nachieve an average error of 0.97 +/- 0.16 mm, or 0.57 +/- 0.10 % for the 2809\nmesh node positions of the biceps. The model achieved evaluation times of 9.88\nms per predicted deformation state on CPU only and 3.48 ms with GPU-support,\nleading to theoretical frame rates of 101 fps and 287 fps respectively. Deep\nlearning surrogates thus provide a way to make continuum-mechanical simulations\naccessible for visual real-time applications.\n",

This paper focuses on the question of model\ncalibration for fluid-structure interaction models of pediatric AAOCA patients.\nImaging and cardiac catheterization data provide partial information for model\nconstruction and calibration. However, parameters for downstream boundary\nconditions needed for these models are difficult to estimate. Further,\nimportant model predictions, like fractional flow reserve (FFR), are sensitive\nto these parameters.

Tumor was defined by drawing a volume\nof interest loosely surrounding the lesion and considering all inside voxels\nwith standardized uptake value (SUV) >40% of the maximum. After 20 minutes\ndynamic imaging centered on the heart, eight whole body scans were repeated.\nSix parametric maps were progressively generated by computing six regression\nlines that considered all eight frames, the last seven ones, and so on, up to\nthe last three. Results: Progressively delaying the starting point of\nregression line computation identified a progressive increase in the prevalence\nof voxels with a negative slope. Conclusions: The voxel-wise parametric maps\nprovided by compartmental analysis permits to identify a measurable volume\ncharacterized by radioactivity washout. The spatial localization of this\npattern is compatible with the recognized preferential site of inflammatory\ninfiltrates populating the tumor stroma and might improve the power of FDG\nimaging in monitoring the effectiveness of treatments aimed to empower the host\nimmune response against the cancer.\n",

Src activation leads\nto a 2-fold decrease in the ratio of polar angle to friction, which could\nresult from increased adhesiveness at the cell-substrate interface.

        "summary": "  Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease, leads to\narterial constriction caused by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, and\nvarious substances within artery walls. Such plaque can rupture, resulting in a\nblood clot that obstructs major arteries and may initiate myocardial\ninfarction, ischemic stroke, etc. Atherosclerotic plaque formation begins with\nthe accumulation of foam cells and macrophages within the intima layer of the\narterial wall. At the latter stage, the smooth muscle cells migrated from\ndeeper artery wall layers, contributing to the fibrous cap formation and plaque\nstabilizing. A developed plaque gradually enters the lumen and narrows down the\nlumen to impede blood flow. We introduce a two-phase and macroscopic model to\ninvestigate the progression of plaque growth in its advanced stage and analyze\nthe minimum gap (Lumen Clearance) within an atherosclerotic artery so that\nblood cells can pass through. Cardiac troponin, a high specificity and\nsensitivity biomarker, facilitates early detection of elevated myocardial\ninfarction, Ischemic stroke, etc. risks. This study aims to establish a\nrelationship between the troponin concentration in atherosclerotic arteries and\ntheir internal clearance, which could significantly improve our understanding\nof disease progression. Our observations show that the plaque undergoes rapid\nevolution in its initial stages, gradually slowing down over time to reach a\nsteady state. At the same time, the lumen clearance exhibits an opposite\nbehavior, decreasing slowly over time. Our study finds a positive correlation\nbetween plaque depth and troponin concentration in the blood and a negative\nrelationship between troponin concentrations and lumen clearance in\natherosclerotic arteries.\n",

Prognostic algorithms\nbased on deep learning have shown promise in detecting the onset of sepsis\nhours before the actual event but use a large number of bio-markers, including\nvital signs and laboratory tests. The latter makes the deployment of such\nsystems outside hospitals or in resource-limited environments extremely\nchallenging. This paper introduces SepAl, an energy-efficient and lightweight\nneural network, using only data from low-power wearable sensors, such as\nphotoplethysmography (PPG), inertial measurement units (IMU), and body\ntemperature sensors, designed to deliver alerts in real-time. SepAl leverages\nonly six digitally acquirable vital signs and tiny machine learning algorithms,\nenabling on-device real-time sepsis prediction.\n  SepAl uses a lightweight temporal convolution neural network capable of\nproviding sepsis alerts with a median predicted time to sepsis of 9.8 hours.\nThe model has been fully quantized, being able to be deployed on any low-power\nprocessors, and evaluated on an ARM Cortex-M33 core. Experimental evaluations\nshow an inference efficiency of 0.11MAC/Cycle and a latency of 143ms, with an\nenergy per inference of 2.68mJ.

These methods utilize different energy sources to\ndeliver heat to the target region, including light, microwaves or\nradiofrequency electromagnetic fields. We have developed a new, magnetically\nresponsive nanocarrier, consisting of liposomes loaded with magnetic\nnanoparticles and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), commonly known as\nCisplatin. The resulting magnetoliposome (ML) is rapidly internalized by lung\nand pancreas tumor cell lines, stored in intracellular vesicles, and capable of\ninducing hyperthermia under magnetic fields. The ML has no significant toxicity\nboth in vitro and in vivo and, most importantly, enhances cell death by\napoptosis after magnetic hyperthermia. Remarkably, mice bearing induced lung\ntumors, treated with CDDP-loaded nanocarriers and subjected to an applied\nelectromagnetic field, showed an improved survival rate over those treated with\neither soluble CDDP or hyperthermia alone. Therefore, our approach of magnetic\nhyperthermia plus CDDP-ML significantly enhances in vitro cell death and in\nvivo survival of treated animals.\n",

As osmotically driven water uptake is\noften distal from the tips, and aqueous fluids are incompressible, we propose\nthat growth induces mass flows across the mycelium, whether or not there are\nintrahyphal concentration gradients. We imaged the temporal evolution of\nnetworks formed by Phanerochaete velutina, and at each stage calculated the\nunique set of currents that account for the observed changes in cord volume,\nwhile minimising the work required to overcome viscous drag. Predicted speeds\nwere in reasonable agreement with experimental data, and the pressure gradients\nneeded to produce these flows are small. Furthermore, cords that were predicted\nto carry fast-moving or large currents were significantly more likely to\nincrease in size than cords with slow-moving or small currents. The\nincompressibility of the fluids within fungi means there is a rapid global\nresponse to local fluid movements. Hence velocity of fluid flow is a local\nsignal that conveys quasi-global information about the role of a cord within\nthe mycelium. We suggest that fluid incompressibility and the coupling of\ngrowth and mass flow are critical physical features that enable the development\nof efficient, adaptive, biological transport networks.\n",

We explore this question in the segmentation clock, a population of\ncoupled cellular oscillators in the vertebrate embryo that sets the rhythm of\nsomitogenesis, the morphological segmentation of the body axis. The oscillating\ncells of the zebrafish segmentation clock are thought to possess noisy\nautonomous periods, which are synchronized by intercellular coupling through\nthe Delta-Notch pathway. Here we ask whether Delta-Notch coupling additionally\ninfluences the collective period of the segmentation clock. Using\nmultiple-embryo time-lapse microscopy, we show that disruption of Delta-Notch\nintercellular coupling increases the period of zebrafish somitogenesis.\nEmbryonic segment length and the spatial wavelength of oscillating gene\nexpression also increase correspondingly, indicating an increase in the\nsegmentation clock's period. Using a theory based on phase oscillators in which\nthe collective period self-organizes because of time delays in coupling, we\nestimate the cell-autonomous period, the coupling strength, and the coupling\ndelay from our data. Further supporting the role of coupling delays in the\nclock, we predict and experimentally confirm an instability resulting from\ndecreased coupling delay time. Synchronization of cells by Delta-Notch coupling\nregulates the collective period of the segmentation clock. Our identification\nof the first segmentation clock period mutants is a critical step toward a\nmolecular understanding of temporal control in this system.

We consider\nthe implications of advection, diffusion and delivery for simple models of\nglucose delivery through a vascular network, and conclude that in certain\ncircumstances, increasing the volume of blood and the number of glucose\ntransporters can actually decrease the total rate of glucose delivery. We also\nconsider the case of empirically determined fungal networks, and analyze the\ndistribution of resource that emerges as such networks grow over time.

In three empirically determined fungal networks\nwe found that the minimum currents consistent with the observed growth would\neffectively transport resource throughout the network over the time-scale of\ngrowth.

Mathematical modelling of\nsignalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of\nexperimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper\nunderstanding of complex bone diseases. In this paper, we further develop a\nmathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to\ninclude the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This\ninclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to\nplay an important role in anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased\nrate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of\nproliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone\nmass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new\nmodel to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt\nsignalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells\nby transforming growth factor \\beta. Finally, we illustrate the power of the\nnew model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to\nbone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to\nrelease some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone\nremodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal\nsignalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to\neither bone gain or bone loss. We demonstrate that the new computational model\ndeveloped here is capable of capturing some key observations made on the\nevolution of the bone mass due to metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone\nmicroenvironment\n",

Although\nexperiments revealed qualitatively that the coiling movement is governed by the\nhydraulic mechanism and the uncoiling movement is due to the musculature and\nthe elasticity, it needs a quantitative investigation to reveal how insects\nachieve these behaviors accurately. Here a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D)\ncurvature elastica model is proposed to reveal the mechanism of these\nbehaviors. We find that the functions of internal stipes muscle and basal\ngaleal muscle which locate at the bottom of proboscis are to adjust the initial\nstates in the coiling and uncoiling processes, respectively. The function of\ninternal galeal muscle which exists along proboscis is to adjust the line\ntension. The knee bend shape is due to the local maximal spontaneous curvature\nand is an advantage for nectar-feeding butterfly. When there is no knee bend,\nthe proboscis of fruit-piercing butterfly is easy to achieve the piercing\nmovement which induced by the increase of internal hydraulic pressure. All of\nthe results are in good agreement with experiential observation.

Karma, and J. G. Restrepo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 108103\n(2012)] and ionic model simulations. We find that, close to the alternans\nbifurcation, SDA is manifested as a smooth wavy modulation of the amplitudes of\nboth repolarization and calcium transient (CaT) alternans, similarly to the\nwell-studied case of voltage-driven alternans. In contrast, further away from\nthe bifurcation, the amplitude of CaT alternans jumps discontinuously at the\nnodes separating out-of-phase regions, while the amplitude of repolarization\nalternans remains smooth. We show that node motion of discontinuous SDA\npatterns is strongly hysteretic even in homogeneous tissue due to the novel\nphenomenon of \"unidirectional pinning\": node movement can only be induced\ntowards, but not away from, the pacing site in response to a change of pacing\nrate or physiological parameter. In addition, we show that the wavelength of\ndiscontinuous SDA patterns scales linearly with the conduction velocity\nrestitution length scale, in contrast to the wavelength of smooth patterns that\nscales sub-linearly with this length scale. Those results are also shown to be\nrobust against cell-to-cell fluctuations owing to the property that\nunidirectional node motion collapses multiple jumps accumulating in nodal\nregions into a single jump. Amplitude equation predictions are in good overall\nagreement with ionic model simulations. Finally, we briefly discuss\nphysiological implications of our findings. In particular, we suggest that due\nto the tendency of conduction blocks to form near nodes, the presence of\nunidirectional pinning makes calcium-driven alternans potentially more\narrhythmogenic than voltage-driven alternans.\n",

The progression of AF with\nage, from short self-terminating episodes to persistence, varies between\nindividuals and is poorly understood. An inability to understand and predict\nvariation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.\nLikewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of\nheart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal\nclinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront\npropagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show\nhow variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences\nbetween individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive\ntransversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap\njunctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF\nepisode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between\nindividuals. This is consistent with clinical observations. The uncoupling of\nmuscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.\nThese critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger\nAF. It is the number of local critical patterns of uncoupling as opposed to\nglobal uncoupling that determines AF progression. This insight may eventually\nlead to patient specific therapy when it becomes possible to observe the\ncellular structure of a patient's heart.\n",

Consequently there has been significant interest\nin understanding how cardiac activity is influenced by the circadian clock,\ni.e., temporal oscillations in physiological activity with a period close to 24\nhours and synchronized with the day-night cycle. Although studies have\nidentified the genetic basis of circadian rhythms at the intracellular level,\nthe mechanisms by which they influence cardiac pathologies are not yet fully\nunderstood. Evidence has suggested that diurnal variations in the conductance\nproperties of ion channel proteins that govern the excitation dynamics of\ncardiac cells may provide the crucial link. In this paper, we investigate the\nrelationship between the circadian rhythm as manifested in modulations of ion\nchannel properties and the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias by using a\nmathematical model that describes electrical activity in ventricular tissue. We\nshow that changes in the channel conductance that lead to extreme values for\nthe duration of action potentials in cardiac cells can result either in\nabnormally high-frequency reentrant activity or spontaneous conduction block of\nexcitation waves. Both phenomena increase the likelihood of wavebreaks that are\nknown to initiate potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.

Moreover, the inference of the distribution of the\nbending stiffness from experimental images indicates a common spatial profile\namong insects tested. We further studied the effect of the intrinsic tension of\nthe wing blade on the margin shape and on the inferred bending stiffness.\nFinally, we implemented the bending stiffness of the wing margin in the cell\nvertex model of the wing blade, and confirmed that the hybrid model retains the\nessential feature of the margin model. We propose that in addition to\nmorphogenetic processes in the wing blade, the spatial profile of the bending\nstiffness in the wing margin can play a pivotal role in shaping insect wings.\n",

The increasing resistance of S.aureus to various\nantibiotics has drawn it to a prime focus for research on designing an\nappropriate drug delivery system. Emergence of Methicillin Resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 1961, necessitated the use of vancomycin \"the\ndrug of last resort\" to treat these infections. Unfortunately, S.aureus has\nalready started gaining resistances to vancomycin. Liposome encapsulation of\ndrugs have been earlier shown to provide an efficient method of microbial\ninhibition in many cases. We have studied the effect of liposome encapsulated\nvancomycin on MRSA and evaluated the antibacterial activity of the\nliposome-entrapped drug in comparison to that of the free drug based on the\nminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug. The MIC for liposomal\nvancomycin was found to be about half of that of free vancomycin. The growth\nresponse of MRSA showed that the liposomal vancomycin induced the culture to go\ninto bacteriostatic state and phagocytic killing was enhanced. Administration\nof the antibiotic encapsulated in liposome thus was shown to greatly improve\nthe drug delivery as well as the drug resistance caused by MRSA.\n",

For concreteness, we focus on the detection of cancer cells\nlocated in a particular region of a blood vessel. These cancer cells produce\nand emit special molecules, so-called biomarkers, which are symptomatic for the\npresence of anomaly, into the cardiovascular system. Detection of cancer\nbiomarkers with conventional blood tests is difficult in the early stages of a\ncancer due to the very low concentration of the biomarkers in the samples\ntaken. However, close to the cancer cells, the concentration of the cancer\nbiomarkers is high. Hence, detection is possible if a sensor with the ability\nto detect these biomarkers is placed in the vicinity of the cancer cells.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study the use of MNSs that are injected at a\nsuitable injection site and can move through the blood vessels of the\ncardiovascular system, which potentially contain cancer cells. These MNSs can\nbe activated by the biomarkers close to the cancer cells, where the biomarker\nconcentration is sufficiently high. Eventually, the MNSs are collected by a\nfusion center (FC) where their activation levels are read and exploited to\ndeclare the presence of anomaly. We analytically derive the biomarker\nconcentration as well as the probability mass function of the MNSs' activation\nlevels and validate the obtained results via particle-based simulations. Then,\nwe derive the optimal decision rule for the FC regarding the presence of\nanomaly assuming that the entire network is known at the FC. Finally, for the\nFC, we propose a simple sum detector that does not require knowledge of the\nnetwork topology. Our simulations reveal that while the optimal detector\nachieves a higher performance than the sum detector, both proposed detectors\nsignificantly outperform a benchmark scheme that used fixed nanosensors at the\nFC.\n",

The theory of volume growth, starting from a stress-free\ninitial state, is widely used to explain the creation and evolution of\ngrowth-induced residual stress and the resulting changes in shape, and to model\nhow growing bio-tissues such as arteries and solid tumors develop a strategy of\npattern creation according to geometrical and material parameters. This\nmodelling provides promising avenues for designing and directing some\nappropriate morphology of a given tissue or organ and achieve some targeted\nbiomedical function. In this paper, we rely on a modified, augmented theory to\nreveal how we can obtain growth-induced residual stress and pattern evolution\nof a layered artery by starting from an existing, non-zero initial residual\nstress state. We use experimentally determined residual stress distributions of\naged bi-layered human aortas and quantify their influence by a magnitude\nfactor. Our results show that initial residual stress has a more significant\nimpact on residual stress accumulation and the subsequent evolution of patterns\nthan geometry and material parameters. Additionally, we provide an essential\nexplanation for growth-induced patterns driven by differential growth coupled\nto an initial residual stress. Finally, we show that initial residual stress is\na readily available way to control growth-induced pattern creation for tissues\nand thus may provide a promising inspiration for biomedical engineering.\n",

This includes epithelial tissues, which often\nnarrow and elongate in convergent extension movements due to anisotropies in\nexternal forces or in internal cell-generated forces. However, the mechanisms\nthat allow or prevent tissue reorganization, especially in the presence of\nstrongly anisotropic forces, remain unclear. We study this question in the\nconverging and extending Drosophila germband epithelium, which displays planar\npolarized myosin II and experiences anisotropic forces from neighboring\ntissues, and we show that in contrast to isotropic tissues, cell shape alone is\nnot sufficient to predict the onset of rapid cell rearrangement. From\ntheoretical considerations and vertex model simulations, we predict that in\nanisotropic tissues two experimentally accessible metrics of cell patterns, the\ncell shape index and a cell alignment index, are required to determine whether\nan anisotropic tissue is in a solid-like or fluid-like state. We show that\nchanges in cell shape and alignment over time in the Drosophila germband\npredict the onset of rapid cell rearrangement in both wild-type and snail twist\nmutant embryos, where our theoretical prediction is further improved when we\nalso account for cell packing disorder.

We perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of\nsolutions w.r.t. various scenarios of tissue dynamics and the dominance of each\nof the tactic terms, also suggesting how the model can be used to perform a\nnumerical necrosis-based tumor grading or support radiotherapy planning by dose\npainting. We also provide a discussion about alternative ways of including cell\nlevel environmental influences in such multiscale modeling approach, ultimately\nleading in the macroscopic limit to (multiple) taxis.\n",

        "summary": "  Pulmonary drug delivery systems rely on inhalation of drug-laden aerosols\nproduced from aerosol generators such as inhalers, nebulizers etc. On\ndeposition, the drug molecules diffuse in the mucus layer and are also\nsubjected to mucociliary advection which transports the drugs away from the\ninitial deposition site. The availability of the drug at a particular region of\nthe lung is, thus, determined by a balance between these two phenomena. A\nmathematical analysis of drug deposition and retention in the lungs is\ndeveloped through a coupled mathematical model of aerosol transport in air as\nwell as drug molecule transport in the mucus layer. The mathematical model is\nsolved computationally to identify suitable conditions for the transport of\ndrug-laden aerosols to the deep lungs. This study identifies the conditions\nconducive for delivering drugs to the deep lungs which is crucial for achieving\nsystemic drug delivery. The effect of different parameters on drug retention is\nalso characterized for various regions of the lungs, which is important in\ndetermining the availability of the inhaled drugs at a target location. Our\nanalysis confirms that drug delivery efficacy remains highest for aerosols in\nthe size range of 1-5 $\\mu$m. Moreover, it is observed that amount of drugs\ndeposited in the deep lung increases by a factor of 2 when the breathing time\nperiod is doubled, with respect to normal breathing, suggesting breath control\nas a means to increase the efficacy of drug delivery to the deep lung. A higher\nefficacy also reduces the drug load required to be inhaled to produce the same\nhealth effects and hence, can help in minimizing the side effects of a drug.\n",

This article describes both direct numerical simulations and an\nasymptotic theory of propagation and block of electrical excitation in a model\nof atrial tissue with myocyte-fibroblast coupling. In particular, three\nidealised fibroblast distributions are introduced: uniform distribution,\nfibroblast barrier and myocyte strait, all believed to be constituent blocks of\nrealistic fibroblast distributions. Primary action potential biomarkers\nincluding conduction velocity, peak potential and triangulation index are\nestimated from direct simulations in all cases. Propagation block is found to\noccur at certain critical values of the parameters defining each idealised\nfibroblast distribution and these critical values are accurately determined. An\nasymptotic theory proposed earlier is extended and applied to the case of a\nuniform fibroblast distribution. Biomarker values are obtained from hybrid\nanalytical-numerical solutions of coupled fast-time and slow-time periodic\nboundary value problems and compare well to direct numerical simulations. The\nboundary of absolute refractoriness is determined solely by the fast-time\nproblem and is found to depend on the values of the myocyte potential and on\nthe slow inactivation variable of the sodium current ahead of the propagating\npulse. In turn, these quantities are estimated from the slow-time problem using\na regular perturbation expansion to find the steady state of the coupled\nmyocyte-fibroblast kinetics. The asymptotic theory gives a simple analytical\nexpression that captures with remarkable accuracy the block of propagation in\nthe presence of fibroblasts.\n",

As the heterogeneous\ndeposition of inhaled radon progeny results in high local doses at the peak of\nthe bronchial bifurcations, it was proposed earlier that hyperplasia occurs in\nthese deposition hot spots upon chronic radon exposure. The objective of the\npresent study is to quantify how the induction of basal cell hyperplasia\nmodulates the microdosimetric consequences of a given radon exposure. For this\npurpose, numerical epithelium models were generated with spherical cell nuclei\nof six different cell types based on histological data. Basal cell hyperplasia\nwas modelled by epithelium models with additional basal cells and increased\nepithelium thickness. Microdosimetry for alpha-particles was performed by an\nown-developed Monte-Carlo code. Results show that the average tissue dose, and\nthe average hit number and dose of basal cells decrease by the increase of the\nmeasure of hyperplasia. Hit and dose distribution reveal that the induction of\nhyperplasia may result in a basal cell pool which is shielded from alpha\nradiation. It highlights that the exposure history affects the microdosimetric\nconsequences of a present exposure, while the biological and health effects may\nalso depend on previous exposures. The induction of hyperplasia can be\nconsidered as a radioadaptive response at the tissue level. Such an adaptation\nof the tissue challenges the validity of the application of the dose dose rate\neffectiveness factor from a mechanistic point of view.

Methods: a compartmental model of\nglucose-insulin dynamics combined with a deconvolution technique for state\nestimation is employed for glucose prediction. In silico data corresponding\nfrom the 10 adult subjects of UVa-Padova simulator, and clinical data from 10\nadults with T1D were used.

Results: For a prediction horizon of 60 minutes, accounting\nfor meal absorption and physical exercise improved glucose forecasting\naccuracy. In particular, root mean square error (mg/dL) went from 26.68 to\n23.89, p<0.001 (in silico data); and from 37.02 to 35.96, p<0.001 (clinical\ndata - only meal information).

First, eleven features including\nbasic information of an individual, symptoms and results of routine physical\nexamination are selected, as well as one label is specified, indicating whether\nan individual suffers from different severity of coronary artery stenosis or\nnot. On the basis of it, a sample set is constructed. Second, each of these\nfour ML algorithms learns from the sample set to obtain the corresponding\noptimal classified results, respectively. The experimental results show that:\nRF performs better than other three algorithms, and the former algorithm\nclassifies whether an individual has CS with an accuracy of 95.7% (=90/94).\n",

Previous modeling\nstudies have shown that pelvis submarining could not be replicated using\nexisting human body models. The goal of this study is to perform model\nmodifications and investigate whether they could lead to model submarining. By\ndetaching the connections between the pelvis and surrounding flesh, submarining\nlike belt kinematics were observed. By remeshing the flesh parts of the model,\nsimilar belt kinematics was observed but the pelvic wings were fractured.\nFinally, large shear deformation on the flesh together with submarining like\nkinematics were observed in the model with its flesh modeled using the meshless\nSmooth Particle Galerkin Method SPG method. The results of this study showed\nthat SPG method has potential to simulate large deformations in soft tissue\nwhich may be necessary to improve the biofidelity of belt/pelvis interaction.\n",

        "summary": "  From the nano-scale to the macro-scale, biological tissue is spatially\nheterogeneous. Even when tissue behavior is well understood, the exact subject\nspecific spatial distribution of material properties is often unknown. And,\nwhen developing computational models of biological tissue, it is usually\nprohibitively computationally expensive to simulate every plausible spatial\ndistribution of material properties for each problem of interest. Therefore,\none of the major challenges in developing accurate computational models of\nbiological tissue is capturing the potential effects of this spatial\nheterogeneity. Recently, machine learning based metamodels have gained\npopularity as a computationally tractable way to overcome this problem because\nthey can make predictions based on a limited number of direct simulation runs.\nThese metamodels are promising, but they often still require a high number of\ndirect simulations to achieve an acceptable performance. Here we show that\ntransfer learning, a strategy where knowledge gained while solving one problem\nis transferred to solving a different but related problem, can help overcome\nthis limitation. Critically, transfer learning can be used to leverage both\nlow-fidelity simulation data and simulation data that is the outcome of solving\na different but related mechanical problem. In this paper, we extend Mechanical\nMNIST, our open source benchmark dataset of heterogeneous material undergoing\nlarge deformation, to include a selection of low-fidelity simulation results\nthat require 2-4 orders of magnitude less CPU time to run. Then, we show that\ntransferring the knowledge stored in metamodels trained on these low-fidelity\nsimulation results can vastly improve the performance of metamodels used to\npredict the results of high-fidelity simulations.\n",

Here we reported the\ndevelopment of a novel and robust nano-structured calcium phosphate coating\nwith unique functions on the track-etched porous mem-brane by using an\nammonia-induced mineralization (AiM) technique. The calcium phosphate coating\nuni-formly covers one side of the PET membrane enabling testing for\nosteoclastic resorption. The track-etched pores in the PET membrane allow\ncalcium phosphate mineral pins to grow inside, which, on one hand, enhances\ncoating integration with membrane substrate, and on the other hand provides\ndiffusion channels for delivering drugs from the lower chamber of a\ndouble-chamber cell culture system. The applications of the processed calcium\nphosphate coating was first demonstrated as a drug screening device by using\nalen-dronate, a widely used drug for osteoporosis. It was confirmed that the\ndelivery of alendronate significant-ly decreased both the number of\nmonocyte-differentiated osteoclasts and coating resorption. To demon-strate the\napplication in studying bone metastasis, we delivered PC3 prostate cancer\nconditioned medium and confirmed that both the differentiation of monocytes\ninto osteoclasts and the osteoclastic resorption of the calcium phosphate\ncoating were significantly enhanced.

However, a uniform nutrient distribution\nis critical, as it prevents tissue death in poorly supplied areas. How, then,\ndo vascular networks achieve equi-perfusion? Given the extensive number of\nvessels in animal vascular systems, the structure of smaller vessels cannot be\nfully genetically predetermined and thus relies on a self-organizing\ndevelopmental mechanism. We propose a simple, optimization-based adaptation\nrule to control vessel radii, aiming to equalize perfusion while minimizing\nflow resistance and material cost. This adaptation balances three competing\nfactors: perfusion efficiency, energy dissipation, and material expenditure,\nwhich together drive complex network morphologies. These morphologies range\nfrom hierarchical architectures optimized for minimal resistance and material\ncost to dense networks that achieve efficient perfusion. Notably, metabolic\ndemand is the primary factor modulating the transition between these\ncontrasting structures. By applying our adaptation rule to networks in the rat\nmesentery and comparing the resulting optimal perfusion architectures with the\nexperimental data, we can estimate the biologically relevant parameters, such\nas the oxygen absorption rate, for which the optimization and experimental\nnetworks align the most.

Large\nvariations in biophysical properties and flow conditions exist in this system\nnecessitating the use of different flow models for different geometries and\nflow regimes.

Second, we assign 1D linearized\nhyperbolic PDEs to model the smaller arteries with stiffer vessel walls. The\nthird model type consists of ODE systems (0D models).

        "summary": "  Multicellular organisms exhibit a high degree of structural organization with\nspecific cell types always occurring in characteristic locations. The\nconventional framework for describing the emergence of such consistent spatial\npatterns is provided by Wolpert's \"French flag\" paradigm. According to this\nview, intra-cellular genetic regulatory mechanisms use positional information\nprovided by morphogen concentration gradients to differentially express\ndistinct fates, resulting in a characteristic pattern of differentiated cells.\nHowever, recent experiments have shown that suppression of inter-cellular\ninteractions can alter these spatial patterns, suggesting that cell fates are\nnot exclusively determined by the regulation of gene expression by local\nmorphogen concentration. Using an explicit model where adjacent cells\ncommunicate by Notch signaling, we provide a mechanistic description of how\ncontact-mediated interactions allow information from the cellular environment\nto be incorporated into cell fate decisions. Viewing cellular differentiation\nin terms of trajectories along an epigenetic landscape (as first enunciated by\nWaddington), our results suggest that the contours of the landscape are moulded\ndifferently in a cell position-dependent manner, not only by the global signal\nprovided by the morphogen but also by the local environment via cell-cell\ninteractions. We show that our results are robust with respect to different\nchoices of coupling between the inter-cellular signaling apparatus and the\nintra-cellular gene regulatory dynamics. Indeed, we show that the broad\nfeatures can be observed even in abstract spin models. Our work reconciles\ninteraction-mediated self-organized pattern formation with boundary-organized\nmechanisms involving signals that break symmetry.\n",

We describe the cardiac muscle with\na three-dimensional map-based membrane potential model in lattices.

Our study captures healthy and pathological behaviors with fewer\nparameters and simpler equations than conductance models.

The\nbifurcation diagram of the single cell is very similar to that obtained in a\ndetailed conductance-based model. We find torsade de pointes, a clinical\nmanifestation of some types of tachycardia in the electrocardiogram, using a\ngeneric sampling of the whole network during spiral waves.

This review covers the advances of artificial\nintelligence applications in well-established techniques such as MRI and CT.\nAlso, it shows its high potential in combination with optical\nspectroscopy-based approaches that are under development for mobile,\nultra-fast, and low-invasive diagnostics.

However, there is no established criterion to select a suitable\nmodel for a specific application. Although the model that best fits the\nexperimental data can be deemed the most suitable model, this practice often\ncan be insufficient given the inter-sample variability of experimental\nobservations. Herein, we present a Bayesian approach to calculate the relative\nprobabilities of constitutive models based on biaxial mechanical testing of\ntissue samples. 46 samples of porcine aortic valve tissue were tested using a\nbiaxial stretching setup. For each sample, seven ratios of stresses along and\nperpendicular to the fiber direction were applied. The probabilities of eight\ninvariant-based constitutive models were calculated based on the experimental\ndata using the proposed model selection framework. The calculated probabilities\nshowed that, out of the considered models and based on the information\navailable through the utilized experimental dataset, the May--Newman model was\nthe most probable model for the porcine aortic valve data. When the samples\nwere grouped into different cusp types, the May--Newman model remained the most\nprobable for the left- and right-coronary cusps, whereas for non-coronary cusps\ntwo models were found to be equally probable: the Lee--Sacks model and the\nMay--Newman model. This difference between cusp types was found to be\nassociated with the first principal component analysis (PCA) mode, where this\nmode's amplitudes of the non-coronary and right-coronary cusps were found to be\nsignificantly different. Our results show that a PCA-based statistical model\ncan capture significant variations in the mechanical properties of soft\ntissues. The presented framework is applicable to any tissue type, and has the\npotential to provide a structured and rational way of making simulations\npopulation-based.\n",

In this study we generated and thoroughly characterized a large dataset of\nsynthetic 4D aortic velocity profiles suitable to be used as BCs for CFD\nsimulations. 4D flow MRI scans of 30 subjects with ATAA were processed to\nextract cross-sectional planes along the ascending aorta, ensuring spatial\nalignment among all planes and interpolating all velocity fields to a reference\nconfiguration. Velocity profiles of the clinical cohort were extensively\ncharacterized by computing flow morphology descriptors of both spatial and\ntemporal features. By exploiting principal component analysis (PCA), a\nstatistical shape model (SSM) of 4D aortic velocity profiles was built and a\ndataset of 437 synthetic cases with realistic properties was generated.\nComparison between clinical and synthetic datasets showed that the synthetic\ndata presented similar characteristics as the clinical population in terms of\nkey morphological parameters.

        "summary": "  Cardiac fluid dynamics fundamentally involves interactions between complex\nblood flows and the structural deformations of the muscular heart walls and the\nthin, flexible valve leaflets. There has been longstanding scientific,\nengineering, and medical interest in creating mathematical models of the heart\nthat capture, explain, and predict these fluid-structure interactions. However,\nexisting computational models that account for interactions among the blood,\nthe actively contracting myocardium, and the cardiac valves are limited in\ntheir abilities to predict valve performance, resolve fine-scale flow features,\nor use realistic descriptions of tissue biomechanics. Here we introduce and\nbenchmark a comprehensive mathematical model of cardiac fluid dynamics in the\nhuman heart. A unique feature of our model is that it incorporates\nbiomechanically detailed descriptions of all major cardiac structures that are\ncalibrated using tensile tests of human tissue specimens to reflect the heart's\nmicrostructure. Further, it is the first fluid-structure interaction model of\nthe heart that provides anatomically and physiologically detailed\nrepresentations of all four cardiac valves. We demonstrate that this\nintegrative model generates physiologic dynamics, including realistic\npressure-volume loops that automatically capture isovolumetric contraction and\nrelaxation, and predicts fine-scale flow features. None of these outputs are\nprescribed; instead, they emerge from interactions within our comprehensive\ndescription of cardiac physiology. Such models can serve as tools for\npredicting the impacts of medical devices or clinical interventions. They also\ncan serve as platforms for mechanistic studies of cardiac pathophysiology and\ndysfunction, including congenital defects, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure,\nthat are difficult or impossible to perform in patients.\n",

Computational modeling and analysis of these unique\ncardiac anatomies can improve diagnosis and treatment planning and may\nultimately lead to improved outcomes. Deep learning (DL) methods have\ndemonstrated the potential to enable efficient treatment planning by automating\ncardiac segmentation and mesh construction for patients with normal cardiac\nanatomies. However, CHDs are often rare, making it challenging to acquire\nsufficiently large patient cohorts for training such DL models. Generative\nmodeling of cardiac anatomies has the potential to fill this gap via the\ngeneration of virtual cohorts; however, prior approaches were largely designed\nfor normal anatomies and cannot readily capture the significant topological\nvariations seen in CHD patients. Therefore, we propose a type- and\nshape-disentangled generative approach suitable to capture the wide spectrum of\ncardiac anatomies observed in different CHD types and synthesize differently\nshaped cardiac anatomies that preserve the unique topology for specific CHD\ntypes. Our DL approach represents generic whole heart anatomies with CHD\ntype-specific abnormalities implicitly using signed distance fields (SDF) based\non CHD type diagnosis, which conveniently captures divergent anatomical\nvariations across different types and represents meaningful intermediate CHD\nstates. To capture the shape-specific variations, we then learn invertible\ndeformations to morph the learned CHD type-specific anatomies and reconstruct\npatient-specific shapes. Our approach has the potential to augment the\nimage-segmentation pairs for rarer CHD types for cardiac segmentation and\ngenerate cohorts of CHD cardiac meshes for computational simulation.\n",

Fluorescence guidance with\n5-ALA assists in reaching this goal. Using hyperspectral imaging, previous work\ncharacterized five fluorophores' emission spectra in most human brain tumors.\nIn this paper, the effectiveness of these five spectra was explored for\ndifferent tumor and tissue classification tasks in 184 patients (891\nhyperspectral measurements) harboring low- (n=30) and high-grade gliomas\n(n=115), non-glial primary brain tumors (n=19), radiation necrosis (n=2),\nmiscellaneous (n=10) and metastases (n=8). Four machine learning models were\ntrained to classify tumor type, grade, glioma margins and IDH mutation. Using\nrandom forests and multi-layer perceptrons, the classifiers achieved average\ntest accuracies of 84-87%, 96%, 86%, and 93% respectively. All five fluorophore\nabundances varied between tumor margin types and tumor grades (p < 0.01). For\ntissue type, at least four of the five fluorophore abundances were found to be\nsignificantly different (p < 0.01) between all classes. These results\ndemonstrate the fluorophores' differing abundances in different tissue classes,\nas well as the value of the five fluorophores as potential optical biomarkers,\nopening new opportunities for intraoperative classification systems in\nfluorescence-guided neurosurgery.\n",

Due to\nthe assumed two-phase nature of blood and specific features of red blood cells\n(RBCs), mathematical models for blood flow in the microcirculation are highly\nnonlinear, coupling the flow and RBC concentrations (haematocrit). In contrast\nto previous works which accomplished blood-flow homogenisation by assuming that\nthe haematocrit level remains constant, here we allow for spatial heterogeneity\nin the haematocrit concentration and thus begin with a nonlinear microscale\nmodel. We simplify the analysis by considering the limit of small haematocrit\nheterogeneity which prevails when variations in haematocrit concentration\nbetween neighbouring vessels are small. Homogenisation results in a system of\ncoupled, nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow and\nhaematocrit transport at the macroscale, in which a nonlinear Darcy-type model\nrelates the flow and pressure gradient via a haematocrit-dependent permeability\ntensor. During the analysis we obtain further that haematocrit transport at the\nmacroscale is governed by a purely advective equation. Applying the theory to\nparticular examples of two- and three-dimensional geometries of periodic\nnetworks, we calculate the effective permeability tensor associated with blood\nflow in these vascular networks. We demonstrate how the statistical\ndistribution of vessel lengths and diameters, together with the average\nhaematocrit level, affect the statistical properties of the macroscopic\npermeability tensor. These data can be used to simulate blood flow and\nhaematocrit transport at the macroscale.\n",

To boost the clinical deployment of\nensemble regression methods that quantify RV volumes using tabular data from\nthe widely available two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), we propose to\ncomplement the volume predictions with uncertainty scores. To this end, we\nemploy an instance-based method which uses the learned tree structure to\nidentify the nearest training samples to a target instance and then uses a\nnumber of distribution types to more flexibly model the output. The\nprobabilistic and point-prediction performances of the proposed framework are\nevaluated on a relatively small-scale dataset, comprising 100 end-diastolic and\nend-systolic RV volumes. The reference values for point performance were\nobtained from MRI. The results demonstrate that our flexible approach yields\nimproved probabilistic and point performances over other state-of-the-art\nmethods. The appropriateness of the proposed framework is showcased by\nproviding exemplar cases. The estimated uncertainty embodies both aleatoric and\nepistemic types.

Intestinal organoid morphogenesis\ninvolves a number of mechanochemical regulators, including cell-type specific\ncytoskeletal forces and osmotically-driven lumen volume changes. However,\nwhether and how these forces are coordinated in time and space via feedbacks to\nensure robust morphogenesis remains unclear. Here, we propose a minimal\nphysical model of organoid morphogenesis with local cellular mechano-sensation,\nwhere lumen volume changes can impact epithelial shape via both direct\nmechanical (passive) and indirect mechanosensitive (active) mechanisms. We show\nhow mechano-sensitive feedbacks on cytoskeletal tension generically give rise\nto morphological bistability, where both bulged (open) and budded (closed)\ncrypt states are possible and dependent on the history of volume changes. Such\nbistability can explain several paradoxical experimental observations, such as\nthe importance of the timing of lumen shrinkage and robustness of the final\nmorphogenetic state to mechanical perturbations. More quantitatively, we\nperformed mechanical and pharmacological experiments to validate the key\nmodelling assumptions and make quantitative predictions on organoid\nmorphogenesis. This suggests that bistability arising from feedbacks between\ncellular tensions and fluid pressure could be a general mechanism to allow for\nthe coordination of multicellular shape changes in developing systems.\n",

        "summary": "  Machine-learning (ML) models in flow cytometry have the potential to reduce\nerror rates, increase reproducibility, and boost the efficiency of clinical\nlabs. While numerous ML models for flow cytometry data have been proposed, few\nstudies have described the clinical deployment of such models. Realizing the\npotential gains of ML models in clinical labs requires not only an accurate\nmodel, but infrastructure for automated inference, error detection, analytics\nand monitoring, and structured data extraction. Here, we describe an ML model\nfor detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), along with the infrastructure\nsupporting clinical implementation. Our infrastructure leverages the resilience\nand scalability of the cloud for model inference, a Kubernetes-based workflow\nsystem that provides model reproducibility and resource management, and a\nsystem for extracting structured diagnoses from full-text reports. We also\ndescribe our model monitoring and visualization platform, an essential element\nfor ensuring continued model accuracy. Finally, we present a post-deployment\nanalysis of impacts on turn-around time and compare production accuracy to the\noriginal validation statistics.\n",

        "summary": "  Purpose: Iliac wing fractures due to lap belt loading have been observed in\nlaboratory settings for 50 years and recent data suggest they are also\noccurring in the field. Automated driving systems (ADS) and other occupant\ncompartment advancements are expected to offer enhanced flexibility in seating\norientation, which could place a greater reliance on the seatbelt to restrain\noccupants. Such changes may increase seatbelt loads and create new challenges\nin successfully restraining occupants and mitigating injury to areas such as\nthe pelvis. Injury criteria exist for component-level male iliac wing fractures\nresulting from frontal lap belt loading, but not for females. Methods: This\nstudy explored female iliac wing fracture tolerance in the same loading\nenvironment as a previous study that explored the fracture tolerance of\nisolated male iliac wings. Male and female fracture data were combined to\nevaluate the effect of sex. Injury risk functions were created by fitting\nWeibull survival models to data that integrated censored and exact failure\nobservations. Results: Twenty female iliac wings were tested; fourteen of them\nsustained fracture with known failure forces (exact), but the remaining six\nwings either (1) did not fracture, or (2) fractured after an event that changed\nthe boundary conditions (right censored). The fracture tolerance of the tested\nspecimens ranged widely (1134 - 8759 N) and averaged 4240 N (SD 2516 N).\nConclusion: Female data and combined male-female data were analyzed. Age was\nthe only covariate investigated in this study that had a statistically\nsignificant effect and improved the predictive performance of the models.\n",

        "summary": "  We study a system of particles in a two-dimensional geometry that move\naccording to a reinforced random walk with transition probabilities dependent\non the solutions of reaction-diffusion equations for the underlying fields. A\nbirth process and a history-dependent killing process are also considered. This\nsystem models tumor-induced angiogenesis, the process of formation of blood\nvessels induced by a growth factor released by a tumor. Particles represent\nvessel tip cells, whose trajectories constitute the growing vessel network. New\nvessels appear and may fuse with existing ones during their evolution. Thus,\nthe system is described by tracking the density of active tips, calculated as\nan ensemble average over many realizations of the stochastic process. Such\ndensity satisfies a novel discrete master equation with source and sink terms.\nThe sink term is proportional to a space-dependent and suitably fitted killing\ncoefficient. Results are illustrated studying two influential angiogenesis\nmodels.\n",

        "summary": "  Cancer development is a multistep process often starting with a single cell\nin which a number of epigenetic and genetic alterations have accumulated thus\ntransforming it into a tumor cell. The progeny of such a single benign tumor\ncell expands in the tissue and can at some point progress to malignant tumor\ncells until a detectable tumor is formed. The dynamics from the early phase of\na single cell to a detectable tumor with billions of tumor cells are complex\nand still not fully resolved, not even for the well-known prototype of\nmultistage carcinogenesis, the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence of colorectal\ncancer. Mathematical models of such carcinogenesis are frequently tested and\ncalibrated based on reported age-specific incidence rates of cancer, but they\nusually require calibration of four or more parameters due to the wide range of\nprocesses these models aim to reflect. We present a cell-based model, which\nfocuses on the competition between wild-type and tumor cells in colonic crypts,\nwith which we are able reproduce epidemiological incidence rates of colon\ncancer. Additionally, the fraction of cancerous tumors with precancerous\nlesions predicted by the model agree with clinical estimates. The\ncorrespondence between model and reported data suggests that the fate of tumor\ndevelopment is majorly determined by the early phase of tumor growth and\nprogression long before a tumor becomes detectable. Due to the focus on the\nearly phase of tumor development, the model has only a single fit parameter,\nthe time scale set by an effective replacement rate of stem cells in the crypt.\nWe find this effective rate to be considerable smaller than the actual\nreplacement rate, which implies that the time scale is limited by the processes\nsucceeding clonal conversion of crypts.\n",
