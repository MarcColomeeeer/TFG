Assuming a price sensitive\ndemand function with a random intercept, we provide comparative statics and\neconomic interpreta- tions for three models of demand (arithmetic Brownian,\ngeometric Brownian, and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross). Committed capacity, that is,\nthe installed capacity plus the in- vestment in the pipeline, must never drop\nbelow the best predictor of future demand, minus two biases. The discounting\nbias takes into account the fact that investment is paid upfront for future\nuse; the precautionary bias multiplies a type of risk aversion index by the\nlocal volatility. Relying on the analytical forms, we discuss in detail the\neconomic effects.\n",

In this model the particle follows a simple multi-step process in\nvelocity space which also preserves the proper state equation of motion. Many\nnumerical numerical examples of this process are provided. For a smaller grid\nthe probability construction converges into a correlated set of probabilities\nof hyperbolic functions for each velocity at each state point. It is shown that\nthe two dimensional process can be transformed into a Telegraph equation and\nvia transformation into a Klein-Gordon equation if the transition rates are\nconstant. In the last Section there is an example of multi-dimensional\nhyperbolic partial differential equation whose numerical average satisfies\nNewton's equation. There is also a momentum measure provided both for the\ntwo-dimensional case as for the multi-dimensional rate matrix.\n",

A key result is the uniqueness theorem for a positive eigenfunction of the\npricing operator such that X is recurrent under a new probability measure\nassociated with this eigenfunction (recurrent eigenfunction). As economic\napplications, we prove uniqueness of the Hansen and Scheinkman (2009)\nfactorization of the Markovian SDF corresponding to the recurrent\neigenfunction, extend the Recovery Theorem of Ross (2015) from discrete time,\nfinite state irreducible Markov chains to recurrent BRPs, and obtain the long\nmaturity asymptotics of the pricing operator.

The goal of this article is to provide\na unified view on both approaches. This is achieved by studying reduced-form\napproaches under weak assumptions. In particular we do not assume the global\nexistence of a default intensity and allow default at fixed or predictable\ntimes with positive probability, such as coupon payment dates.\n  In this generalized framework we study dynamic term structures prone to\ndefault risk following the forward-rate approach proposed in\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton (1992). It turns out, that previously considered models\nlead to arbitrage possibilities when default may happen at a predictable time\nwith positive probability. A suitable generalization of the forward-rate\napproach contains an additional stochastic integral with atoms at predictable\ntimes and necessary and sufficient conditions for a suitable no-arbitrage\ncondition (NAFL) are given. In the view of efficient implementations we develop\na new class of affine models which do not satisfy the standard assumption of\nstochastic continuity.\n  The chosen approach is intimately related to the theory of enlargement of\nfiltrations, to which we provide a small example by means of filtering theory\nwhere the Azema supermartingale contains upward and downward jumps, both at\npredictable and totally inaccessible stopping times.\n",

By exhibiting a Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve expansion\nfor the integrated variance, and using sharp estimates of the density of a\ngeneral second-chaos variable, we derive asymptotics for the asset price\ndensity for large or small values of the variable, and study the wing behavior\nof the implied volatility in these models. Our main result provides explicit\nexpressions for the first five terms in the expansion of the implied\nvolatility. The expressions for the leading three terms are simple, and based\non three basic spectral-type statistics of the Gaussian process: the top\neigenvalue of its covariance operator, the multiplicity of this eigenvalue, and\nthe $L^{2}$ norm of the projection of the mean function on the top eigenspace.\nThe fourth term requires knowledge of all eigen-elements. We present detailed\nnumerics based on realistic liquidity assumptions in which classical and\nlong-memory volatility models are calibrated based on our expansion.\n",

This allows us, for the first\ntime, to model the precise structure of an arbitrary financial market and to\nderive the corresponding expected exposure in a closed-form expression. It\nfurther enables us to draw implications for the study of systemic risk.

The introduced network model is then applied to study the\nfeatures of an over-the-counter and a centrally cleared market. We also give a\nmore general answer to the question of whether it is more advantageous for the\noverall counterparty credit risk to clear via a central counterparty or\nclassically bilateral between the two involved counterparties.

        "summary": "  We formulate and analyze a multi-agent model for the evolution of individual\nand systemic risk in which the local agents interact with each other through a\ncentral agent who, in turn, is influenced by the mean field of the local\nagents. The central agent is stabilized by a bistable potential, the only\nstabilizing force in the system. The local agents derive their stability only\nfrom the central agent. In the mean field limit of a large number of local\nagents we show that the systemic risk decreases when the strength of the\ninteraction of the local agents with the central agent increases. This means\nthat the probability of transition from one of the two stable quasi-equilibria\nto the other one decreases. We also show that the systemic risk increases when\nthe strength of the interaction of the central agent with the mean field of the\nlocal agents increases. Following the financial interpretation of such models\nand their behavior given in our previous paper (Garnier, Papanicolaou and Yang,\nSIAM J. Fin. Math. 4, 2013, 151-184), we may interpret the results of this\npaper in the following way. From the point of view of systemic risk, and while\nkeeping the perceived risk of the local agents approximately constant, it is\nbetter to strengthen the interaction of the local agents with the central agent\nthan the other way around.\n",

The cashflow bundle is the vector bundle associated to this\nstochastic principal fibre bundle for the natural choice of the vector space\nfibre. The cashflow bundle carries a stochastic covariant differentiation\ninduced by the connection on the principal fibre bundle. The link between\narbitrage theory and spectral theory of the connection Laplacian on the vector\nbundle is given by the zero eigenspace resulting in a parametrization of all\nrisk neutral measures equivalent to the statistical one. This indicates that a\nmarket satisfies the (NFLVR) condition if and only if $0$ is in the discrete\nspectrum of the connection Laplacian on the cash flow bundle or of the Dirac\nLaplacian of the twisted cash flow bundle with the exterior algebra bundle. We\napply this result by extending Jarrow-Protter-Shimbo theory of asset bubbles\nfor complete arbitrage free markets to markets not satisfying the (NFLVR).\nMoreover, by means of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, we prove that the Euler\ncharacteristic of the asset nominal space is a topological obstruction to the\nthe (NFLVR) condition, and, by means of the Bochner-Weitzenb\\\"ock formula, the\nnon vanishing of the homology group of the cash flow bundle is revealed to be a\ntopological obstruction to (NFLVR), too.

Neuberger (2007, `Bounds on the American option') and\nHobson and Neuberger (2016, `On the value of being American') argue that the\ncost of the cheapest super-replicating strategy is equal to the highest\nmodel-based price, where we search over all models which price correctly the\ngiven European options. Bayraktar, Huang and Zhou (2015, `On hedging American\noptions under model uncertainty', SIAM J.

By using\nan analogy to a physical model, we study this system in the classical and\nquantum frameworks. Classically, the dynamic optimization problem is equivalent\nto a classical mechanics constrained system, so we must use the Dirac method to\nanalyze it in a correct way. We find that there are two second-class\nconstraints in the model: one fix the momenta associated with the control\nvariables, and the other is a reminder of the optimal control law. The dynamic\nevolution of this constrained system is given by the Dirac's bracket of the\ncanonical variables with the Hamiltonian. This dynamic results to be identical\nto the unconstrained one given by the Pontryagin equations, which are the\ncorrect classical equations of motion for our physical optimization problem. In\nthe same Pontryagin scheme, by imposing a closed-loop $\\lambda$-strategy, the\noptimality condition for the action gives a consistency relation, which is\nassociated to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the dynamic programming\nmethod. A similar result is achieved by quantizing the classical model. By\nsetting the wave function $\\Psi(x,t) = e^{iS(x,t)}$ in the quantum\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, a non-linear partial equation is obtained for the $S$\nfunction. For the right-hand side quantization, this is the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, when $S(x,t)$ is identified with the optimal\nvalue function. Thus, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in Bellman's maximum\nprinciple, can be interpreted as the quantum approach of the optimization\nproblem.\n",

In particular, we consider an\nendowment insurance contract, that is a combination of a term insurance policy\nand a pure endowment, whose final value depends on the trend of a stock market\nwhere the premia the policyholder pays are invested. We assume that the stock\nprice process dynamics depends on an exogenous unobservable stochastic factor\nthat also influences the mortality rate of the policyholder. To allow for\nmutual dependence between the financial and the insurance markets, we use the\nprogressive enlargement of filtration approach. We characterize the optimal\nhedging strategy in terms of the integrand in the Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe\ndecomposition of the insurance claim with respect to the minimal martingale\nmeasure and the available information flow. We provide an explicit formula by\nmeans of predictable projection of the corresponding hedging strategy under\nfull information with respect to the natural filtration of the risky asset\nprice and the minimal martingale measure. Finally, we discuss applications in a\nMarkovian setting via filtering.\n",

A set in the\nOrlicz space $L^\\Phi$ is said to be order closed if it is closed with respect\nto dominated convergence of sequences of functions. A well known problem\narising from the theory of risk measures in financial mathematics asks whether\norder closedness of a convex set in $L^\\Phi$ characterizes closedness with\nrespect to the topology $\\sigma(L^\\Phi,L^\\Psi)$. (See [26, p.3585].) In this\npaper, we show that for a norm bounded convex set in $L^\\Phi$, order closedness\nand $\\sigma(L^\\Phi,L^\\Psi)$-closedness are indeed equivalent. In general,\nhowever, coincidence of order closedness and $\\sigma(L^\\Phi,L^\\Psi)$-closedness\nof convex sets in $L^\\Phi$ is equivalent to the validity of the Krein-Smulian\nTheorem for the topology $\\sigma(L^\\Phi,L^\\Psi)$; that is, a convex set is\n$\\sigma(L^\\Phi,L^\\Psi)$-closed if and only if it is closed with respect to the\nbounded-$\\sigma(L^\\Phi,L^\\Psi)$ topology. As a result, we show that order\nclosedness and $\\sigma(L^\\Phi,L^\\Psi)$-closedness of convex sets in $L^\\Phi$\nare equivalent if and only if either $\\Phi$ or $\\Psi$ satisfies the\n$\\Delta_2$-condition. Using this, we prove the surprising result that: \\emph{If\n(and only if) $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ both fail the $\\Delta_2$-condition, then there\nexists a coherent risk measure on $L^\\Phi$ that has the Fatou property but\nfails the Fenchel-Moreau dual representation with respect to the dual pair\n$(L^\\Phi, L^\\Psi)$}.

When\nderivatives are priced, considering different lending/borrowing rates leads to\nsemi-linear BSDEs and PDEs, and thus it is necessary to solve the equations\nnumerically. However, once it can be guaranteed that only one of the rates\naffects pricing, linear equations can be recovered and analytical formulae can\nbe derived. Moreover, as a byproduct, our results explain how debt value\nadjustment (DVA) and funding benefits are dissimilar. It is often believed that\nconsidering both DVA and funding benefits results in a double-counting issue\nbut it will be shown that the two components are affected by different\nmathematical structures of derivative transactions. We find that funding\nbenefit is related to the decreasing property of the payoff function, but this\nrelationship decreases as the funding choices of underlying assets are\ntransferred to repo markets.\n",

When applied to two\nfactor models, RMQ is inefficient due to the fact that the optimization problem\nis usually performed using stochastic methods, e.g., Lloyd's algorithm or\nCompetitive Learning Vector Quantization. In this paper, a new algorithm is\nproposed that allows RMQ to be applied to two-factor stochastic volatility\nmodels, which retains the efficiency of gradient-descent techniques. By\nmargining over potential realizations of the volatility process, a significant\ndecrease in computational effort is achieved when compared to current\nquantization methods. Additionally, techniques for modelling the correct\nzero-boundary behaviour are used to allow the new algorithm to be applied to\ncases where the previous methods would fail. The proposed technique is\nillustrated for European options on the Heston and Stein-Stein models, while a\nmore thorough application is considered in the case of the popular SABR model,\nwhere various exotic options are also priced.\n",

A distinctive feature of this\nfamily of games is the fact that the agents do not have any exogenously given\nfundamental value for the asset, and they deduce the value of their position\nfrom the bid and ask prices posted by other agents (i.e. they are pure\nspeculators). As a result, in such a game, the reward function of each agent,\nat the time of stopping, depends directly on the controls of other players. The\nequilibrium problem leads naturally to a system of coupled control-stopping\nproblems (or, equivalently, Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential\nEquations (RBSDEs)), in which the individual reward functions (or, reflecting\nbarriers) depend on the value functions (or, solution components) of other\nagents. The resulting system, in general, presents multiple mathematical\nchallenges due to the non-standard form of coupling (or, reflection). In the\npresent case, this system is also complicated by the fact that the continuous\ncontrols of the agents, describing their posted bid and ask prices, are\nconstrained to take values in a discrete grid. The latter feature reflects the\npresence of a positive tick size in the market, and it creates additional\ndiscontinuities in the agents reward functions (or, reflecting barriers).\nHerein, we prove the existence of a solution to the associated system in a\nspecial Markovian framework, provide numerical examples, and discuss the\npotential applications.\n",

Two agents, who do not trade the stock, have differing\ninformation on the change point, and seek to optimally exercise the option by\nmaximising its discounted payoff under the physical measure. The first agent\nhas full information, and observes the change point. The second agent has\npartial information and filters the change point from price observations. This\nscenario is designed to mimic the positions of two employees of varying\nseniority, a fully informed executive and a partially informed less senior\nemployee, each of whom receives an ESO. The partial information scenario yields\na model under the observation filtration $\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}$ in which the\nstock drift becomes a diffusion driven by the innovations process, an\n$\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}$-Brownian motion also driving the stock under\n$\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}$, and the partial information optimal stopping value\nfunction has two spatial dimensions. We rigorously characterise the free\nboundary PDEs for both agents, establish shape and regularity properties of the\nassociated optimal exercise boundaries, and prove the smooth pasting property\nin both information scenarios, exploiting some stochastic flow ideas to do so\nin the partial information case. We develop finite difference algorithms to\nnumerically solve both agents' exercise and valuation problems and illustrate\nthat the additional information of the fully informed agent can result in\nexercise patterns which exploit the information on the change point, lending\ncredence to empirical studies which suggest that privileged information of bad\nnews is a factor leading to early exercise of ESOs prior to poor stock price\nperformance.\n",

The proposed framework precludes arbitrage within each\nmarket, while the definition of a curve-conversion factor process links all\nmarkets in a consistent arbitrage-free manner.

The survival probability has to be known in closed form (for\ncalibration purposes), the model should be able to fit any valid Credit Default\nSwap (CDS) curve, should lead to large volatilities (in line with CDS options)\nand finally should be able to feature significant Wrong-Way Risk (WWR) impact.\nThe Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model (CIR) combined with independent positive jumps and\ndeterministic shift (JCIR++) is a very good candidate : the variance (and thus\ncovariance with exposure, i.e. WWR) can be increased with the jumps, whereas\nthe calibration constraint is achieved via the shift. In practice however,\nthere is a strong limit on the model parameters that can be chosen, and thus on\nthe resulting WWR impact. This is because only non-negative shifts are allowed\nfor consistency reasons, whereas the upwards jumps of the JCIR++ need to be\ncompensated by a downward shift. To limit this problem, we consider the\ntwo-side jump model recently introduced by Mendoza-Arriaga \\& Linetsky, built\nby time-changing CIR intensities. In a multivariate setup like CVA,\ntime-changing the intensity partly kills the potential correlation with the\nexposure process and destroys WWR impact. Moreover, it can introduce a forward\nlooking effect that can lead to arbitrage opportunities. In this paper, we use\nthe time-changed CIR process in a way that the above issues are avoided. We\nshow that the resulting process allows to introduce a large WWR effect compared\nto the JCIR++ model.

This framework includes the situation where the correlation between\nthe market model and the time of death is arbitrary general, and hence leads to\nthe case of a market model where there are two levels of information. The\npublic information which is generated by the financial assets, and a larger\nflow of information that contains additional knowledge about a death time of an\ninsured. By enlarging the filtration, the death uncertainty and its entailed\nrisk are fully considered without any mathematical restriction.\n  Our key tool lies in our optional martingale representation that states that\nany martingale in the large filtration stopped at the death time can be\ndecomposed into precise orthogonal local martingales. This allows us to derive\nthe dynamics of the value processes of the mortality/longevity securities used\nfor the securitization, and to decompose any mortality/longevity liability into\nthe sum of orthogonal risks by means of a risk basis. The first main\ncontribution of this paper resides in quantifying, as explicit as possible, the\neffect of mortality uncertainty on the risk-minimizing strategy by determining\nthe optimal strategy in the enlarged filtration in terms of strategies in the\nsmaller filtration.

The deterministic shift extension of the latter (Hull-White or\nJCIR++) is a simple but yet efficient solution that is widely used by both\nacademics and practitioners. However, the shift approach is often not\nappropriate when positivity is required, which is a common constraint when\ndealing with credit spreads or default intensities. In this paper, we tackle\nthis problem by adopting a time change approach. On the top of providing an\nelegant solution to the calibration problem under positivity constraint, our\nmodel features additional interesting properties in terms of implied\nvolatilities. It is compared to the shift extension on various credit risk\napplications such as credit default swap, credit default swaption and credit\nvaluation adjustment under wrong-way risk. The time change approach is able to\ngenerate much larger volatility and covariance effects under the positivity\nconstraint.

In case this function is quadratic, optimal policy is given by\nsystem of 3 PDE. In addition we show, that for small $\\epsilon$ costs of\nselling portfolio in time $T$ be important ($O(\\epsilon)$) and shouldn't be\nneglected in Value function ($o(\\epsilon^k)$- our result).\n",

        "summary": "  The subject of this paper is an optimal consumption/optimal portfolio problem\nwith transaction costs and with multiple risky assets.\n  In our model the transaction costs take a special form in that transaction\ncosts on purchases of one of the risky assets (the endowed asset) are infinite,\nand transaction costs involving the other risky assets are zero. Effectively,\nthe endowed asset can only be sold. In general, multi-asset optional\nconsumption/optimal portfolio problems are very challenging, but the extra\nstructure we introduce allows us to make significant progress towards an\nanalytical solution.\n  For an agent with CRRA utility we completely characterise the different types\nof optimal behaviours. These include always selling the entire holdings of the\nendowed asset immediately, selling the endowed asset whenever the ratio of the\nvalue of the holdings of the endowed asset to other wealth gets above a\ncritical ratio, and selling the endowed asset only when other wealth is zero.\nThis characterisation is in terms of solutions of a boundary crossing problem\nfor a first order ODE. The technical contribution is to show that the problem\nof solving the HJB equation, which is a second order, non-linear PDE subject to\nsmooth fit at an unknown free boundary, can be reduced to this much simpler\nproblem involving an explicit first order ODE. This technical contribution is\nat the heart of our analytical and numerical results, and allows us to prove\nmonotonicity of the critical exercise threshold and the certainty equivalent\nvalue in the model parameters.\n",

After choosing an optimal\nsize for a rolling window, the historical market data in this window is seen\nevery trading day as a random matrix from which a covariance and a correlation\nmatrix are obtained. The financial crisis indicators that we have built deal\nwith the spectral properties of these covariance and correlation matrices and\nthey are of two kinds. The first one is based on the Hellinger distance,\ncomputed between the distribution of the eigenvalues of the empirical\ncovariance matrix and the distribution of the eigenvalues of a reference\ncovariance matrix representing either a calm or agitated market. The idea\nbehind this first type of indicators is that when the empirical distribution of\nthe spectrum of the covariance matrix is deviating from the reference in the\nsense of Hellinger, then a crisis may be forthcoming. The second type of\nindicators is based on the study of the spectral radius and the trace of the\ncovariance and correlation matrices as a mean to directly study the volatility\nand correlations inside the market. The idea behind the second type of\nindicators is the fact that large eigenvalues are a sign of dynamic\ninstability. The predictive power of the financial crisis indicators in this\nframework is then demonstrated, in particular by using them as decision-making\ntools in a protective-put strategy.\n",

Here we drop the\nassumption of absolute continuity with respect to the Lebesgue measure and only\nassume that the compensator is absolutely continuous with respect to a general\n$\\sigma$-finite measure. This allows for example to incorporate the\nMerton-model in the generalized intensity based framework. An extension of the\nBlack-Cox model is also considered. We propose a class of generalized Merton\nmodels and study absence of arbitrage by a suitable modification of the forward\nrate approach of Heath-Jarrow-Morton (1992). Finally, we study affine term\nstructure models which fit in this class. They exhibit stochastic\ndiscontinuities in contrast to the affine models previously studied in the\nliterature.\n",

        "summary": "  An interacting Black-Scholes model for option pricing, where the usual\nconstant interest rate r is replaced by a stochastic time dependent rate r(t)\nof the form r(t)=r+f(t) dW/dt, accounting for market imperfections and prices\nnon-alignment, was developed in [1]. The white noise amplitude f(t), called\narbitrage bubble, generates a time dependent potential U(t) which changes the\nusual equilibrium dynamics of the traditional Black-Scholes model. The purpose\nof this article is to tackle the inverse problem, that is, is it possible to\nextract the time dependent potential U(t) and its associated bubble shape f(t)\nfrom the real empirical financial data? In order to give an answer to this\nquestion, the interacting Black-Scholes equation must be interpreted as a\nquantum Schrodinger equation with hamiltonian operator H=H0+U(t), where H0 is\nthe equilibrium Black-Scholes hamiltonian and U(t) is the interaction term. If\nthe U(t) term is small enough, the interaction potential can be thought as a\nperturbation, so one can compute the solution of the interacting Black-Scholes\nequation in an approximate form by perturbation theory. In [2] by applying the\nsemi-classical considerations, an approximate solution of the non equilibrium\nBlack-Scholes equation for an arbitrary bubble shape f(t) was developed. Using\nthis semi-classical solution and the knowledge about the mispricing of the\nfinancial data, one can determinate an equation, which solutions permit obtain\nthe functional form of the potential term U(t) and its associated bubble f(t).\nIn all the studied cases, the non equilibrium model performs a better\nestimation of the real data than the usual equilibrium model. It is expected\nthat this new and simple methodology for calibrating and simulating option\npricing solutions in the presence of market imperfections, could help to\nimprove option pricing estimations.\n",

Its popularity\narose from a tractable asymptotic expansion for implied volatility, derived by\nheat kernel methods. As markets moved to historically low rates, this expansion\nappeared to yield inconsistent prices. Since the model is deeply embedded in\nmarket practice, alternative pricing methods for SABR have been addressed in\nnumerous approaches in recent years. All standard option pricing methods make\ncertain regularity assumptions on the underlying model, but for SABR these are\nrarely satisfied. We examine here regularity properties of the model from this\nperspective with view to a number of (asymptotic and numerical) option pricing\nmethods. In particular, we highlight delicate degeneracies of the SABR model\n(and related processes) at the origin, which deem the currently used popular\nheat kernel methods and all related methods from (sub-) Riemannian geometry\nill-suited for SABR-type processes, when interest rates are near zero. We\ndescribe a more general semigroup framework, which permits to derive a suitable\ngeometry for SABR-type processes (in certain parameter regimes) via symmetric\nDirichlet forms. Furthermore, we derive regularity properties (Feller-\nproperties and strong continuity properties) necessary for the applicability of\npopular numerical schemes to SABR-semigroups, and identify suitable Banach- and\nHilbert spaces for these. Finally, we comment on the short time and large time\nasymptotic behaviour of SABR-type processes beyond the heat-kernel framework.\n",

It is considered to be a generic stochastic\ndynamic for the arbitrage bubble, and a generalized Black--Scholes equation is\nthen derived. The resulting equation is similar to that of the stochastic\nvolatility models, but there are no undetermined parameters as the market price\nof risk. The proposed theory has asymptotic behaviors that are associated with\nthe weak and strong arbitrage bubble limits. For the case where the arbitrage\nbubble's volatility is zero (deterministic bubble), the weak limit corresponds\nto the usual Black-Scholes model. The strong limit case also give a\nBlack--Scholes model, but the underlying asset's mean value replaces the\ninterest rate. When the bubble is stochastic, the theory also has weak and\nstrong asymptotic limits that give rise to option price dynamics that are\nsimilar to the Black--Scholes model. Explicit formulas are derived for Gaussian\nand lognormal stochastic bubbles.

Tractable alternatives based on resampling techniques have been\nproposed by the industry, but they lack mathematical foundations. This probably\nexplains why WWR is not explicitly handled in the Basel III regulatory\nframework in spite of its acknowledged importance. The purpose of this paper is\nto propose a new method consisting of an appealing compromise: we start from a\nstochastic intensity approach and end up with a pricing problem where WWR does\nnot enter the picture explicitly. This result is achieved thanks to a set of\nchanges of measure: the WWR effect is now embedded in the drift of the\nexposure, and this adjustment can be approximated by a deterministic function\nwithout affecting the level of accuracy typically required for CVA figures. The\nperformances of our approach are illustrated through an extensive comparison of\nExpected Positive Exposure (EPE) profiles and CVA figures produced either by\n(i) the standard method relying on a full bivariate Monte Carlo framework and\n(ii) our drift-adjustment approximation.

In most of the literature, the mean-risk problem is\nscalarized and it is well known that this scalarized problem does not satisfy\nthe (scalar) Bellman's principle. Thus, the classical dynamic programming\nmethods are not applicable. For the purpose of this paper we focus on the\ndiscrete time setup, and we will use a time consistent dynamic convex risk\nmeasure to evaluate the risk of a portfolio. We will show that when we do not\nscalarize the problem, but leave it in its original form as a vector\noptimization problem, the upper images, whose boundary contains the efficient\nfrontier, recurse backwards in time under very mild assumptions. Thus, the\ndynamic mean-risk problem does satisfy a Bellman's principle, but a more\ngeneral one, that seems more appropriate for a vector optimization problem: a\nset-valued Bellman's principle. We will present conditions under which this\nrecursion can be exploited directly to compute a solution in the spirit of\ndynamic programming. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed method.

This can be related\nto the conventional Ito calculus-based framework through the time integral of a\nprice's squared volatility, or `cumulative variance'. In the new framework,\ncorresponding processes are strictly increasing, solve random ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), and are composed with geometric Brownian motion.\nThe new framework has no dependence on stochastic calculus, so processes can be\nstudied on a pathwise basis using probability-free ODE techniques and\nfunctional analysis.\n  The ODEs considered depend on continuous driving functions which are\n`spatially irregular', meaning they need not have any spatial regularity\nproperties such as Holder continuity. They are however strictly increasing in\ntime, thus temporally asymmetric. When sensible initial values are chosen,\ninitial value problem (IVP) solutions are also strictly increasing, and the\nsolution set of such IVPs is shown to contain all differentiable bijections on\nthe non-negative reals. This enables the modelling of any non-negative\nvolatility path which is not zero over intervals, via the time derivative of\nsolutions. Despite this generality, new well-posedness results establish the\nuniqueness of solutions going forwards in time.\n  Motivation to explore this framework comes from its connection with a\ntime-changed Heston volatility model. The framework shows how Heston price\nprocesses can converge to a generalisation of the NIG Levy process, and reveals\na deeper relationship between integrated CIR processes and the IG process.\nWithin this framework, a `Riemann-Liouville-Heston' martingale model is defined\nwhich generalises these relationships to fractional counterparts. This model's\nimplied volatilities are simulated, and exhibit features characteristic of\nleading volatility models.\n",

More general models with arbitrary state\ndynamics and endogenous volatilities lead to multidimensional systems of\nnonlinear, fully-coupled forward-backward SDEs.

In a\ncalibration to time series of prices and trading volume, realistic liquidity\npremia are accompanied by a moderate increase in volatility. The effects of\ndifferent cost specifications are rather similar, justifying the use of\nquadratic costs as a proxy for other less tractable specifications.\n",

In other terms, if the EUR/USD\nFX rate follows a given type of dynamics, under which conditions will USD/EUR\nfollow the same type of dynamics? In order to give a numerical description of\nthis property, we first calibrate a Heston model and a SABR model to market\ndata, plotting their smiles together with the smiles of the reciprocal\nprocesses. Secondly, we determine a suitable local volatility structure\nensuring consistency. We subsequently introduce jumps and analyze both constant\njump size (Poisson process) and random jump size (compound Poisson process). In\nthe first scenario, we find that consistency is automatically satisfied, for\nthe jump size of the inverted process is a constant as well. The second case is\nmore delicate, since we need to make sure that the distribution of jumps in the\ndomestic measure is the same as the distribution of jumps in the foreign\nmeasure. We determine a fairly general class of admissible densities for the\njump size in the domestic measure satisfying the condition.\n",

An alternate approach in the context of option pricing and\ncalibration of implied volatility is the addition of a few other factors to the\nvolatility process. This paper contemplates two extensions of the Heston\nstochastic volatility model. Out of which, one considers the addition of jumps\nto the stock price process (a stochastic volatility jump diffusion model) and\nanother considers an additional stochastic volatility factor varying at a\ndifferent time scale (a multiscale stochastic volatility model). An empirical\nanalysis is carried out on the market data of options with different strike\nprices and maturities, to compare the pricing performance of these models and\nto capture their implied volatility fit. The unknown parameters of these models\nare calibrated using the non-linear least square optimization.

A key feature of the\npresent paper is that it relaxes the assumption of fixed proportions invested\nin tontine and bequest accounts. In making the bequest proportion an additional\ncontrol function I obtain, hitherto unavailable, closed-form solutions for the\nfractional consumption rate, wealth, bequest amount, and bequest proportion\nunder a constant relative risk averse utility. I show that the optimal bequest\nproportion is the product of the optimum fractional consumption rate and an\nexponentiated bequest parameter. I show that under certain circumstances, such\nas a very high bequest motive, a life-cycle utility maximisation strategy will\nnecessitate negative mortality credits analogous to a member paying life\ninsurance premiums. Typical scenarios are explored using UK Office of National\nStatistics life tables.\n",

The limits agree with\npublished results. Then we derive a formulation that allows a more general\nstochastic drift and diffusion including one or more stochastic local\nvolatility terms.

Capital injection takes place at the draw-down time of\nthe surplus process when it drops below a pre-specified function of its last\nrecord maximum. The capital is continuously paid to keep the surplus above the\ndraw-down level until either the surplus process goes above the record high or\na Parisian type ruin occurs, which is announced at the first instance the\nsurplus process has undergone an excursion below the record for an independent\nexponential period of time consecutively since the time the capital was first\ninjected. Some distributional identities concerning the excursion are\npresented. Firstly, we give the Parisian ruin probability and the joint Laplace\ntransform (possibly killed at the first passage time above a fixed level of the\nsurplus process) of the ruin time, surplus position at ruin, and the total\ncapital injection at ruin. Secondly, we obtain the $q$-potential measure of the\nsurplus process killed at Parisian ruin. Finally, we give expected present\nvalue of the total discounted capital payments up to the Parisian ruin time.\nThe results are derived using recent developments in fluctuation and excursion\ntheory of spectrally negative Levy process and are presented semi explicitly in\nterms of the scale function of the Levy process. Some numerical examples are\ngiven to facilitate the analysis of the impact of initial surplus and frequency\nof observation period to the ruin probability and to the expected total capital\ninjection.\n",

The optimal contracts are expressed by a double-obstacle\nordinary differential equation for a semi-linear second-order elliptic operator\nwith nonlocal boundary conditions.

In this\npaper, we develop a calibration technique based on a partial differential\nequation (PDE) approach which allows an efficient implementation. The essential\nidea is based on solving the derived forward equation satisfied by P(t; S;\nr)Z(t; S; r), where P(t; S; r) represents the risk neutral probability density\nof (S(t); r(t)) and Z(t; S; r) the projection of the stochastic discounting\nfactor in the state variables (S(t); r(t)).

The G-Brownian motion represents the uncertainty about the\nvolatility. Within this framework, we derive a sufficient condition for the\nabsence of arbitrage, known as the drift condition. In contrast to the\ntraditional model, the drift condition consists of several equations and\nseveral market prices, termed market price of risk and market prices of\nuncertainty, respectively. The drift condition is still consistent with the\nclassical one if there is no volatility uncertainty. Similar to the traditional\nmodel, the risk-neutral dynamics of the forward rate are completely determined\nby its diffusion term.

Since\ngeometric mean, or its counterpart median for the log-normal distribution, does\nnot suffer from this drawback, it provides us with a more appropriate measure\nespecially for evaluating long-term outcomes dominated by outliers.

We\nassume that the buyer is risk neutral investor trying to maximize the expected\nmonetary value of the option over a class of stopping time. We discuss optimal\nsolution to the stopping problem when the source of uncertainty of the asset\nprice is modelled by L\\'evy process with only downward jumps. Using recent\ndevelopment in excursion theory of L\\'evy process, the results are given\nexplicitly in terms of scale function of the L\\'evy process.

In this paper, we study the relevance of conic\nmartingales-driven default models for practical applications in credit risk\nmodeling. We first introduce an arbitrage-free conic martingale, namely the\n$\\Phi$-martingale, by showing that it fits in the class of Dynamized Gaussian\ncopula model of Cr\\'epey et al., thereby providing an explicit construction\nscheme for the default time. In particular, the $\\Phi$-martingale features\ninteresting properties inherent on its construction easing the practical\nimplementation.

In addition,\nwe show how classical results from Merton's portfolio optimisation problem can\nbe used to help motivate the construction of the solution in both cases. The\noptimal strategy under both approaches is then derived in a semi-closed form,\nand comparisons between the results made.

Depending on\nthe model, the producer can control the drift and/or the volatility of the\nprice whereas the trader can at most affect the volatility. The producer can\naffect the volatility in two ways: either by randomizing her production rate\nor, as the trader, using other means such as spreading false information.\nMoreover, the producer contracts at time zero a fixed position in a European\nconvex derivative with the trader. The trader can be price-taker, as in the\nfirst two models, or she can also affect the volatility of the commodity price,\nas in the third model. We solve all three models semi--explicitly and give\nclosed--form expressions of the derivative price over a small time horizon,\npreventing arbitrage opportunities to arise. We find that when the trader is\nprice-taker, the producer can always compensate the loss in expected production\nprofit generated by an increase of volatility by a gain in the derivative\nposition by driving the price at maturity to a suitable level. Finally, in case\nthe trader is active, the model takes the form of a nonzero-sum\nlinear-quadratic stochastic differential game and we find that when the\nproduction rate is already at its optimal stationary level, there is an amount\nof derivative position that makes both players better off when entering the\ngame.\n",

There is broad agreement\nin the literature that the effect should be present for theoretical reasons,\nand it has been consistently found in empirical work. However, a few papers\nhave pointed out a puzzle: the return distributions of many assets do not\nappear to be affected by the leverage effect. We analyze the determinants of\nthe return distribution and find that the impact of the leverage effect comes\nprimarily from an interaction between the leverage effect and the\nmean-reversion effect. When the leverage effect is large and the mean-reversion\neffect is small, then the interaction exerts a strong effect on the return\ndistribution. However, if the mean-reversion effect is large, even a large\nleverage effect has little effect on the return distribution. To better\nunderstand the impact of the interaction effect, we propose an indirect method\nto measure it. We apply our methodology to empirical data and find that the S&P\n500 data exhibits a weak interaction effect, and consequently its returns\ndistribution is little impacted by the leverage effect. Furthermore, the\ninteraction effect is closely related to the size factor: small firms tend to\nhave a strong interaction effect and large firms tend to have a weak\ninteraction effect.\n",

Mathematically, we study the\noptimal stopping of the utility of an asset sale with a random discounting that\ncaptures the investor's overall impatience. The random discounting is given by\nthe cumulative amount of time spent by the drawdowns in an undesirable high\nregion, fine tuned by the investor's personal tolerance and anxiety about\ndrawdowns. We prove that in addition to the traditional take-profit sales, the\nreal-life employed stop-loss orders and trailing stops may become part of the\noptimal selling strategy, depending on different personal characteristics. This\npaper thus provides insights on the effect of anxiety and its distinction with\ntraditional risk aversion on decision making.\n",

Under the assumption of piecewise-constant parameters, our\napproximation formulas become closed-form, and moreover we are able to\nestablish a fast calibration scheme.

Some\nattention has nevertheless been paid using an experimental and game theory\napproach. We, instead, take a mathematical approach to the issue of an optimal\ngroup size, where the goal is to minimize the probability of default of the\ngroup. To do this, one has to create a model with interacting forces, and to\nmake precise the hypotheses of the model. We show that the original choice of\nMuhammad Yunus, of a group size of five people, is, under the right, and, we\nbelieve, reasonable hypotheses, either close to optimal, or even at times\nexactly optimal, i.e., the optimal group size is indeed five people.\n",

The change has the potential to disrupt the $200\ntrillion market of derivatives and debt tied to the LIBOR. The only SOFR linked\nderivative with any significant liquidity and trading history is the SOFR\nfutures contract, traded at the CME since 2018. We use the historical record of\nfutures prices to construct dynamic arbitrage-free models for the SOFR term\nstructure. The models allow you to construct forward-looking SOFR term rates,\nimply a SOFR discounting curve and price and risk and risk manage SOFR\nderivatives, not yet liquidly traded in the market. We find that a standard\nthree-factor Gaussian arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel model describes term rates\nvery well but a shadow-rate extension is needed to describe the behaviour near\nthe zero-boundary. We also find that the jumps and seasonal effects observed in\nSOFR, do not need to be specifically accounted for in a model for the futures\nprices. Finally we study the so-called convexity correction and find that it\nbecomes significant beyond the 2 year maturity. For validation purposes we\ndemonstrate that our model aligns closely with the methodology used by the\nFederal Reserve to publish indicative SOFR term rates.\n",

We derive an asymptotic expansion of the implied volatility as the\ntime-to-maturity tends to zero. For this purpose we introduce a new approach to\nvalidate such an expansion, which enables us to treat more general models than\nin the literature.

We\ncomplete the stochastic intensity models with another dynamic approach,\nconsisting in the straight modeling of the survival (Az\\'ema supermartingale)\nprocess using the $\\Phi$-martingale.

We further discuss the link between the \"default\" condition and\nchange-of-measure techniques. The expectation of $V^+_t$ conditional upon\n$\\tau=t$ is equal to the unconditional expectation of $V^+_t\\zeta_t$. The\nprocess $\\zeta$ is explicitly derived in the dynamic approaches: it is proven\nto be positive and to have unit expectation.

Such a distorted nonlinear expectation is not\nsub-additive in general, so it is beyond the scope of Peng's framework of\nnonlinear expectations. A more fundamental problem when extending the distorted\nexpectation to a dynamic setting is time-inconsistency, that is, the usual\n\"tower property\" fails. By localizing the probability distortion and\nrestricting to a smaller class of random variables, we introduce a so-called\ndistorted probability and construct a conditional expectation in such a way\nthat it coincides with the original nonlinear expectation at time zero, but has\na time-consistent dynamics in the sense that the tower property remains valid.\nFurthermore, we show that in the continuous time model this conditional\nexpectation corresponds to a parabolic differential equation whose coefficient\ninvolves the law of the underlying diffusion. This work is the first step\ntowards a new understanding of nonlinear expectations under probability\ndistortion, and will potentially be a helpful tool for solving\ntime-inconsistent stochastic optimization problems.\n",

In this paper, we\nintroduce the theory of multiple internally embedded financial time-clocks\nmotivated by behavioral finance. To be consistent with dynamic asset pricing\ntheory and option pricing, as suggested by behavioral finance, the investors'\nview is considered by introducing an intrinsic time process which we refer to\nas a behavioral subordinator. The process is subordinated to the Brownian\nmotion process in the well-known log-normal model, resulting in a new log-price\nprocess. The number of embedded subordinations results in a new parameter that\nmust be estimated and this parameter is as important as the mean and variance\nof asset returns. We describe new distributions, demonstrating how they can be\napplied to modeling the tail behavior of stock market returns. We apply the\nproposed models to modeling S&P 500 returns, treating the CBOE Volatility Index\nas intrinsic time change and the CBOE Volatility-of-Volatility Index as the\nvolatility subordinator. We find that these volatility indexes are not proper\ntime-change subordinators in modeling the returns of the S&P 500.\n",

Uncertainty is modelled\nby a (possibly uncountable) family of price processes on the same probability\nspace. Our technical assumption is the continuity of the price processes with\nrespect to uncertain parameters. In this setting, we introduce a new\ntopological framework which allows us to use the classical arguments in\narbitrage pricing theory involving $L^p$ spaces, the Hahn-Banach separation\ntheorem and other tools from functional analysis. The first result is the\nequivalence of a ``no robust arbitrage\" condition and the existence of a new\n``robust pricing system\". The second result shows superhedging dualities and\nthe existence of superhedging strategies without restrictive conditions on\npayoff functions, unlike other related studies. The third result discusses\ncompleteness in the present robust setting. When other options are available\nfor static trading, we could reduce the set of robust pricing systems and hence\nthe superhedging prices.\n",

Subsequently, as an inverse target -- allocating risk,\nthe risk budgeting problem of how to obtain policies whose risk contributions\ncoincide with pre-given risk budgets in the continuous-time case is also\nexplored in this paper.

The empirical analysis results show that\nthe unobserved instantaneous interest rate shows a mean reverting behaviour in\nthe U.S. term structure. The zero-coupon bonds yields are used as inputs for\nthe estimation process. The results of the analysis are gotten from the monthly\nobservations of U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds from December, 1992 to January,\n1993. The empirical evidence indicates that to model properly the historical\nmortality trends at different ages, both the survival rate and the yield data\nare needed to achieve a satisfactory empirical fit over the zero coupon\nlongevity bond term structure. The dynamics of the resulting model allowed us\nto perform simulation on the survival rates, which enables us to model\nlongevity risk.\n",

In the first problem, we derive a\nstochastic control model to optimize banks' dividend and recapitalization\npolicies and calibrate that to a sample of U.S. banks in the situation where we\nmodel banks' true accounting asset values as partially observed variables due\nto the opaqueness in banks' assets. By the calibrated model, the noise in\nreported accounting asset values hides about one-third of the true asset return\nvolatility and raises the banks' market equity value by 7.8\\% because the noise\nhides the banks' solvency risk from banking regulators. Particularly, those\nbanks with a high level of loan loss provisions, nonperforming assets, and real\nestate loans, and with a low volatility of reported total assets have noisy\naccounting asset values. Because of the substantial shock on the true asset\nvalues, the banks' assets were more opaque during the recent financial crisis.\nIn the second problem, we present an optimal portfolio selection model with\nvoluntary retirement option in an economic situation, where an investor is\nfacing borrowing and short sale constraints, as well as the cointegration\nbetween the stock and labor markets. Our model reinterprets the\nnon-participation puzzle in stock investment and early retirement in market\nbooms. Investor's willingness to retire earlier becomes stronger as risk\naversion increases or as wages decline in the long term. Consistent with the\nempirical evidence, we find that retirement flexibility makes the optimal\nportfolio invest less in the stock market. We also find that our\nmodel-generated portfolio share rises in wealth.\n",

At the same time, two ways of adjusting the estimation\nwindow, rolling and increasing, are also considered. The unbiased test and\ngoodness of fit test are used to evaluate these methods. The empirical result\nshows that the implied volatility is the best estimator of the real volatility.\nThe rolling estimation window is recommended when using the historical\nvolatility. On the contrary, the estimation window is supposed to be increased\nwhen using the GARCH model.\n",

In particular, the axiom of no reward for concentration (NRC) is\narguably quite strong, which imposes an additive form of the risk measure on\nportfolios with a certain dependence structure. We move away from the axiom of\nNRC by introducing the notion of concentration aversion, which does not impose\nany specific form of the risk measure. It turns out that risk measures with\nconcentration aversion are functions of ES and the expectation. Together with\nthe other three standard axioms of monotonicity, translation invariance and\nlower semicontinuity, concentration aversion uniquely characterizes the family\nof ES. In addition, we establish an axiomatic foundation for the problem of\nmean-ES portfolio selection and new explicit formulas for convex and consistent\nrisk measures. Finally, we provide an economic justification for concentration\naversion via a few axioms on the attitude of a regulator towards dependence\nstructures.\n",

        "summary": "  Positive feedback trading, which buys when prices rise and sells when prices\nfall, has long been criticized for being destabilizing as it moves prices away\nfrom the fundamentals. Motivated by the relationship between positive feedback\ntrading and investors cognitive bias, this paper provides a quantitative\nmeasurement of the bias based on the conditional estimates of diffusion\nprocesses. We prove the asymptotic properties of the estimates, which helps to\ninterpret the investment behaviors that if a feedback trader finds a security\nperform better than his expectation, he will expect the future return to be\nhigher, while in the long term, this bias will converge to zero. Furthermore,\nthe observed deviations between the return forecast and its realized value lead\nto adaptive expectations in reality, for which we raise an exponential\nsmoothing model as an adjustment method. In the empirical study on the stock\nmarket in China, we show the effectiveness of the ES method in bringing the\nbiased expectation closer to the fundamental level, and suggest that the\nfeedback traders, who are often over-optimistic about the return, are likely to\nsuffer from downside risk and aggravate the speculative bubbles in the market.\n",

While this field\ncanonically considers a single agent, the situation where multiple agents, or\neven an infinite amount of agents are contracted by a principal are growing in\nprominence and pose interesting and realistic problems. Here, agents form a\nNash equilibrium among themselves, and a Stackelberg equilibrium between\nthemselves as a collective and the principal.\n  We apply this framework to the problem of implementing Renewable Energy\nCertificate (REC) markets, where the principal requires regulated firms (power\ngenerators) to pay a non-compliance penalty which is inversely proportional to\nthe amount of RECs they have. RECs can be obtained by generating electricity\nfrom clean sources or purchasing on the market. The agents react to this\npenalty and optimize their behaviours to navigate the system at minimum cost.\nIn the agents' model we incorporate market clearing as well as agent\nheterogeneity. For a given market design, we find the Nash equilibrium among\nagents using techniques from mean field games. We then use techniques from\nextended McKean-Vlasov control problems to solve the principal (regulators)\nproblem, who aim to choose the penalty function in such a way that balances\nenvironmental and revenue impacts optimally. We find through these techniques\nthat the optimal penalty function is linear in the agents' state, suggesting\nthe optimal emissions regulation market is more akin to a tax or rebate,\nregardless of the principal's utility function.\n",

For general mean-risk models such closed form optimal\nportfolios are difficult to obtain. In this note, we obtain closed form\nexpression for frontier portfolios under mean-risk criteria when risk is\nmodelled by any finite law-invariant convex measures of risk and when return\nvectors follow the class of normal mean-variance mixture (NMVM) distributions.\nTo achieve this goal, we first present necessary as well as sufficient\nconditions for stochastic dominance within the class of one dimensional NMVM\nmodels and then we apply them to portfolio optimization problems. Our main\nresult in this paper states that when return vectors follow the class of NMVM\ndistributions the associated mean-risk frontier portfolios can be obtained by\noptimizing a Markowitz mean-variance model with an appropriately adjusted\nreturn vector.\n",

In\nthis stochastic generalization of Hotelling's rule, the expected shadow price\nof reserves rises at the rate of interest across exploratory episodes. However,\nthe actual trajectories of prices realized prior to exhaustion of the\nexploratory area may jump up or down upon exploration.

We suppose that home prices are set by a\nrepresentative home-buyer, who can afford to pay only a fixed cash-flow per\nunit time for housing. The cash-flow is a fraction of the representative\nhome-buyer's salary, which grows at a rate that is proportional to the\nrisk-free rate of interest. As a result, in the long-run, higher interest rates\nlead to faster growth of home prices. The representative home-buyer finances\nthe purchase of a home by taking out a mortgage. The mortgage rate paid by the\nhome-buyer is fixed at the time of purchase and equal to the risk-free rate of\ninterest plus a positive constant. As the home-buyer can only afford to pay a\nfixed cash-flow per unit time, a higher mortgage rate limits the size of the\nloan the home-buyer can take out. As a result, the short-term effect of higher\ninterest rates is to lower the value of homes. In this setting, we consider an\ninvestor who wishes to buy and then sell a home in order to maximize his\ndiscounted expected profit. This leads to a nested optimal stopping problem. We\nuse a nonnegative concave majorant approach to derive the investor's optimal\nbuying and selling strategies. Additionally, we provide a detailed analytic and\nnumerical study of the case in which the risk-free rate of interest is modeled\nby a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process.

We firstly\npropose how compared to normal densities, our target time series seem to be\nassociated with a higher number of rare events, and Gaussian statistics tend to\nunderestimate these events' frequency drastically. To this end, we suggest that\nby imposing Gaussian densities to the natural processes, one will seriously\nneglect the existence of extreme events in many circumstances. The central\nquestion of our study concerns the consideration of the effects of these rare\nevents in the corresponding probability densities and studying their role from\nthe point of view of quantum measurements. To model the non-Gaussian behavior\nof these time-series, we utilize the multifractal random walk (MRW) approach\nand control the non-Gaussianity parameter $\\lambda$ accordingly. Using the\nframework of quantum mechanics, we then examine the role of $\\lambda$ in\nquantum potentials derived for these time series. Our Bohmian quantum analysis\nshows that the derived potential takes some negative values in high frequencies\n(its mean values), then substantially increases, and the value drops again for\nthe rare events. We thus conclude that these events could generate a potential\nbarrier that the system, lingering in a non-Gaussian high-frequency region,\nencounters, and their role becomes more prominent when it comes to transversing\nthis barrier. In this study, as an example of the application of quantum\npotential outside of the micro-world, we compute the quantum potentials for the\nS\\&P financial market time series to verify the presence of rare events in the\nnon-Gaussian densities for this real data and remark the deviation from the\nGaussian case.\n",

This paper presents the\nresults of employing the intrinsic entropy model as a substitute for estimating\nthe volatility of stock market indices. Diverging from the widely used\nvolatility models that take into account only the elements related to the\ntraded prices, namely the open, high, low, and close prices of a trading day\n(OHLC), the intrinsic entropy model takes into account the traded volumes\nduring the considered time frame as well. We adjust the intraday intrinsic\nentropy model that we introduced earlier for exchange-traded securities in\norder to connect daily OHLC prices with the ratio of the corresponding daily\nvolume to the overall volume traded in the considered period. The intrinsic\nentropy model conceptualizes this ratio as entropic probability or market\ncredence assigned to the corresponding price level. The intrinsic entropy is\ncomputed using historical daily data for traded market indices (S&P 500, Dow\n30, NYSE Composite, NASDAQ Composite, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng Index). We\ncompare the results produced by the intrinsic entropy model with the volatility\nestimates obtained for the same data sets using widely employed industry\nvolatility estimators. The intrinsic entropy model proves to consistently\ndeliver reliable estimates for various time frames while showing peculiarly\nhigh values for the coefficient of variation, with the estimates falling in a\nsignificantly lower interval range compared with those provided by the other\nadvanced volatility estimators.\n",

However, the funded scheme does not\ncompletely replace PAYGO (Pay as You Go) scheme and there exist heterogeneous\nmixes among PAYGO, EET (Exempt, Exempt, Taxed) and individual savings in\ndifferent countries. In this paper, we establish the optimal mix by solving a\nNash equilibrium between the pension participants and the government. Given the\nobligatory PAYGO and EET contribution rates, the participants choose the\noptimal asset allocation of the individual savings and the consumption policies\nto achieve the objective. The results extend the ``Samuelson-Aaron\" criterion\nto age-dependent preference orderings. And we identify three critical ages to\ndistinguish the multiple outcomes of preference orderings based on\nheterogeneous characteristic parameters. The government is fully aware of the\noptimal feedback of the participants. It chooses the optimal PAYGO and EET\ncontribution rates to maximize the overall utility of the participants weighted\nby each cohort's population. As such, the negative population growth rate leads\nto the decline of the PAYGO attractiveness as well as the increase of the older\ncohorts' weight in the government decision-making. The optimal mix is the\ncomprehensive result of the two effects.\n",

A Stackelberg model is\nestablished to analyze the non-cooperative relationship between the insurer and\nreinsurers, where the insurer is considered as the follower and the reinsurers\nare considered as the leaders. The insurer is a price taker who determines\nreinsurance demand in the reinsurance market, while the reinsurers can price\nthe reinsurance treaties. Our contribution is to use a Nash game to describe\nthe price-competition between two reinsurers. We assume that one of the\nreinsurers adopts the variance premium principle and the other adopts the\nexpected value premium principle. The insurer and the reinsurers aim to\nmaximize their respective mean-variance cost functions which lead to a\ntime-inconsistency control problem. To overcome the time-inconsistency issue in\nthe game, we formulate the optimization problem of each player as an embedded\ngame and solve it via a corresponding extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nequation. We find that the insurer will sign propositional and excess loss\nreinsurance strategies with reinsurer 1 and reinsurer 2, respectively. When the\nclaim size follows exponential distribution, there exists a unique equilibrium\nreinsurance premium strategy. Our numerical analysis verifies the impact of\nclaim size, risk aversion and interest rates of the insurer and reinsurers on\nequilibrium reinsurance strategy and premium strategy, which can help to\nunderstand competition in the reinsurance market\n",

Classical financial\nmodels often do not adequately reflect the phenomena of bubbles, crises, and\ntransitions between them during credit cycles.

In\nthis paper, a relatively simple mathematical formalism is applied to provide a\nunified framework for modeling credit cycles and systemic risk assessment. The\nproposed model is analyzed in detail to assess whether it can reflect very\ndifferent states of the economy. Basing on those results, measures of systemic\nrisk are constructed to provide information regarding the stability of the\nsystem. The formalism is then applied to describe the full credit cycle with\nthe explanation of causal relationships between the phases expressed in terms\nof parameters derived from real-world quantities. The framework can be\nnaturally interpreted and understood with respect to different economic\nsituations and easily incorporated into the analysis and decision-making\nprocess based on classical models, significantly enhancing their quality and\nflexibility.\n",

After that, the theoretical foundation is established in terms of a\nnovel definition of the viscosity solution incorporating our asymptotic\nterminal condition.

        "summary": "  Least Squares regression was first introduced for the pricing of\nAmerican-style options, but it has since been expanded to include swing options\npricing. The swing options price may be viewed as a solution to a Backward\nDynamic Programming Principle, which involves a conditional expectation known\nas the continuation value. The approximation of the continuation value using\nleast squares regression involves two levels of approximation. First, the\ncontinuation value is replaced by an orthogonal projection over a subspace\nspanned by a finite set of $m$ squared-integrable functions (regression\nfunctions) yielding a first approximation $V^m$ of the swing value function. In\nthis paper, we prove that, with well-chosen regression functions, $V^m$\nconverges to the swing actual price $V$ as $m \\to + \\infty$. A similar result\nis proved when the regression functions are replaced by neural networks. For\nboth methods (least squares or neural networks), we analyze the second level of\napproximation involving practical computation of the swing price using Monte\nCarlo simulations and yielding an approximation $V^{m, N}$ (where $N$ denotes\nthe Monte Carlo sample size). Especially, we prove that $V^{m, N} \\to V^m$ as\n$N \\to + \\infty$ for both methods and using Hilbert basis in the least squares\nregression. Besides, a convergence rate of order\n$\\mathcal{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\big)$ is proved in the least squares case.\nSeveral convergence results in this paper are based on the continuity of the\nswing value function with respect to cumulative consumption, which is also\nproved in the paper and has not been yet explored in the literature before for\nthe best of our knowledge.\n",

When controls are one-dimensional, jump costs are most naturally\ncomputed by linear interpolation. When the controls are multi-dimensional the\nsituation is more complex, especially when the model parameters depend on an\nadditional mean-field interaction term, in which case one needs to \"jointly\"\nand \"consistently\" interpolate jumps both on a distributional and a pathwise\nlevel. This is achieved by introducing the novel concept of two-layer\nparametrisations of stochastic processes. Two-layer parametrisations allow us\nto equivalently rewrite rewards in terms of continuous functions of\nparametrisations of the control process and to derive an explicit\nrepresentation of rewards in terms of minimal jump costs. From this we derive a\nDPP for extended mean-field control problems with multi-dimensional singular\ncontrols. Under the additional assumption that the value function is continuous\nwe characterise the value function as the minimal super-solution to a certain\nquasi-variational inequality in the Wasserstein space.\n",

The results are then applied to two distinct commodities -- corn and\nsoybean -- enabling a comprehensive comparison of the VaR values in the\npresence and absence of jumps.\n",

This perspective likens returns to microscopic particle\nmotion, governed by quantum probabilities akin to physical laws. However, such\napproaches presuppose specific microscopic quantum effects in return changes, a\npremise criticized for lack of guarantee. This paper diverges by asserting that\nquantum probability is a mathematical extension of classical probability to\ncomplex numbers. It isn't exclusively tied to microscopic quantum phenomena,\nbypassing the need for quantum effects in returns.By directly linking quantum\nprobability's mathematical structure to traders' decisions and market\nbehaviors, it avoids assuming quantum effects for returns and invoking the wave\nfunction. The complex phase of quantum probability, capturing transitions\nbetween long and short decisions while considering information interaction\namong traders, offers an inherent advantage over classical probability in\ncharacterizing the multimodal distribution of asset returns.Utilizing Fourier\ndecomposition, we derive a Schr\\\"odinger-like trading equation, where each term\nexplicitly corresponds to implications of market trading. The equation\nindicates discrete energy levels in financial trading, with returns following a\nnormal distribution at the lowest level. As the market transitions to higher\ntrading levels, a phase shift occurs in the return distribution, leading to\nmultimodality and fat tails. Empirical research on the Chinese stock market\nsupports the existence of energy levels and multimodal distributions derived\nfrom this quantum probability asset returns model.\n",

The Riccati\ntontine is yet another way of pooling and sharing longevity risk, but is\ndifferent from competing designs in two key ways. The first is that in the\nRiccati tontine, the representative investor is expected -- although not\nguaranteed -- to receive their money back if they die, or when the tontine\nlapses. The second is that the underlying funds within the tontine are\ndeliberately {\\em not} indexed to the stock market. Instead, the risky assets\nor underlying investments are selected so that return shocks are negatively\ncorrelated with stochastic mortality, which will maximize the expected payout\nto survivors. This means that during a pandemic, for example, the Riccati\ntontine fund's performance will be impaired relative to the market index, but\nwill not be expected to lose money for participants. In addition to describing\nand explaining the rationale for this non-traditional asset allocation, the\npaper provides a mathematical proof that the recovery schedule that generates\nthis financial outcome satisfies a first-order ODE that is quadratic in the\nunknown function, which (yes) is known as a Riccati equation.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper analyzes a problem of optimal static hedging using derivatives in\nincomplete markets. The investor is assumed to have a risk exposure to two\nunderlying assets. The hedging instruments are vanilla options written on a\nsingle underlying asset. The hedging problem is formulated as a utility\nmaximization problem whereby the form of the optimal static hedge is\ndetermined. Among our results, a semi-analytical solution for the optimizer is\nfound through variational methods for exponential, power/logarithmic, and\nquadratic utility. When vanilla options are available for each underlying\nasset, the optimal solution is related to the fixed points of a Lipschitz map.\nIn the case of exponential utility, there is only one such fixed point, and\nsubsequent iterations of the map converge to it.\n",

Hypothetically, suppose that market\nforces determine daily volatility such that a daily leveraged S&P 500 fund\ncannot outperform a standard S&P 500 fund in the long run. Then this\nhypothetical volatility happens to support the increase in volatility seen in\nthe S&P 500 index. On this basis, it appears that the classic argument of the\nmarket portfolio being unbeatable in the long run is determining the volatility\nof S&P 500 daily returns. Moreover, it follows that the long-term volatility of\nthe daily returns for the S&P 500 Index should continue to increase until\npassing a particular threshold. If, on the other hand, this hypothesis about\nmarket forces increasing volatility is invalid, then there is room for daily\nleveraged S&P 500 funds to outperform their unleveraged counterparts in the\nlong run.\n",

We assume that the\nstock can go bankrupt, i.e., lose all of its value, at some exogenous random\ntime (independent of the stock price) modeled as the first arrival time of a\nhomogeneous Poisson process. For this setup, we study Merton's optimal\nportfolio problem consisting in maximizing the expected isoelastic utility of\nthe total wealth at a given finite maturity time. We obtain an analytical\nsolution using coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The optimal\nstrategy bans borrowing and never allocates more wealth into the stock than the\nclassical Merton ratio recommends. For non-logarithmic isoelastic utilities,\nthe optimal weights are non-myopic. This is an example where a realistic\nproblem, being merely a slight modification of the usual GBM model, leads to\nnon-myopic weights. For logarithmic utility, we additionally present an\nalternative derivation using a stochastic integral and verify that the weights\nobtained are identical to our first approach.

It employs the growth optimal portfolio of the stocks as\nnumeraire and the new benchmark-neutral pricing measure for pricing. For a\nrealistic parsimonious model, this pricing measure turns out to be an\nequivalent probability measure, which is not the case for the risk-neutral\npricing measure. Many risk-neutral prices of long-term contracts are more\nexpensive than necessary. Benchmark-neutral pricing identifies the minimal\npossible prices of contingent claims, which is illustrated with remarkable\naccuracy for a long-term zero-coupon bond.\n",

Under this regulation, firms\nhave the flexibility to respond by implementing pollution abatement, reducing\noutput, and participating in emission trading, while a regulator dynamically\nallocates emission allowances to each firm. The resulting mean-field game is of\nlinear quadratic type and equivalent to a mean-field type control problem,\ni.e., it is a potential game. We find explicit solutions to this problem\nthrough the solutions to differential equations of Riccati type. Further, we\ninvestigate the carbon emission equilibrium price that satisfies the market\nclearing condition and find a specific form of FBSDE of McKean-Vlasov type with\ncommon noise.

We thus can break the pricing problem of margin-call stock loans into\ntwo steps: 1) finding the optimal exit prices by solving numerically the\ngoverning Volterra integral equation and 2) calculating the values of\nmargin-call stock loans based on the obtained optimal exit prices. By\nvalidating and comparing with other available numerical methods, we show that\nour proposed numerical scheme offers a reliable and efficient way to calculate\nthe service fee of a margin-call stock loan contract, track the contract value\nover time, and compute the level of stock price above which it is optimal to\nexit the contract.

The RN measure, fundamental in derivative pricing, is contrasted with\nthe RW measure, which incorporates risk premiums and better reflects actual\nmarket behavior and investor preferences, making it crucial for risk\nmanagement. We address the challenges of incorporating real-world dynamics into\nfinancial models, such as accounting for market premiums, producing realistic\nterm structures of market indicators, and fitting any arbitrarily given market\ncurve. Our framework is designed to be general, applicable to a variety of\ndiffusion models, including those with non-additive noise such as the CIR++\nmodel. Through case studies involving Goldman Sachs' 2024 global credit outlook\nforecasts and the European Banking Authority (EBA) 2023 stress tests, we\nvalidate the robustness, practical relevance and applicability of our\nmethodology. This work contributes to the literature by providing a versatile\ntool for better risk measures and enhancing the realism of financial models\nunder the RW measure. Our model's versatility extends to stress testing and\nscenario analysis, providing practitioners with a powerful tool to evaluate\nvarious what-if scenarios and make well-informed decisions, particularly in\npricing and risk management strategies.\n",

This can occur for instance due to the averaging process when\ncomputing Expected Shortfall. The current literature proposes a solution, the\nso-called adjusted Expected Shortfall. This risk measure is the supremum of\nExpected Shortfalls for all possible levels, adjusted with a function $g$, the\nso-called target risk profile. We generalize this idea by using other risk\nmeasures instead of Expected Shortfall. Therefore, we introduce the concept of\ngeneral adjusted risk measures. For these the realization of the adjusted risk\nmeasure quantifies the minimal amount of capital that has to be raised and\ninjected in a financial position $X$ to ensure that the risk measure is always\nsmaller or equal to the adjustment function $g(p)$ for all levels $p\\in[0,1]$.\nWe discuss a variety of assumptions such that desirable properties for risk\nmeasures are satisfied in this setup. From a theoretical point of view, our\nmain contribution is the analysis of equivalent assumptions such that a general\nadjusted risk measure is positive homogeneous and subadditive. Furthermore, we\nshow that these conditions hold for a bunch of new risk measures, beyond the\nadjusted Expected Shortfall. For these risk measures, we derive their dual\nrepresentations.

Our methodology hinges\non formulating and solving a complex system of interconnected partial\ndifferential equations derived from the Feynman-Kac formula for switching\ndiffusions. To illustrate the practical relevance of our approach, Monte Carlo\nsimulations for process with Markovian switching are applied to validate the\naccuracy and computational efficiency of the analytical formulas. Furthermore,\nwe apply our findings for the valuation of financial derivatives within a\ndynamic nonlinear mean-reverting regime-switching framework, which demonstrates\nsignificant improvements over traditional methods.

To mitigate these risks,\nAAIs can purchase proportional reinsurance. Besides, AAIs allocate their wealth\nin a financial market consisting of cash, and a stock characterized by the 4/2\nstochastic volatility model. AAIs compete with each other based on relative\nperformance with the mean-variance criterion under the worst-case scenario.\nThis paper formulates a robust time-consistent mean-field game in a non-linear\nsystem.

Finally,\nwe establish a policy improvement theorem and devise an implementable\nreinforcement learning algorithm by casting the optimal problem in a martingale\nframework. Our numerical examples show that exploration leads to an optimal\nwealth process that is more dispersedly distributed with heavier tail compared\nto that of the case without exploration. This effect becomes less significant\nas the exploration parameter is smaller.

The model generalizes the Hawkes process by substituting the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck intensity with a CARMA(p,q) model where the associated state\nprocess is driven by the counting process itself. The proposed model preserves\nthe same degree of tractability as the Hawkes process, but it can reproduce\nmore complex time-dependent structures observed in several market data. The\npaper presents a new model of asset price dynamics based on the CARMA(p,q)\nHawkes model. It is constructed using a compound version of it with a random\njump size that is independent of both the counting and the intensity processes\nand can be employed as the main block for pure jump and (stochastic volatility)\njump-diffusion processes. The numerical results for pricing European options\nillustrate that the new model can replicate the volatility smile observed in\nfinancial markets.

All shocks are assumed to be linked by a dependence\nrelationship, that in this paper is assumed to be exchangeable and Archimedean.\nThis approach is able to encompass both systemic risk and contagion, with the\nMarshall-Olkin pure systemic risk model and the Archimedean contagion model as\nextreme cases. Moreover, we show that assuming an affine structure for the\nintensities of idiosyncratic and systemic shocks and a Gumbel copula, the\napproach delivers a complete multivariate distribution with exponential\nmarginal distributions. The model can be estimated by applying a moment\nmatching procedure to the bivariate marginals. We also provide an easy visual\ncheck of the good specification of the model.

The case of a pure-jump stable-like L\\'evy model\nis also considered under the minimal possible conditions for the resulting\nexpansion to be well defined.

Simulation results indicate that our\nasymptotic expansions give good fits for options with maturities up to one\nmonth, underpinning their relevance in practical applications, and an analysis\nof the implied volatility skew in recent S&P500 options data shows it to be\nconsistent with the infinite variation jump component of our models.\n",

The method consists in moving the parameters through change of\nmeasure, which we call a weak perturbation, decoupling the usual wealth\nequation from the varying parameters. By rewriting the maximization problem in\nterms of a convex-analytical support function of a weakly-compact set,\ncrucially leveraging on the work of Backhoff and Fontbona (SIFIN 2016), the\nprevious formulation let us prove the Hadamard directional differentiability of\nthe value function w.r.t. the drift and interest rate parameters, as well as\nfor volatility matrices under a stability condition on their Kernel, and derive\nexplicit expressions for the directional derivatives. We contrast our proposed\nweak perturbations against what we call strong perturbations, where the wealth\nequation is directly influenced by the changing parameters. Contrary to\nconventional wisdom, we find that both points of view generally yield different\nsensitivities unless e.g. if initial parameters and their perturbations are\ndeterministic.\n",

In this paper, we show, for a class of price processes which are\nnot necessarily semimartingales, the existence of an optimal trading strategy\nfor utility maximisation under transaction costs by establishing the existence\nof a so-called shadow price. This is a semimartingale price process, taking\nvalues in the bid ask spread, such that frictionless trading for that price\nprocess leads to the same optimal strategy and utility as the original problem\nunder transaction costs. Our results combine arguments from convex duality with\nthe stickiness condition introduced by P. Guasoni. They apply in particular to\nexponential utility and geometric fractional Brownian motion. In this case, the\nshadow price is an Ito process. As a consequence we obtain a rather surprising\nresult on the pathwise behaviour of fractional Brownian motion: the\ntrajectories may touch an Ito process in a one-sided manner without reflection.\n",

By using the expansion of filtration, the random time uncertainty\nand its entailed risk are fully considered without any mathematical\nrestriction. In this context with no model's specification for the random time,\nthe main challenge lies in finding the dynamics and the structures for the\nvalue processes of defaultable or mortality and/or longevity securities which\nare vital for the insurance securitization.

It shows how the FI\noptimizes its trading to account for market illiquidity using an extension of\nthe Almgren-Chriss market impact model of multiple risky assets. This expected\nutility optimization problem over the set of adapted strategies turns out to\nhave the same solutions as a mean-variance optimization over deterministic\ntrading strategies. That means the optimal adapted trading strategy is both\ndeterministic and time-consistent. It is also found to have an explicit closed\nform that clearly displays interesting properties. For example, the classic\nconstant Merton portfolio strategy, a particular solution of the frictionless\nlimit of the problem, behaves like an attractor in the space of more general\nsolutions. The main effect of temporary market impact is to slow down the speed\nof convergence to this constant Merton portfolio. The effect of permanent\nmarket impact is to incentivize the FI to buy additional risky assets near the\nend of the period. This property, that we name the Ponzi property, is related\nto the creation and bursting of bubbles in the market.

Catastrophe (CAT) bonds have emerged as a method to offset\nthis risk and a corresponding literature has developed that attempts to provide\na market-consistent pricing methodology for these and other long-dated,\ninsurance-type contracts. This paper aims to unify and generalize several of\nthe widely-used pricing approaches for long-dated contracts with a focus on\nstylized CAT bonds and market-consistent valuation. It proposes a loading\npricing concept that combines the theoretically possible minimal price of a\ncontract with its formally obtained risk neutral price, without creating\neconomically meaningful arbitrage. A loading degree controls how much influence\nthe formally obtained risk neutral price has on the market price. A key finding\nis that this loading degree has to be constant for a minimally fluctuating\ncontract, and is an important, measurable characteristic for prices of\nlong-dated contracts. Loading pricing allows long-dated, insurance-type\ncontracts to be priced less expensively and with higher return on investment\nthan under classical pricing approaches. Loading pricing enables insurance\ncompanies to accumulate systematically reserves needed to manage its risk of\nruin in a market consistent manner.\n",

Several features of\nour model are amenable to an exact analytical treatment. We find in particular\nthat the impact is a concave function of the transacted volume (aka the\n\"square-root impact law\"), as in the normal diffusion limit. However, the\nimpact kernel decays as $t^{-\\beta}$ with $\\beta=1/2$ in the diffusive case,\nwhich is inconsistent with market efficiency. In the sub-diffusive case the\ndecay exponent $\\beta$ takes any value in $[0,1/2]$, and can be tuned to match\nthe empirical value $\\beta \\approx 1/4$. Numerical simulations confirm our\ntheoretical results. Several extensions of the model are suggested.\n",

As a result, the clearing vector may\nsuffer from estimation errors in the liabilities matrix. We quantify the\nclearing vector's sensitivity to such estimation errors and show that its\ndirectional derivatives are, like the clearing vector itself, solutions of\nfixed point equations. We describe estimation errors utilizing a basis for the\nspace of matrices representing permissible perturbations and derive analytical\nsolutions to the maximal deviations of the Eisenberg-Noe clearing vector.

The seller of a futures contract commits to deliver, say,\npower, over a certain period, while the classical forward is a financial\nagreement settled on a maturity date. Our purpose is to design a\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton framework for an additive, mean-reverting, multicommodity\nmarket consisting of forward contracts of any delivery period. The main\nassumption is that forward prices can be represented as affine functions of a\nuniversal source of randomness. This allows us to completely characterize the\nmodels which prevent arbitrage opportunities: this boils down to finding a\ndensity between a risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, such that the prices of\ntraded assets like forward contracts are true $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingales, and the\nreal world probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$, under which forward prices are\nmean-reverting. The Girsanov kernel for such a transformation turns out to be\nstochastic and unbounded in the diffusion part, while in the jump part the\nGirsanov kernel must be deterministic and bounded: thus, in this respect, we\nprove two results on the martingale property of stochastic exponentials. The\nfirst allows to validate measure changes made of two components: an\nEsscher-type density and a Girsanov transform with stochastic and unbounded\nkernel. The second uses a different approach and works for the case of\ncontinuous density.

Out-of-sample hedge simulations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of real world valuation.\n  In contrast to risk neutral valuation, which is a form of relative valuation,\nthe long term average excess return of the equity market comes into play.\nInstead of the savings account, the num\\'eraire portfolio is employed as the\nfundamental unit of value in the analysis. The num\\'eraire portfolio is the\nstrictly positive, tradable portfolio that when used as benchmark makes all\nbenchmarked nonnegative portfolios supermartingales. The benchmarked real world\nvalue of a benchmarked contingent claim equals its real world conditional\nexpectation. This yields the minimal possible value for its hedgeable part and\nminimizes the fluctuations for its benchmarked hedge error. Under classical\nassumptions, actuarial and risk neutral valuation emerge as special cases of\nthe proposed real world valuation. In long term liability and asset valuation,\nthe proposed real world valuation can lead to significantly lower values than\nsuggested by classical approaches when an equivalent risk neutral probability\nmeasure does not exist.\n",

The available data may be\ninsufficient to determine this distribution precisely, however, and the\nquestion arises: What are the bounds for the option price at a specified\nstrike, given the market-implied constraints?\n  Positivity of the price map imposed by the principle of no-arbitrage is here\nutilised, via the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, to transform the problem\ninto the domain of operator algebras. Optimisation in this larger context is\nessentially geometric, and the outcome is simultaneously super-optimal for all\ncommutative subalgebras.\n  This generates an upper bound for the price of a basket option. With\ninnovative decomposition of the assets in the basket, the result is used to\ncreate converging families of price bounds for vanilla options, interpolate the\nvolatility smile, price options on cross FX rates, and analyse the\nrelationships between swaption and caplet prices.\n",

Our goal is\nto analyze how price impact affects optimal policies, as well as both pricing\nrules and demand schedules for contingent claims. For exponential market makers\npreferences, we establish two effects due to price impact: constrained trading,\nand non-linear hedging costs. To the former, wealth processes in the impact\nmodel are identified with those in a model without impact, but with constrained\ntrading, where the (random) constraint set is generically neither closed nor\nconvex. Regarding hedging, non-linear hedging costs motivate the study of\narbitrage free prices for the claim. We provide three such notions, which\ncoincide in the frictionless case, but which dramatically differ in the\npresence of price impact. Additionally, we show arbitrage opportunities, should\nthey arise from claim prices, can be exploited only for limited position sizes,\nand may be ignored if outweighed by hedging considerations. We also show that\narbitrage inducing prices may arise endogenously in equilibrium, and that\nequilibrium positions are inversely proportional to the market makers'\nrepresentative risk aversion. Therefore, large positions endogenously arise in\nthe limit of either market maker risk neutrality, or a large number of market\nmakers.\n",

In a setting\nwith unhedgeable mortality risk and complete financial market, the optimal\nsolution is given explicitly for contracts with mortality risk using a\nmartingale approach for constrained non-concave optimization problems. We show\nthat regulatory VaR constraints for participating insurance contracts lead to\nmore prudent investment than in the case of no regulation. This result is\ncontrary to the situation where the insurer maximizes the utility of the total\nwealth of the company (without distinguishing between contributions of equity\nholders and policyholders), in which case a VaR constraint may induce the\ninsurer to take excessive risks leading to higher losses than in the case of no\nregulation. Compared to the unregulated problem, the VaR-constrained strategy\nleads to a higher expected utility for the policyholders, highlighting the\npotential usefulness of a VaR-regulation in the context of insurance. The\nprudent investment behavior is more significant if a VaR-type regulation is\nreplaced by a portfolio insurance (PI)-type regulation. Furthermore, a stricter\nregulation (a smaller allowed default probability in the VaR problem or a\nhigher minimum guarantee level in the PI problem) enhances the benefit of the\npolicyholder but deteriorates that of the insurer. For both types of\nregulation, the gains in terms of expected utility are greater for higher\nparticipation rates, while being smaller for higher bonus rates.

We study the filter asymptotics for increasing arrival intensity\nof expert opinions and prove that the conditional mean is a consistent drift\nestimator, it converges in the mean-square sense to the hidden drift.

First, we revisit some existing results on the\nmagnitude of drawdowns for spectrally negative L\\'{e}vy processes using an\napproximation approach. For any spectrally negative L\\'{e}vy process whose\nscale functions are well-behaved at $0+$, we then study the asymptotics of\ndrawdown quantities when the threshold of drawdown magnitude approaches zero.\nWe also show that such asymptotics is robust to perturbations of additional\npositive compound Poisson jumps. Finally, thanks to the asymptotic results and\nsome recent works on the running maximum of L\\'{e}vy processes, we derive the\nlaw of duration of drawdowns for a large class of L\\'{e}vy processes (with a\ngeneral spectrally negative part plus a positive compound Poisson structure).\nThe duration of drawdowns is also known as the \"Time to Recover\" (TTR) the\nhistorical maximum, which is a widely used performance measure in the fund\nmanagement industry. We find that the law of duration of drawdowns\nqualitatively depends on the path type of the spectrally negative component of\nthe underlying L\\'{e}vy process.\n",

One of the ways to model illiquidity\namong others is to build an optimization problem and assume that one of the\nassets in a portfolio can not be sold until a certain finite, infinite or\nrandom moment of time. This approach arises a certain amount of models that are\nactively studied at the moment.\n  Working in the Merton's optimal consumption framework with continuous time we\nconsider an optimization problem for a portfolio with an illiquid, a risky and\na risk-free asset. Our goal in this paper is to carry out a complete Lie group\nanalysis of PDEs describing value function and investment and consumption\nstrategies for a portfolio with an illiquid asset that is sold in an exogenous\nrandom moment of time with a prescribed liquidation time distribution. The\nproblem of such type leads to three dimensional nonlinear\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Such equations are not only tedious\nfor analytical methods but are also quite challenging form a numeric point of\nview. To reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one or even\nto an ODE one usually uses some substitutions, yet the methods used to find\nsuch substitutions are rarely discussed by the authors.\n  We find the admitted Lie algebra for a broad class of liquidation time\ndistributions in cases of HARA and log utility functions and formulate\ncorresponding theorems for all these cases. We use found Lie algebras to obtain\nreductions of the studied equations. Several of similar substitutions were used\nin other papers before whereas others are new to our knowledge. This method\ngives us the possibility to provide a complete set of non-equivalent\nsubstitutions and reduced equations.\n",

Motivated by the fact that this issue is of paramount\nconcern to conservative investors, we dispense with the classical variance as\nthe risk metric and work with drawdown and mean return as the risk-reward pair.\nIn this setting, the main results in this paper address the so-called\n\"efficiency\" of linear time-invariant (LTI) investment feedback strategies\nwhich correspond to Markowitz-style schemes in the finance literature. Our\nanalysis begins with the following principle which is widely used in finance:\nGiven two investment opportunities, if one of them has higher risk and lower\nreturn, it will be deemed to be inefficient or strictly dominated and generally\nrejected in the marketplace. In this framework, with risk-reward pair as\ndescribed above, our main result is that classical Markowitz-style strategies\nare inefficient. To establish this, we use a new investment strategy which\ninvolves a time-varying linear feedback block K(k), called the drawdown\nmodulator. Using this instead of the original LTI feedback block K in the\nMarkowitz scheme, the desired domination is obtained. As a bonus, it is also\nseen that the modulator assures a worst-case level of drawdown protection with\nprobability one.\n",

This inclusion of ambiguity attitude, via an $\\alpha$-maxmin\nnonlinear expectation, renders the stopping problem time-inconsistent. We look\nfor subgame perfect equilibrium stopping policies, formulated as fixed points\nof an operator. For a one-dimensional diffusion with drift and volatility\nuncertainty, we show that every equilibrium can be obtained through a\nfixed-point iteration. This allows us to capture much more diverse behavior,\ndepending on an agent's ambiguity attitude, beyond the standard worst-case (or\nbest-case) analysis. In a concrete example of real options valuation under\nvolatility uncertainty, all equilibrium stopping policies, as well as the best\none among them, are fully characterized. It demonstrates explicitly the effect\nof ambiguity attitude on decision making: the more ambiguity-averse, the more\neager to stop -- so as to withdraw from the uncertain environment. The main\nresult hinges on a delicate analysis of continuous sample paths in the\ncanonical space and the capacity theory.

The flexibility and tractability of the models make\nthem useful in valuing mortality-related products such as death benefits,\nannuities, longevity bonds, and many others, as well as offering optimal\nmean-variance mortality hedging rules. Numerical studies are conducted to\nexamine the effect of incorporating LRD into mortality rates on various\ninsurance products and hedging efficiency.\n",

The \"universality\"\npertains to the fact that this result is model-free, i.e., not dependent on an\nunderlying stochastic process. We extend Cover's theorem to the setting of\nstochastic portfolio theory as initiated by R. Fernholz: the rebalancing rule\nneed not to be constant anymore but may depend on the present state of the\nstock market. This model-free result is complemented by a comparison with the\nlog-optimal numeraire portfolio when fixing a stochastic model of the stock\nmarket. Roughly speaking, under appropriate assumptions, the optimal long run\nyield coincides for the three approaches mentioned in the title of this paper.\nWe present our results in discrete and continuous time.\n",

This is an extension of\nthe optimal Duesenberry's ratcheting consumption problem, studied by Dybvig\n(1995) [Review of Economic Studies 62(2), 287-313], in which consumption is\nassumed to be nondecreasing. Our problem differs from Dybvig's also in that the\ntime of ruin could be finite in our setting, whereas ruin was impossible in\nDybvig's work. We formulate our problem as a stochastic control problem with\nthe objective of maximizing the expected discounted utility of the dividend\nstream until bankruptcy, in which risk preferences are embodied by power\nutility. We semi-explicitly solve the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nvariational inequality, which is a nonlinear free-boundary problem. The optimal\n(excess) dividend rate $c^*_t$ - as a function of the company's current surplus\n$X_t$ and its historical running maximum of the (excess) dividend rate $z_t$ -\nis as follows: There are constants $0 < w_{\\alpha} < w_0 < w^*$ such that (1)\nfor $0 < X_t \\le w_{\\alpha} z_t$, it is optimal to pay dividends at the lowest\nrate $\\alpha z_t$, (2) for $w_{\\alpha} z_t < X_t < w_0 z_t$, it is optimal to\ndistribute dividends at an intermediate rate $c^*_t \\in (\\alpha z_t, z_t)$, (3)\nfor $w_0 z_t < X_t < w^* z_t$, it is optimal to distribute dividends at the\nhistorical peak rate $z_t$, (4) for $X_t > w^* z_t$, it is optimal to increase\nthe dividend rate above $z_t$, and (5) it is optimal to increase $z_t$ via\nsingular control as needed to keep $X_t \\le w^* z_t$. Because, the maximum\n(excess) dividend rate will eventually be proportional to the running maximum\nof the surplus, \"mountains will have to move\" before we increase the dividend\nrate beyond its historical maximum.\n",

Hence, the need for an effective weather risk management tool\n(i.e., weather derivatives) that can hedge crop yields against weather\nuncertainties. However, most smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders\nare unwilling to pay for the price of weather derivatives (WD) because of the\npresence of basis risks (product-design and geographical) in the pricing\nmodels. To eliminate product-design basis risks, a machine learning ensemble\ntechnique was used to determine the relationship between maize yield and\nweather variables. The results revealed that the most significant weather\nvariable that affected the yield of maize was average temperature. A\nmean-reverting model with a time-varying speed of mean reversion, seasonal\nmean, and local volatility that depended on the local average temperature was\nthen proposed. The model was extended to a multi-dimensional model for\ndifferent but correlated locations. Based on these average temperature models,\npricing models for futures, options on futures, and basket futures for\ncumulative average temperature and growing degree-days are presented. Pricing\nfutures on baskets reduces geographical basis risk, as buyers have the\nopportunity to select the most appropriate weather stations with their desired\nweight preference. With these pricing models, farmers and agricultural\nstakeholders can hedge their crops against the perils of extreme weather.\n",

In the\nabsence of dividend payments, our risk process follows a spectrally negative\nL\\'evy process. We assume that the exchange rate is described by a an\nexponentially L\\'evy process, possibly containing the same risk sources like\nthe surplus of the insurance company under consideration. The control mechanism\nchooses the amount of dividend payments. The objective is to maximise the\nexpected dividend payments received until the time of ruin and a penalty\npayment at the time of ruin, which is an increasing function of the size of the\nshortfall at ruin. A complete solution is presented to the corresponding\nstochastic control problem. Via the corresponding Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman\nequation we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of a\nsingle dividend barrier strategy. A number of numerical examples illustrate the\ntheoretical analysis.\n",

However, insurance\ncontracts are not for trade except sometimes as surrender to the selling\noffice. This excludes the situation of arbitrage by buying and selling\ninsurance contracts at different prices. Furthermore, the insurer uses private\ninformation on top of the publicly available one about financial market. This\npaper provides a study of the consistency of insurance contracts in connection\nwith trades in the financial market with explicit mention of the information\ninvolved.\n  By defining strategies on an insurance portfolio and combining them with\nfinancial trading strategies, we arrive at the notion of insurance-finance\narbitrage (IFA). In analogy to the classical fundamental theorem of asset\npricing, we give a fundamental theorem on the absence of IFA, leading to the\nexistence of an insurance-finance-consistent probability. In addition, we study\nwhen this probability gives the expected discounted cash-flows required by the\nEIOPA best estimate.\n  The generality of our approach allows to incorporate many important aspects,\nlike mortality risk or general levels of dependence between mortality and stock\nmarkets. Utilizing the theory of enlargements of filtrations, we construct a\ntractable framework for insurance-finance consistent valuation.\n",

In (A) we follow the approach taken in the Entropy Optimal Transport (EOT)\nprimal problem by Liero et al. \"Optimal entropy-transport problems and a new\nHellinger-Kantorovic distance between positive measures\", Invent. math. 2018,\nbut we add the constraint, typical of Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT)\ntheory, that the infimum of the cost functional is taken over martingale\nprobability measures, instead of finite positive measures, as in Liero et al..\nThe Problem (A) differs from the corresponding problem in Liero et al. not only\nby the martingale constraint, but also because we admit less restrictive\npenalization terms $\\mathcal{D}_{U}$, which may not have a divergence\nformulation. In Problem (B) the objective functional, associated via Fenchel\nconjugacy to the terms $\\mathcal{D}_{U}$, is not any more linear, as in OT or\nin MOT. This leads to a novel optimization problem which also has a clear\nfinancial interpretation as a nonlinear subhedging value. Our theory allows us\nto establish a nonlinear robust pricing-hedging duality, which covers a wide\nrange of known robust results. We also focus on Wasserstein-induced\npenalizations and we study how the duality is affected by variations in the\npenalty terms, with a special focus on the convergence of EMOT to the extreme\ncase of MOT.\n",

Specifically, it is either the\ncase that the probability distortions are degenerate in the sense that the\ninvestor would never invest in the risky assets, or the marginal probability\ndistortion equals to a normalized power of the quantile function of the pricing\nkernel. We also characterize the optimal wealth process, whose structure\nmotivates the introduction of a new, distorted measure and a related market. We\nthen build a striking correspondence between the forward rank-dependent\ncriteria in the original market and forward criteria without probability\ndistortions in the auxiliary market. This connection also provides a direct\nconstruction method for forward rank-dependent criteria. A byproduct of our\nwork are some new results on the so-called dynamic utilities and on\ntime-inconsistent problems in the classical (backward) setting.\n",

This can for example model\na situation where the asset price is partially controlled by a company which\nintervenes when the price is reaching a certain lower barrier. See e.g. Jarrow\n& Protter for an explanation and discussion of this model in the Brownian\nmotion case. As already pointed out by Karatzas & Shreve (in the continuous\nsetting), this allows for arbitrages in the market. However, the situation in\nthe case of jumps is not clear. Moreover, it is not clear what happens if there\nis a delay in the system.\n  In this paper we consider a jump diffusion market model with a singular drift\nterm modelled as the local time of a given process, and with a delay \\theta>0\nin the information flow available for the trader. We allow the stock price\ndynamics to depend on both a continuous process (Brownian motion) and a jump\nprocess (Poisson random measure). We believe that jumps and delays are\nessential in order to get more realistic financial market models.\n  Using white noise calculus we compute explicitly the optimal consumption rate\nand portfolio in this case and we show that the maximal value is finite as long\nas the delay \\theta> 0. This implies that there is no arbitrage in the market\nin that case. However, when \\theta goes to 0, the value goes to infinity. This\nis in agreement with the above result that is an arbitrage when there is no\ndelay.\n  Our model is also relevant for high frequency trading issues. This is because\nhigh frequency trading often leads to intensive trading taking place on close\nto infinitesimal lengths of time, which in the limit corresponds to trading on\ntime sets of measure 0. This may in turn lead to a singular drift in the\npricing dynamics. See e.g. Lachapelle et al and the references therein.\n",

The classical\nprimal approach is to write down a candidate value function and to use a\nverification argument to prove that this is the solution to the problem.\nHowever, features of the problem take it outside the standard settings of\nstochastic control, and the existing primal verification proofs rely on\nparameter restrictions (especially, but not only, R<1), restrictions on the\nspace of admissible strategies, or intricate approximation arguments.\n  The purpose of this paper is to show that these complications can be overcome\nusing a simple and elegant argument involving a stochastic perturbation of the\nutility function.\n",

        "summary": "  Especially in the insurance industry interest rate models play a crucial role\ne.g. to calculate the insurance company's liabilities, performance scenarios or\nrisk measures. A prominant candidate is the 2-Additive-Factor Gaussian Model\n(Gauss2++) - in a different representation also known as the 2-Factor\nHull-White model. In this paper, we propose a framework to estimate the model\nsuch that it can be applied under the risk neutral and the real world measure\nin a consistent manner. We first show that any progressive and\nsquare-integrable function can be used to specify the change of measure without\nloosing the analytic tractability of e.g. zero-coupon bond prices in both\nworlds. We further propose two time dependent candidates, which are easy to\ncalibrate: a step and a linear function. They represent two variants of our\nframework and distinguish between a short and a long term risk premium, which\nallows to regularize the interest rates in the long horizon. We apply both\nvariants to historical data and show that they indeed produce realistic and\nmuch more stable long term interest rate forecast than the usage of a constant\nfunction. This stability over time would translate to performance scenarios of\ne.g. interest rate sensitive fonds and risk measures.\n",

We call this problem the acceptability maximization. First, we\nstudy the one-period (static) case, and propose a numerical algorithm that\napproximates the original problem by a sequence of risk minimization problems.\nThe results are applied to several important CAIs, such as the gain-to-loss\nratio, the risk-adjusted return on capital and the tail-value-at-risk based\nCAI. In the second part of the paper we investigate the acceptability\nmaximization in a discrete time dynamic setup. Using robust representations of\nCAIs in terms of a family of dynamic coherent risk measures (DCRMs), we\nestablish an intriguing dichotomy: if the corresponding family of DCRMs is\nrecursive (i.e. strongly time consistent) and assuming some recursive structure\nof the market model, then the acceptability maximization problem reduces to\njust a one period problem and the maximal acceptability is constant across all\nstates and times. On the other hand, if the family of DCRMs is not recursive,\nwhich is often the case, then the acceptability maximization problem ordinarily\nis a time-inconsistent stochastic control problem, similar to the classical\nmean-variance criteria. To overcome this form of time-inconsistency, we adapt\nto our setup the set-valued Bellman's principle recently proposed in\n\\cite{KovacovaRudloff2019} applied to two particular dynamic CAIs - the dynamic\nrisk-adjusted return on capital and the dynamic gain-to-loss ratio.

This is the case\nwhen one needs a risk-free (default-free) discounting, but default protection\non funding providers is not traded. For this case, we derive a default\ncompensation factor that describes the present value of a strategy to\ncompensate for default (like buying default protection would do). In a second\npart of the paper, we introduce a model where the survival probability, and\nhence the discount factor, depends on the notional. This model introduces an\neffect not present in the classical modelling of a time-dependent survival\nprobability. Our model allows that large liquidity requirements are more likely\nto default instantly than small ones. Combined, the two models build a\nframework where discounting (and hence valuation) is non-linear: discount\nfactors depend on the amount to be discounted.\n  Our approach builds on top of the classical theory of discounting (which may\neither be given as market-implied or be derived from a model of utility,\nconsumption and production). In that sense, it is rather a generalisation than\nan alternative. The modelling approach has specific relevance for climate\nmodels, where discounting is an important aspect in assessing the severity of\nfuture events. Our model may result in non-decaying discount factors (negative\ndiscount rates) for certain scenarios.\n",

In particular, for the case of a\ncall perturbed by a square bubble, an approximate solution (valid up third\norder in a perturbation series) is given in terms of the three first Greeks:\nDelta, Gamma, and Speed. Then an exact solution is constructed in terms of all\nhigher order $S$-derivatives of the Black-Scholes formula. It is also shown\nthat the interacting Black-Scholes equation is invariant under a discrete\ntransformation that interchanges the interest rate with the mean of the\nunderlying asset and vice versa. This implies that the interacting\nBlack-Scholes equation can be written in a 'low energy' and a 'high energy'\nform, in such a way that the high-interaction limit of the low energy form\ncorresponds to the weak-interaction limit of the high energy form. One can\napply a perturbative analysis to the high energy form to study the\nhigh-interaction limit of the low energy form.\n",

The proposed model is based upon\ntwo desirable properties of the long-term variance process suggested by the\nempirical data: long-term memory and jumps. The proposed model incorporates the\nlong-term memory and positive autocorrelation properties of fractional Brownian\nmotion with $H>1/2$, and the jump properties of the BN-S model. We find\narbitrage-free prices for variance and volatility swaps for this new model.\nBecause fractional Brownian motion is still a Gaussian process, we derive some\nnew expressions for the distributions of integrals of continuous Gaussian\nprocesses as we work towards an analytic expression for the prices of these\nswaps. The model is analyzed in connection to the quadratic hedging problem and\nsome related analytical results are developed. The amount of derivatives\nrequired to minimize a quadratic hedging error is obtained. Finally, we provide\nsome numerical analysis based on the VIX data. Numerical results show the\nefficiency of the proposed model compared to the Heston model and the classical\nBN-S model.\n",

These\nmodels often cause difficulties: no closed formulas for prices, demanding\ncalibration techniques, unclear maps between spot and implied volatility.\nInspired by the practice of using implied volatility as quoting system for\noption prices, models for the joint dynamics of the underlying asset price and\nthe implied volatility have been proposed to replace standard option pricing\nmodels. Starting from Carr and Sun (2014), we develop a framework based on the\nImplied Remaining Variance where minimal conditions for absence of arbitrage\nare identified, and smile bubbles are dealt with. The key concepts arising from\nthe new IRV framework are those of locally consistent dynamics and sandwiched\nmartingale. Within the new IRV framework, the results of Schweizer and Wissel\n(2008b) are reformulated, while those of El Amrani, Jacquier and Martini (2021)\nare independently derived.\n",

The paper thus\ngeneralizes the special case studied in [Liang and Sun, Dynkin games with\nPoisson random intervention times, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 57\n(2019), 2962-2991] where the bondholder has priority ($m=1$), and presents a\ncomplete solution to the callable convertible bond problem with liquidity\nconstraint.

The underlying capital market features a mean-reverting\nprocess for equity returns, and the primary question of interest is how\nmean-reversion effects the optimal strategy and the resulting portfolio value\nat the horizon. In particular, we are interested in knowing under which\nassumptions and on which horizons, the risk-reward trade-off is so favourable\nthat the value of the portfolio is effectively bounded from below on the\nhorizon. In this case, we might think of the portfolio as providing a\nstochastic excess return on top of a \"guarantee\" (the lower bound).\n  Deriving optimal strategies is a well-known discipline in mathematical\nfinance. The modern approach is to derive and solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\n(HJB) differential equation characterizing the strategy leading to highest\nexpected utility, for given utility function. However, for two reasons we\napproach the problem differently in this work. First, we wish to find the\noptimal strategy depending on time only, i.e., we do not allow for dependencies\non capital market state variables, nor the value of the portfolio itself. This\nconstraint characterizes the strategic allocation of long-term investors.\nSecond, to gain insights on the role of mean-reversion, we wish to identify the\nentire family of extremal strategies, not only the optimal strategies.

The traders make prices based on the information available concerning a\nsecurity that pays a random cash flow at a fixed time $T$ in the future. Market\ninformation is modelled in line with the scheme of Brody, Hughston & Macrina\n(2007, 2008) and Brody, Davis, Friedman & Hughston (2009). The risk-neutral\ndistribution of the cash flow is known to the traders, who make prices with a\nfixed multiplicative bid-offer spread and report their prices to a game master\nwho declares that a trade has been made when the bid price of one of the\ntraders crosses the offer price of the other. We prove that the value of the\nfirst trader's position is strictly greater than that of the second. The\nresults are analyzed by use of simulation studies and generalized to situations\nwhere (a) there is a hierarchy of traders, (b) there are multiple successive\ntrades, and (c) there is inventory aversion.\n",

        "summary": "  This article clarifies the relationship between pricing kernel monotonicity\nand the existence of opportunities for stochastic arbitrage in a complete and\nfrictionless market of derivative securities written on a market portfolio. The\nrelationship depends on whether the payoff distribution of the market portfolio\nsatisfies a technical condition called adequacy, meaning that it is atomless or\nis comprised of finitely many equally probable atoms. Under adequacy, pricing\nkernel nonmonotonicity is equivalent to the existence of a strong form of\nstochastic arbitrage involving distributional replication of the market\nportfolio at a lower price. If the adequacy condition is dropped then this\nequivalence no longer holds, but pricing kernel nonmonotonicity remains\nequivalent to the existence of a weaker form of stochastic arbitrage involving\nsecond-order stochastic dominance of the market portfolio at a lower price. A\ngeneralization of the optimal measure preserving derivative is obtained which\nachieves distributional replication at the minimum cost of all second-order\nstochastically dominant securities under adequacy.\n",

We use the dynamic programming\nprinciple to obtain a HJB equation. In no-risk aversion case, we obtain the\nvalue function as a classical solution of a linear pde and derive the\nexpressions for optimal controls by solving the HJB equation.\n",

The model belongs to the class of affine Volterra models.

The value of each bank's project may\nsuddenly decline depending on their cash reserves and both the occurence and\nmagnitude of liquidity shocks. In two distinct settings, we solve the\nsystem-wide optimal control problem and obtain explicit formulas for the unique\noptimal allocations of capital. In the first decentralized setting, banks seek\nonly to maximize their own expected utility. Second, a central planner aims to\nmaximize the sum of all banks' expected utilities. Both of the resulting\nnetworks exhibit a `core-periphery' structure in equilibrium. However, in the\ndecentralized setting, banks elect to hold less cash reserves compared to the\ncentralized setting, leading to greater susceptibility to liquidity shortages.\nWe characterize the behavior of the planner's optimal allocation as the size of\nthe system grows. Surprisingly, the relative welfare gap is of constant order.\nFinally, we derive co-investment requirements that allow the decentralized\nsystem to achieve the planner's optimal level of risk. In doing so, we find\nthat banks in the network's core are subjected to the highest co-investment\nrequirements -- ensuring that they are sufficiently incentivized to hold\nsignificant cash reserves. Our analysis may inform regulators' requirements on\nbanks' liquidity reserves, as have been debated in the wake of the 2023\nregional banking crisis in the US.\n",

Within the framework, we propose a novel approach to handle jumps in\norder to neutralise their negative impact on the estimates of the key\nparameters of the model. An improvement of the sampling in the particle\nfiltering method is discussed as well.

This amount is well-understood\nfor loans at compound interest, but much less so when simple interest is used.\n  Recently, Aretusi and Mari (2018) have proposed a formula for the payoff\namount for loans at simple interest. We assume that the payoff amounts are\nestablished contractually at time zero, whence the requirement that no\narbitrage may arise this way\n  The first goal of this paper is to study this new formula and derive it\nwithin a model of a loan market in which loans are bought and sold at simple\ninterest, interest rates change over time, and no arbitrage opportunities\nexist.\n  The second goal is to show that this formula exhibits a behaviour rather\ndifferent from the one which occurs when compound interest is used. Indeed, we\nshow that, if the installments are constant and if the interest rate is greater\nthan a critical value (which depends on the number of installments), then the\nsequence of the payoff amounts is increasing before a certain critical time,\nand will start decreasing only thereafter. We also show that the critical value\nis decreasing as a function of the number of installments. For two\ninstallments, the critical value is equal to the golden section.\n  The third goal is to introduce a more efficient polynomial notation, which\nencodes a basic tenet of the subject: Each amount of money is embedded in a\ntime position (to wit: The time when it is due). The model of a loan market we\npropose is naturally linked to this new notation.\n",

Using tools from\nrough path theory, we describe how to precisely understand the conditional LSV\ndynamics and reveal their Markovian nature. The latter allows us to connect the\nconditional dynamics to so-called rough partial differential equations (RPDEs),\nthrough a Feynman-Kac type of formula. In terms of European pricing,\nconditional on realizations of one Brownian motion, we can compute conditional\noption prices by solving the corresponding linear RPDEs, and then average over\nall samples to find unconditional prices. Our approach depends only minimally\non the specification of the volatility, making it applicable for a wide range\nof classical and rough LSV models, and it establishes a PDE pricing method for\nnon-Markovian models. Finally, we present a first glimpse at numerical methods\nfor RPDEs and apply them to price European options in several rough LSV models.\n",

That is, each investor\nis concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it compares to the\naverage terminal wealth of all investors. At the inter-personal level, each\ninvestor selects a trading strategy in response to others' strategies. This\nselected strategy additionally needs to yield an equilibrium intra-personally,\nso as to resolve time inconsistency among the investor's current and future\nselves (triggered by the mean-variance objective). A Nash equilibrium we look\nfor is thus a tuple of trading strategies under which every investor achieves\nher intra-personal equilibrium simultaneously. We derive such a Nash\nequilibrium explicitly in the idealized case of full information (i.e., the\ndynamics of the underlying stock is perfectly known) and semi-explicitly in the\nrealistic case of partial information (i.e., the stock evolution is observed,\nbut the expected return of the stock is not precisely known). The formula under\npartial information consists of the myopic trading and intertemporal hedging\nterms, both of which depend on an additional state process that serves to\nfilter the true expected return and whose influence on trading is captured by a\ndegenerate Cauchy problem. Our results identify that relative performance\ncriteria can induce downward self-reinforcement of investors' wealth--if every\ninvestor suffers a wealth decline simultaneously, then everyone's wealth tends\nto decline further. This phenomenon, as numerical examples show, is negligible\nunder full information but pronounced under partial information.\n",

In the analysis, we examine two effects:\nthe distortion effect on total welfare and the advantage effect of information\nand highlight their key factors of influence, with a particular emphasis on the\nproportion of investors.

We derive option price formulas and extend our analysis to the\nterm structure of interest rates by deriving the pricing of zero-coupon bonds,\nforward contracts, and futures contracts. We identify a necessary condition for\nthe unified model to support a perpetual derivative. Discrete binomial pricing\nunder the unified model is also developed. In every scenario analyzed, we show\nthat the unified model simplifies to the standard Black-Scholes-Merton pricing\nunder specific limits and provides pricing in the Bachelier model limit. We\nnote that the Bachelier limit within the unified model allows for positive\nriskless rates.

We\nthen use neural nets to represent the term structures of the location, the\nscale, and the higher-order moments, and impose stringent conditions on the\nlearning process to ensure the neural net-based curve representation is free of\nstatic arbitrage. This specification is structurally clear in that it separates\nthe modeling of randomness from the modeling of the term structures of the\nparameters. It is data adaptive in that we use neural nets to represent the\nshape of the stochastic curve. It is also generative in that the functional\nform of the stochastic curve, although parameterized by neural nets, is an\nexplicit and deterministic function of the standard normal. This explicitness\nallows for the efficient generation of samples to price options across strikes\nand maturities, without compromising data adaptability. We have validated the\neffectiveness of this approach by benchmarking it against a comprehensive set\nof baseline models. Experiments show that the extracted risk-neutral densities\naccommodate a diverse range of shapes. Its accuracy significantly outperforms\nthe extensive set of baseline models--including three parametric models and\nnine stochastic process models--in terms of accuracy and stability.

Depending whether the stock price $S$ or its logarithm\nis the main driving noise/shock in the Esscher definition, we obtained two\nclasses of second-order Esscher densities called linear class and exponential\nclass respectively. Using the semimartingale characteristics to parametrize\n$S$, we characterize the second-order Esscher densities (exponential and\nlinear) using pointwise equations. The role of the second order concept is\nhighlighted in many manners and the relationship between the two classes is\nsingled out for the one-dimensional case. Furthermore, when $S$ is a compound\nPoisson model, we show how both classes are related to the\nDelbaen-Haenzendonck's risk-neutral measure. Afterwards, we restrict our model\n$S$ to follow the jump-diffusion model, for simplicity only, and address the\nbounds of the stochastic Esscher pricing intervals. In particular, no matter\nwhat is the Esscher class, we prove that both bounds (upper and lower) are\nsolutions to the same linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE\nhereafter for short) but with two different constraints. This shows that BSDEs\nwith constraints appear also in a setting beyond the classical cases of\nconstraints on gain-processes or constraints on portfolios. We prove that our\nresulting constrained BSDEs have solutions in our framework for a large class\nof claims' payoffs including any bounded claim, in contrast to the literature,\nand we single out the monotonic sequence of BSDEs that ``naturally\" approximate\nit as well.\n",

We\naddress the challenge of an uncertain investment horizon caused by an exogenous\nrandom default time, after which neither the agent nor the principal can access\nthe market. This uncertainty introduces significant complexities in analyzing\nthe problem, requiring distinct mathematical approaches for two cases: when the\nrandom default time falls within the initial time frame [0,T] and when it\nextends beyond this period. We develop a theoretical framework to model the\nstochastic dynamics of the investment process, incorporating the random default\ntime.

In the second case, where the default time is within the\ninterval [0,T], the problem becomes more intricate due to the degeneracy of the\nBSDE's driver.

This paper formulates the robust mean-field game for a\nnon-linear system originating from the variance principle and the 4/2 model.\nFor the case of an exponential utility function, we derive closed-form\nsolutions for the $n$-insurer game and the corresponding mean-field game. We\nshow that relative concerns lead to new hedging terms in the investment and\nreinsurance strategies. Model uncertainty can significantly change the\ninsurers' hedging demands. The hedging demands in the investment-reinsurance\nstrategies exhibit highly non-linear dependence with the insurers' competitive\ncoefficients, risk aversion and ambiguity aversion coefficients.

To tackle the\ntime-inconsistency, we seek both the closed-loop and the open-loop Nash\nequilibrium controls as time-consistent solutions. We establish a partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) system for deriving a closed-loop Nash equilibrium\ncontrol, which does not include the equilibrium value function and is different\nfrom the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations as in Bj\\\"ork et al.\n(Finance Stoch. 21: 331-360, 2017). We show that our PDE system is equivalent\nto the extended HJB equations that seems difficult to be solved for our\nhigher-order moment problems. In deriving an open-loop Nash equilibrium\ncontrol, due to the non-separable higher-order moments in the objective\nfunction, we make some moment estimates in addition to the standard\nperturbation argument for developing a maximum principle. Then, the problem is\nreduced to solving a flow of forward-backward stochastic differential\nequations. In particular, we investigate linear controlled dynamics and some\nobjective functions affine in the mean. The closed-loop and the open-loop Nash\nequilibrium controls are identical, which are independent of the state value,\nrandom path and the preference on the odd-order central moments. By sending the\nhighest order of central moments to infinity, we obtain the time-consistent\nsolutions to some control problems whose objective functions include some\npenalty functions for deviation.\n",

We obtain a general\npricing-hedging duality result: the infimum over superhedging prices is equal\nto supremum over calibrated martingale measures. In presence of non-trivial\nbeliefs, the equality is between limiting values of perturbed problems. In\nparticular, our results include the martingale optimal transport duality of\nDolinsky and Soner (2013) and extend it to multiple dimensions and multiple\nmaturities.\n",

The objective of this manuscript is to present an\noriginal self-contained treatment of the multidimensional pricing. During the\npast decades the Black-Scholes this model, which essentially is based on the\nlog-normal assumption, has been increasingly criticised. In particular, it was\nnoticed by Mandelbrot that empirical log-returns distributions are more\nconcentrated around the origin and have considerably heavier tails. This\nsuggests to adjust the Black-Scholes model by the introduction of the Levy\nprocesses instead of Brownian ones. This approach has been extensively studied\nin a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the\ntheory is not so advanced. We present a general method of high-dimensional\noption pricing based on a wide range of jump-diffusion models. Namely, we\nconstruct approximation formulas for the price of spread options. It is\nimportant to get an efficient approximation for the respective density\nfunction, since the reward function has usually a simple structure. Instead of\na commonly used tabulation approach, we use the respective m-widths to compare\na wide range of numerical methods. We give an algorithm of almost optimal, in\nthe sense of the respective m-widths, reconstruction of density functions. To\ndemonstrate the power of our approach we consider in details a concrete class\nof Levy driven processes and present the respective rates of convergence of\napproximation formulas. The interrelationship between the theory and tools\nreflects the richness and deep connections in Financial Mathematics, Stochastic\nProcesses, Theory of Martingales, Functional Analysis, Topology and Harmonic\nAnalysis.\n",

For a\nfrictionless market consisting of $d$ risky assets with continuous price\ntrajectories, we show that the purely analytic problem of finding the minimal\nsuperhedging price of a path dependent European option has the same value as\nthe purely probabilistic problem of finding the supremum of the expectations of\nthe option over all martingale measures. The superhedging problem is formulated\nwith simple trading strategies, the claim is the limit inferior of continuous\nfunctions, which allows for upper and lower semi-continuous claims, and\nsuperhedging is required in the pathwise sense on a $\\sigma$-compact sample\nspace of price trajectories. If the sample space is stable under stopping, the\nprobabilistic problem reduces to finding the supremum over all martingale\nmeasures with compact support. As an application of the general results we\ndeduce dualities for Vovk's outer measure and semi-static superhedging with\nfinitely many securities.\n",

The surplus dynamics obeys a linearly\ncontrolled drifted Brownian motion that is reflected at the origin, dividends\ngive rise to time-dependent instantaneous marginal profits, whereas capital\ninjections are subject to time-dependent instantaneous marginal costs. The aim\nis to maximize the sum of a liquidation value at terminal time and of the total\nexpected profits from dividends, net of the total expected costs for capital\ninjections. Inspired by the study of El Karoui and Karatzas (1989) on reflected\nfollower problems, we relate the optimal dividend problem with capital\ninjections to an optimal stopping problem for a drifted Brownian motion that is\nabsorbed at the origin. We show that whenever the optimal stopping rule is\ntriggered by a time-dependent boundary, the value function of the optimal\nstopping problem gives the derivative of the value function of the optimal\ndividend problem. Moreover, the optimal dividend strategy is also triggered by\nthe moving boundary of the associated stopping problem. The properties of this\nboundary are then investigated in a case study in which instantaneous marginal\nprofits and costs from dividends and capital injections are constants\ndiscounted at a constant rate.\n",

The setup is\nstrongly related to a DC pension plan where additionally (individual)\nconsumption is taken into account. The consumption rate is subject to a\ntime-varying minimum level and terminal wealth is subject to a terminal floor.\nMoreover, the preference between consumption and terminal wealth as well as the\nintertemporal coefficient of risk aversion are time-varying and therefore\ndepend on the age of the considered pension cohort. The optimal consumption and\ninvestment policies are calculated in the case of a Black-Scholes financial\nmarket framework and hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility\nfunctions. We generalize Ye (2008) (2008 American Control Conference, 356-362)\nby adding an age-dependent coefficient of risk aversion and extend Steffensen\n(2011) (Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 35(5), 659-667), Hentschel\n(2016) (Doctoral dissertation, Ulm University) and Aase (2017) (Stochastics,\n89(1), 115-141) by considering consumption in combination with terminal wealth\nand allowing for consumption and terminal wealth floors via an application of\nHARA utility functions. A case study on fitting several models to realistic,\ntime-dependent life-cycle consumption and relative investment profiles shows\nthat only our extended model with time-varying preference parameters provides\nsufficient flexibility for an adequate fit. This is of particular interest to\nlife-cycle products for (private) pension investments or pension insurance in\ngeneral.\n",

Since the\npreferential attachment in the BA model does not consider any stop against the\ninfinite growth of networks, we introduce a modified version of preferential\nattachment of the BA model. This idea makes sense because the growth of real\nnetworks may be finite. In the present study, by combining preferential\nattachment in the science of temporal networks (interval graphs), and, the\nfirst-order differential equations of value and cost of making links, the\nfuture equilibrium of an evolving network is illustrated.

The relevant scenarios or market states\nare specified via an information system given by a $\\sigma$-algebra and so this\nnotion contains classical arbitrage as a special case. It also covers the\nnotion of statistical arbitrage introduced in Bondarenko (2003).\n  Relaxing these notions further we introduce generalized profitable strategies\nwhich include also static or semi-static strategies. Under standard\nno-arbitrage there may exist generalized gain strategies yielding positive\ngains on average under the specified scenarios.\n  In the first part of the paper we characterize these generalized statistical\nno-arbitrage notions. In the second part of the paper we construct several\nprofitable generalized strategies with respect to various choices of the\ninformation system. In particular, we consider several forms of embedded\nbinomial strategies and follow-the-trend strategies as well as partition-type\nstrategies. We study and compare their behaviour on simulated data.\nAdditionally, we find good performance on market data of these simple\nstrategies which makes them profitable candidates for real applications.\n",

        "summary": "  High future discounting rates favor inaction on present expending while lower\nrates advise for a more immediate political action. A possible approach to this\nkey issue in global economy is to take historical time series for nominal\ninterest rates and inflation, and to construct then real interest rates and\nfinally obtaining the resulting discount rate according to a specific\nstochastic model. Extended periods of negative real interest rates, in which\ninflation dominates over nominal rates, are commonly observed, occurring in\nmany epochs and in all countries. This feature leads us to choose a well-known\nmodel in statistical physics, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, as a basic\ndynamical tool in which real interest rates randomly fluctuate and can become\nnegative, even if they tend to revert to a positive mean value. By covering 14\ncountries over hundreds of years we suggest different scenarios and include an\nerror analysis in order to consider the impact of statistical uncertainty in\nour results. We find that only 4 of the countries have positive long-run\ndiscount rates while the other ten countries have negative rates. Even if one\nrejects the countries where hyperinflation has occurred, our results support\nthe need to consider low discounting rates. The results provided by these\nfourteen countries significantly increase the priority of confronting global\nactions such as climate change mitigation. We finally extend the analysis by\nfirst allowing for fluctuations of the mean level in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nmodel and secondly by considering modified versions of the Feller and lognormal\nmodels. In both cases, results remain basically unchanged thus demonstrating\nthe robustness of the results presented.\n",

The reinsurer, as the leader of the Stackelberg game, can price\nreinsurance premium and invest its wealth in a financial market that contains a\nrisk-free asset and a risky asset. The two insurers, as the followers of the\nStackelberg game, can purchase proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer and\ninvest in the same financial market. The competitive relationship between two\ninsurers is modeled by the non-zero-sum game, and their decision making will\nconsider the relative performance measured by the difference in their terminal\nwealth. We consider wealth processes with delay to characterize the bounded\nmemory feature. This paper aims to find the equilibrium strategy for the\nreinsurer and insurers by maximizing the expected utility of the reinsurer's\nterminal wealth with delay and maximizing the expected utility of the\ncombination of insurers' terminal wealth and the relative performance with\ndelay. By using the idea of backward induction and the dynamic programming\napproach, we derive the equilibrium strategy and value functions explicitly.\nThen, we provide the corresponding verification theorem. Finally, some\nnumerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the\neffects of model parameters on the equilibrium strategy. We find the delay\nfactor discourages or stimulates investment depending on the length of delay.\nMoreover, competitive factors between two insurers make their optimal\nreinsurance-investment strategy interact, and reduce reinsurance demand and\nreinsurance premium price.\n",

Our sensitivities are thus\nfully non-parametric. We show that the results entangle the baseline model\nspecification and the agent's risk attitudes.

        "summary": "  The aim of this paper is to study a new methodological framework for systemic\nrisk measures by applying deep learning method as a tool to compute the optimal\nstrategy of capital allocations. Under this new framework, systemic risk\nmeasures can be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash that secures the\naggregated system by allocating capital to the single institutions before\naggregating the individual risks. This problem has no explicit solution except\nin very limited situations. Deep learning is increasingly receiving attention\nin financial modelings and risk management and we propose our deep learning\nbased algorithms to solve both the primal and dual problems of the risk\nmeasures, and thus to learn the fair risk allocations. In particular, our\nmethod for the dual problem involves the training philosophy inspired by the\nwell-known Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) approach and a newly designed\ndirect estimation of Radon-Nikodym derivative. We close the paper with\nsubstantial numerical studies of the subject and provide interpretations of the\nrisk allocations associated to the systemic risk measures. In the particular\ncase of exponential preferences, numerical experiments demonstrate excellent\nperformance of the proposed algorithm, when compared with the optimal explicit\nsolution as a benchmark.\n",

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic model on optimal\nliquidation in the presence of an asset bubble. Our setup allows the influx of\nplayers to fuel the price of the asset. Moreover, traders will enter the market\nat possibly different times and take advantage of the uptrend at the risk of an\ninevitable crash. In particular, we consider two types of crashes: an\nendogenous burst which results from excessive selling, and an exogenous burst\nwhich cannot be anticipated and is independent from the actions of the traders.\n  The popularity of asset bubbles suggests a large-population setting, which\nnaturally leads to a mean field game (MFG) formulation. We introduce a class of\nMFGs with varying entry times. In particular, an equilibrium will depend on the\nentry-weighted average of conditional optimal strategies. To incorporate the\nexogenous burst time, we adopt the method of progressive enlargement of\nfiltrations. We prove existence of MFG equilibria using the weak formulation in\na generalized setup, and we show that the equilibrium strategy can be\ndecomposed into before-and-after-burst segments, each part containing only the\nmarket information.

The decision\nmaker (DM) is uncertain about the dominated priors of the financial market,\nwhich are characterized by a second-order distribution (SOD). The KMM model\nseparates risk attitudes and ambiguity attitudes apart and the aim of the DM is\nto maximize the two-fold utility of terminal wealth, which does not belong to\nthe classical subjective utility maximization problem. By constructing the\nefficient frontier, the original KMM problem is first simplified as an one-fold\nexpected utility problem on the second-order space. In order to solve the\nequivalent simplified problem, this paper imposes an assumption and introduces\na new distorted Legendre transformation to establish the bipolar relation and\nthe distorted duality theorem. Then, under a further assumption that the\nasymptotic elasticity of the ambiguous attitude is less than 1, the uniqueness\nand existence of the solution to the KMM problem are shown and we obtain the\nsemi-explicit forms of the optimal terminal wealth and the optimal strategy.\nExplicit forms of optimal strategies are presented for CRRA, CARA and HARA\nutilities in the case of Gaussian SOD in a Black-Scholes financial market,\nwhich show that DM with higher ambiguity aversion tends to be more concerned\nabout extreme market conditions with larger bias. In the end of this work,\nnumerical comparisons with the DMs ignoring ambiguity are revealed to\nillustrate the effects of ambiguity on the optimal strategies and value\nfunctions.\n",

One of the most\ncrucial, yet restrictive, assumptions for this task is that the market follows\na geometric Brownian motion, which has been relaxed and generalized in various\nways.\n  The concept of robust finance revolves around developing models that account\nfor uncertainties and variations in financial markets. Martingale Optimal\nTransport, which is an adaptation of the Optimal Transport theory to the robust\nfinancial framework, is one of the most prominent directions.

As main example for such feature maps we consider\nthe signature of the (ranked) market weights. We prove that these portfolios\nare universal in the sense that every continuous, possibly path-dependent,\nportfolio function of the market weights can be uniformly approximated by\nsignature portfolios. We also show that signature portfolios can approximate\nthe growth-optimal portfolio in several classes of non-Markovian market models\narbitrarily well and illustrate numerically that the trained signature\nportfolios are remarkably close to the theoretical growth-optimal portfolios.\nBesides these universality features, the main numerical advantage lies in the\nfact that several optimization tasks like maximizing (expected) logarithmic\nwealth or mean-variance optimization within the class of linear path-functional\nportfolios reduce to a convex quadratic optimization problem, thus making it\ncomputationally highly tractable. We apply our method also to real market data\nbased on several indices. Our results point towards out-performance on the\nconsidered out-of-sample data, also in the presence of transaction costs.\n",

(ii) For a given executed volume $Q$, the market impact is\nproportional to $\\sqrt{\\gamma}$, where $\\gamma$ denotes the participation rate,\nfor $\\gamma$ large enough.

The original model is recast into\nan online learning framework, which is free from any statistical assumptions,\nto propose a dynamic strategy of sequential portfolios such that its empirical\nutility, Sharpe ratio, and growth rate asymptotically achieve those of the true\nportfolio, derived with perfect knowledge of the future data.\n  When the distribution of future data has a normal shape, the growth rate of\nwealth is shown to increase by lifting the portfolio along the efficient\nfrontier through the calibration of risk aversion. Since risk aversion cannot\nbe appropriately predetermined, another proposed algorithm updating this\ncoefficient over time forms a dynamic strategy approaching the optimal\nempirical Sharpe ratio or growth rate associated with the true coefficient. The\nperformance of these proposed strategies is universally guaranteed under\nspecific stochastic markets. Furthermore, in stationary and ergodic markets,\nthe so-called Bayesian strategy utilizing true conditional distributions, based\non observed past market information during investment, almost surely does not\nperform better than the proposed strategies in terms of empirical utility,\nSharpe ratio, or growth rate, which, in contrast, do not rely on conditional\ndistributions.\n",

Market makers are\nimportant for the proper functioning of financial markets worldwide. Given the\nimportance, financial mathematics has endeavored to derive optimal strategies\nfor placing limit orders in this context. This paper identifies a key\ndiscrepancy between popular model assumptions and the realities of real\nmarkets, specifically regarding the dynamics around limit order fills.\nTraditionally, market making models rely on an assumption of low-cost random\nfills, when in reality we observe a high-cost non-random fill behavior. Namely,\nlimit order fills are caused by and coincide with adverse price movements,\nwhich create a drag on the market maker's profit and loss. We refer to this\nphenomenon as \"the negative drift\" associated with limit order fills. We\ndescribe a discrete market model and prove theoretically that the negative\ndrift exists. We also provide a detailed empirical simulation using one of the\nmost traded financial instruments in the world, the 10 Year US Treasury Bond\nfutures, which also confirms its existence.

We extend the model\nof Milionis et al. [2022] for a general class of two asset AMMs to both\nintroduce fees and discrete Poisson block generation times. In our setting, we\nare able to compute the expected instantaneous rate of arbitrage profit in\nclosed form. When the fees are low, in the fast block asymptotic regime, the\nimpact of fees takes a particularly simple form: fees simply scale down\narbitrage profits by the fraction of time that an arriving arbitrageur finds a\nprofitable trade.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper presents a dynamic game framework to analyze the role of large\nbanks in the interbank market. By extending existing models, we incorporate a\nmajor bank as a dynamic decision-maker interacting with multiple small banks.\nUsing the mean field game methodology and convex analysis, best-response\ntrading strategies are derived, leading to an approximate equilibrium for the\ninterbank market. We investigate the influence of the large bank on the market\nstability by examining individual default probabilities and systemic risk,\nthrough the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that, when the\nsize of the major bank is not excessively large, it can positively contribute\nto market stability. However, there is also the potential for negative\nspillover effects in the event of default, leading to an increase in systemic\nrisk. The magnitude of this impact is further influenced by the size and\ntrading rate of the major bank. Overall, this study provides valuable insights\ninto the management of systemic risk in the interbank market.\n",

A regulatory body imposes a lower\nbound on the amount of energy each regulated firm must generate via solar\nmeans, providing them with a tradeable certificate for each MWh generated.\nFirms seek to navigate the market optimally by modulating their SREC generation\nand trading rates. As such, the SREC market can be viewed as a stochastic game,\nwhere agents interact through the SREC price. We study this stochastic game by\nsolving the mean-field game (MFG) limit with sub-populations of heterogeneous\nagents. Market participants optimize costs accounting for trading frictions,\ncost of generation, non-linear non-compliance costs, and generation\nuncertainty. Moreover, we endogenize SREC price through market clearing. We\ncharacterize firms' optimal controls as the solution of McKean-Vlasov (MV)\nFBSDEs and determine the equilibrium SREC price. We establish the existence and\nuniqueness of a solution to this MV-FBSDE, and prove that the MFG strategies\nform an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite player game. Finally, we\ndevelop a numerical scheme for solving the MV-FBSDEs and conduct a simulation\nstudy.\n",

The results demonstrate that a dynamic strategy,\nwhich forms a portfolio based on perfect knowledge of the dependence structure\nand full market information over time, may not grow at a higher rate infinitely\noften than a constant strategy, which remains invariant over time.\nSpecifically, if the market is stationary, implying that the dependence\nstructure is statistically stable, the growth rate of an optimal dynamic\nstrategy, utilizing the maximum capacity of the entire market information,\nalmost surely decays over time into an equilibrium state, asymptotically\nconverging to the growth rate of a constant strategy.\n  Technically, this work reassesses the common belief that a constant strategy\nonly attains the optimal limiting growth rate of dynamic strategies when the\nmarket process is identically and independently distributed. By analyzing the\ndynamic log-optimal portfolio strategy as the optimal benchmark in a stationary\nmarket with side information, we show that a random optimal constant strategy\nalmost surely exists, even when a limiting growth rate for the dynamic strategy\ndoes not. Consequently, two approaches to learning algorithms for portfolio\nconstruction are discussed, demonstrating the safety of removing side\ninformation from the learning process while still guaranteeing an asymptotic\ngrowth rate comparable to that of the optimal dynamic strategy.\n",
