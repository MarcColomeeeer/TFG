        "summary": "  Markowitz (1952, 1959) laid down the ground-breaking work on the\nmean-variance analysis. Under his framework, the theoretical optimal allocation\nvector can be very different from the estimated one for large portfolios due to\nthe intrinsic difficulty of estimating a vast covariance matrix and return\nvector. This can result in adverse performance in portfolio selected based on\nempirical data due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We address this\nproblem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio\nselection. We show that with gross-exposure constraint the theoretical optimal\nportfolios have similar performance to the empirically selected ones based on\nestimated covariance matrices and there is no error accumulation effect from\nestimation of vast covariance matrices. This gives theoretical justification to\nthe empirical results in Jagannathan and Ma (2003). We also show that the\nno-short-sale portfolio is not diversified enough and can be improved by\nallowing some short positions. As the constraint on short sales relaxes, the\nnumber of selected assets varies from a small number to the total number of\nstocks, when tracking portfolios or selecting assets. This achieves the optimal\nsparse portfolio selection, which has close performance to the theoretical\noptimal one. Among 1000 stocks, for example, we are able to identify all\noptimal subsets of portfolios of different sizes, their associated allocation\nvectors, and their estimated risks. The utility of our new approach is\nillustrated by simulation and empirical studies on the 100 Fama-French\nindustrial portfolios and the 400 stocks randomly selected from Russell 3000.\n",

This is a singular stochastic control problem,inherently in a finite\ntime horizon. With a series of transformations, the problem is turned into a\nso-called double obstacle problem, a well studied problem in physics and\npartial differential equation literature, featuring two time-varying free\nboundaries. The two boundaries, which define the buy, sell, and no-trade\nregions, are proved to be smooth in time. This in turn characterizes the\noptimal strategy, via a Skorokhod problem, as one that tries to keep a certain\nadjusted bond-stock position within the no-trade region. Several features of\nthe optimal strategy are revealed that are remarkably different from its\nno-transaction-cost counterpart. It is shown that there exists a critical\nlength in time, which is dependent on the stock excess return as well as the\ntransaction fees but independent of the investment target and the stock\nvolatility, so that an expected terminal return may not be achievable if the\nplanning horizon is shorter than that critical length (while in the absence of\ntransaction costs any expected return can be reached in an arbitrary period of\ntime). It is further demonstrated that anyone following the optimal strategy\nshould not buy the stock beyond the point when the time to maturity is shorter\nthan the aforementioned critical length. Moreover, the investor would be less\nlikely to buy the stock and more likely to sell the stock when the maturity\ndate is getting closer. These features, while consistent with the widely\naccepted investment wisdom, suggest that the planning horizon is an integral\npart of the investment opportunities.\n",

As a result, the dynamic\nmean-variance efficient frontier, though still a straight line, is strictly\nabove the entire risky region. This in turn suggests a positive premium, in\nterms of the Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, arising from the dynamic\ntrading. Another implication is that the inclusion of a risk-free asset boosts\nthe Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, which again contrasts sharply with\nthe single-period case.\n",

One no longer has the continuity of the\nvalue function without posing further conditions due to the degeneracy and the\ndependence of the random terminal time on the initial data. This paper provides\nsufficient conditions under which the continuity of the value function is\nobtained. The essence of our approach is to find a sequence of continuous\nfunctions locally uniformly converging to the desired value function.

Then, by separating the utility\nmaximization problem into the pre-default and post-default scenarios, we deduce\ntwo coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for the post and pre-default\noptimal value functions and show a novel verification theorem for their\nsolutions. We obtain explicit optimal investment strategies and value functions\nfor an investor with logarithmic utility. We finish with an economic analysis\nin the case of a market with two regimes and homogenous transition rates, and\nshow the impact of the default intensities and loss rates on the optimal\nstrategies and value functions.\n",

However, the minimum guaranteed\nportfolio value at the end of the investment horizon is not deterministic\nanymore, but subject to systematic risk instead. With respect to the comparison\nof the two strategies, various criteria are applied such as comparison of\nterminal payoffs and payoff distributions. General analytical expressions for\nall moments of both performance participation strategies as well as standard\nOBPI and CPPI are derived.

We abstract from utility, bequest and consumption preference\nissues by treating the VA as liquid and tradable. This allows us to use an\nAmerican option pricing framework to derive a so-called optimal initiation\nregion. Our main practical finding is that given current design parameters in\nwhich volatility (asset allocation) is restricted to less than 20%, while\nguaranteed payout rates (GPR) as well as bonus (roll-up) rates are less than\n5%, GLWBs that are in-the-money should be turned on by the late 50s and\ncertainly the early 60s. The exception to the rule is when a non-constant GPR\nis about to increase (soon) to a higher age band, in which case the optimal\npolicy is to wait until the new GPR is hit and then initiate immediately. Also,\nto offer a different perspective, we invert the model and solve for the bonus\n(roll-up) rate that is required to justify delaying initiation at any age. We\nfind that the required bonus is quite high and more than what is currently\npromised by existing products. Our methodology and results should be of\ninterest to researchers as well as to the individuals that collectively have\nover \\$1 USD trillion in aggregate invested in these products. We conclude by\nsuggesting that much of the non-initiation at older age is irrational (which\nobviously benefits the insurance industry.)\n",

Among the existing downside risk measures,\nthe lower-partial moments (LPM) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are\nprobably most promising. In this paper we investigate the dynamic mean-LPM and\nmean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems in continuous-time, while the current\nliterature has only witnessed their static versions.

The limit funding level not only enables us to solve both\ndynamic mean-LPM and mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems, but also offers\na flexibility to tame the aggressiveness of the portfolio policies generated\nfrom such mean - downside risk models. More specifically, for a general market\nsetting, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Lagrangian multiplies,\nwhich is a key step in applying the martingale approach, and establish a\ntheoretical foundation for developing efficient numerical solution approaches.\nMoreover, for situations where the opportunity set of the market setting is\ndeterministic, we derive analytical portfolio policies for both dynamic\nmean-LPM and mean-CVaR formulations.\n",

This\nquantile optimization problem is known as the quantile formulation of the\noriginal investment problem. Under certain monotonicity assumptions, several\nschemes to solve such quantile optimization problems have been proposed in the\nliterature. In this paper, we propose a change-of-variable and relaxation\nmethod to solve the quantile optimization problems without using the calculus\nof variations or making any monotonicity assumptions. The method is\ndemonstrated through a portfolio choice problem under rank-dependent utility\ntheory (RDUT). We show that this problem is equivalent to a classical Merton's\nportfolio choice problem under expected utility theory with the same utility\nfunction but a different pricing kernel explicitly determined by the given\npricing kernel and probability weighting function. With this result, the\nfeasibility, well-posedness, attainability and uniqueness issues for the\nportfolio choice problem under RDUT are solved. It is also shown that solving\nfunctional optimization problems may reduce to solving probabilistic\noptimization problems. The method is applicable to general models with\nlaw-invariant preference measures including portfolio choice models under\ncumulative prospect theory (CPT) or RDUT, Yaari's dual model, Lopes' SP/A\nmodel, and optimal stopping models under CPT or RDUT.\n",

In modern portfolio theory, we typically find asset returns that are\nmodeled by a random variable with an elliptical distribution and the notion of\nportfolio risk is described by an appropriate risk measure. In this paper, we\npropose new stochastic models for the asset returns that are based on Jumps-\nDiffusion (J-D) distributions. This family of distributions are more compatible\nwith stylized features of asset returns. On the other hand, in the past\ndecades, we find attempts in the literature to use well-known risk measures,\nsuch as Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall, in this context. Unfortunately,\none drawback with these previous approaches is that no explicit formulas are\navailable and numerical approximations are used to solve the optimization\nproblem. In this paper, we propose to use a new coherent risk measure,\nso-called, Entropic Value at Risk(EVaR), in the optimization problem. For\ncertain models, including a jump-diffusion distribution, this risk measure\nyields an explicit formula for the objective function so that the optimization\nproblem can be solved without resorting to numerical approximations.\n",

One is the striking negative correlation between past\nrealized volatility and dividend yield. Second is the fact that ex-dividend\nreturns themselves are weakly dependent on the volatility level, leading to\nbetter risk-adjusted returns for low-vol stocks. This effect is further\namplified by compounding. We find that the low-vol strategy is not associated\nto short term reversals, nor does it qualify as a Risk-Premium strategy, since\nits overall skewness is slightly positive. For practical purposes, the strong\ndividend bias and the resulting correlation with other valuation metrics (such\nas Earnings to Price or Book to Price) does make the low-vol strategies to some\nextent redundant, at least for equities.\n",

        "summary": "  The optimization of the variance supplemented by a budget constraint and an\nasymmetric $\\ell_1$ regularizer is carried out analytically by the replica\nmethod borrowed from the theory of disordered systems. The asymmetric\nregularizer allows us to penalize short and long positions differently, so the\npresent treatment includes the no-short-constrained portfolio optimization\nproblem as a special case. Results are presented for the out-of-sample and the\nin-sample estimator of the regularized variance, the relative estimation error,\nthe density of the assets eliminated from the portfolio by the regularizer, and\nthe distribution of the optimal portfolio weights. We have studied the\ndependence of these quantities on the ratio $r$ of the portfolio's dimension\n$N$ to the sample size $T$, and on the strength of the regularizer. We have\nchecked the analytic results by numerical simulations, and found general\nagreement. Regularization extends the interval where the optimization can be\ncarried out, and suppresses the large sample fluctuations, but the performance\nof $\\ell_1$ regularization is rather disappointing: if the sample size is large\nrelative to the dimension, i.e. $r$ is small, the regularizer does not play any\nrole, while for $r$'s where the regularizer starts to be felt the estimation\nerror is already so large as to make the whole optimization exercise pointless.\nWe find that the $\\ell_1$ regularization can eliminate at most half the assets\nfrom the portfolio, corresponding to this there is a critical ratio $r=2$\nbeyond which the $\\ell_1$ regularized variance cannot be optimized: the\nregularized variance becomes constant over the simplex. These facts do not seem\nto have been noticed in the literature.\n",

We first present a comparative study\nof recurrent neural network models (RNNs), including a simple RNN, long\nshort-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for selecting the best\npredictor to use in portfolio construction. The models are applied to the\ninvestment universe consisted of ten stocks in the S&P500. The experimental\nresults shows that LSTM outperforms the others in terms of hit ratio of\none-month-ahead forecasts. We then build predictive threshold-based portfolios\n(TBPs) that are subsets of the universe satisfying given threshold criteria for\nthe predicted returns. The TBPs are rebalanced monthly to restore equal weights\nto each security within the TBPs. We find that the risk and return profile of\nthe realized TBP represents a monotonically increasing frontier on the\nrisk-return plane, where the equally weighted portfolio (EWP) of all ten stocks\nplays a role in their lower bound. This shows the availability of TBPs in\ntargeting specific risk-return levels, and an EWP based on all the assets plays\na role in the reference portfolio of TBPs. In the process, thresholds play\ndominant roles in characterizing risk, return, and the prediction accuracy of\nthe subset. The TBP is more data-driven in designing portfolio target risk and\nreturn than existing ones, in the sense that it requires no prior knowledge of\nfinance such as financial assumptions, financial mathematics, or expert\ninsights. In a practical application, we present the TBP management procedure\nfor a time horizon extending over multiple time periods; we also discuss their\napplication to mean-variance portfolios to reduce estimation risk.\n",

What is the likelihood\nof having a successful market timing strategy? With an emphasis on modeling\nsimplicity, I calculate the feasible set of market timing portfolios using\nindex mutual fund data for perfectly timed (by hindsight) all or nothing\nquarterly switching between two asset classes, US stocks and bonds over the\ntime period 1993--2017. The historical optimal timing path of switches is shown\nto be indistinguishable from a random sequence. The key result is that the\nprobability distribution function of market timing returns is asymetric, that\nthe highest probability outcome for market timing is a below median return. Put\nanother way, simple math says market timing is more likely to lose than to\nwin---even before accounting for costs. The median of the market timing return\nprobability distribution can be directly calculated as a weighted average of\nthe returns of the model assets with the weights given by the fraction of time\neach asset has a higher return than the other. For the time period of the data\nthe median return was close to, but not identical with, the return of a static\n60:40 stock:bond portfolio. These results are illustrated through Monte Carlo\nsampling of timing paths within the feasible set and by the observed return\npaths of several market timing mutual funds.\n",

Instead, optimal lifecycle investment gives rise to so-called\nstochastic lifestyling (Cairns et al., 2006), whereby for low levels of\naccumulated capital it is optimal to invest fully in stocks and then gradually\nswitch to safer assets as the level of savings increases.

The proportion\ndeclines as the retiree becomes less risk averse for a while. However, for the\nleast risk averse retirees, a high proportion of their pension savings is\noptimally allocated to the tontine account.

We will use a\nneural network based predictor to predict the stock returns and measure the\nrisk of stocks based on the prediction errors in the neural network. We will\nperform a series of experiments on our portfolio optimization model with the\nreal data from Iran's stock market indices including Bank, Insurance,\nInvestment, Petroleum Products and Chemicals indices. Finally, 8 different\nportfolios with low, medium and high risks for different type of investors\n(risk-averse or risk taker) using genetic algorithm will be designed and\nanalyzed.\n",

When\nthe portfolio is built using noisy data, the expected value of the signal-noise\nratio is bounded from above via a Cramer-Rao bound, for the case of Gaussian\nreturns. The bound holds for `biased' estimators, thus there appears to be no\nbias-variance tradeoff for the problem of maximizing the signal-noise ratio. An\napproximate distribution of the signal-noise ratio for the Markowitz portfolio\nis given, and shown to be fairly accurate via Monte Carlo simulations, for\nGaussian returns as well as more exotic returns distributions. These findings\nimply that if the maximal population signal-noise ratio grows slower than the\nuniverse size to the 1/4 power, there may be no diversification benefit, rather\nexpected signal-noise ratio can decrease with additional assets. As a practical\nmatter, this may explain why the Markowitz portfolio is typically applied to\nsmall asset universes. Finally, the theorem is expanded to cover more general\nmodels of returns and trading schemes, including the conditional expectation\ncase where mean returns are linear in some observable features, subspace\nconstraints (i.e., dimensionality reduction), and hedging constraints.\n",

We focus on the impact of aging\non the optimal purchase of life annuities which form the basis of most Defined\nBenefit pension plans. Due to adverse selection, acquiring a lifetime payout\nannuity is an irreversible transaction that creates an incentive to delay.\nUnder the institutional all-or-nothing arrangement where annuitization must\ntake place at one distinct point in time (i.e. retirement), we derive the\noptimal age at which to annuitize and develop a metric to capture the loss from\nannuitizing prematurely. In contrast, under an open-market structure where\nindividuals can annuitize any fraction of their wealth at anytime, we locate a\ngeneral optimal annuity purchasing policy. In this case, we find that an\nindividual will initially annuitize a lump sum and then buy annuities to keep\nwealth to one side of a separating ray in wealth-annuity space.

This is a rather general pattern. The\nmodern portfolio theory of Markowitz [H. Markowitz, Portfolio Selection, 1959]\nand its natural generalization, the capital market pricing model, [W. F.\nSharpe, Mutual fund performance , 1966] are special cases of our general\nframework when the risk measure is taken to be the standard deviation and the\nutility function is the identity mapping. Using our general framework, we also\nrecover the results in [R. T. Rockafellar, S. Uryasev and M. Zabarankin, Master\nfunds in portfolio analysis with general deviation measures, 2006] that extends\nthe capital market pricing model to allow for the use of more general deviation\nmeasures. This generalized capital asset pricing model also applies to e.g.\nwhen an approximation of the maximum drawdown is considered as a risk measure.\nFurthermore, the consideration of a general utility function allows to go\nbeyond the \"additive\" performance measure to a \"multiplicative\" one of\ncumulative returns by using the log utility. As a result, the growth optimal\nportfolio theory [J. Lintner, The valuation of risk assets and the selection of\nrisky investments in stock portfolios and capital budgets, 1965] and the\nleverage space portfolio theory [R. Vince, The Leverage Space Trading Model,\n2009] can also be understood under our general framework. Thus, this general\nframework allows a unification of several important existing portfolio theories\nand goes much beyond.\n",

The no-short selling constraint acts as\nan asymmetric $\\ell_1$ regularizer, setting some of the portfolio weights to\nzero and keeping the out of sample estimator for the variance bounded, avoiding\nthe divergence present in the non-regularized case. However, the\nsusceptibility, i.e. the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio weights to\nchanges in the returns, diverges at a critical value $r=2$. This means that a\nban on short positions does not prevent the phase transition in the\noptimization problem, it merely shifts the critical point from its\nnon-regularized value of $r=1$ to $2$. At $r=2$ the out of sample estimator for\nthe portfolio variance stays finite and the estimated in-sample variance\nvanishes. We have performed numerical simulations to support the analytic\nresults and found perfect agreement for $N/T<2$. Numerical experiments on\nfinite size samples of symmetrically distributed returns show that above this\ncritical point the probability of finding solutions with zero in-sample\nvariance increases rapidly with increasing $N$, becoming one in the large $N$\nlimit. However, these are not legitimate solutions of the optimization problem,\nas they are infinitely sensitive to any change in the input parameters, in\nparticular they will wildly fluctuate from sample to sample.

And this trend is not going to stop with future generations,\nwho will live in a technology-driven and social media-based world. In the\ninvestment industry, robo-advisors face different challenges: client profiling,\ncustomization, asset pooling, liability constraints, etc. In its primary sense,\nrobo-advisory is a term for defining automated portfolio management. This\nincludes automated trading and rebalancing, but also automated portfolio\nallocation. And this last issue is certainly the most important challenge for\nrobo-advisory over the next five years. Today, in many robo-advisors, asset\nallocation is rather human-based and very far from being computer-based. The\nreason is that portfolio optimization is a very difficult task, and can lead to\noptimized mathematical solutions that are not optimal from a financial point of\nview (Michaud, 1989). The big challenge for robo-advisors is therefore to be\nable to optimize and rebalance hundreds of optimal portfolios without human\nintervention. In this paper, we show that the mean-variance optimization\napproach is mainly driven by arbitrage factors that are related to the concept\nof hedging portfolios. This is why regularization and sparsity are necessary to\ndefine robust asset allocation. However, this mathematical framework is more\ncomplex and requires understanding how norm penalties impacts portfolio\noptimization. From a numerical point of view, it also requires the\nimplementation of non-traditional algorithms based on ADMM methods.\n",

The optimal\nstrategy is of the \"bang-bang\" type similar to that obtained in [de Lataillade\net al., 2012]. When the risk aversion parameter is small, we find that the\ntrading threshold is an affine function of the instantaneous global position,\nwith a slope coefficient that we compute exactly. We relate the risk aversion\nparameter to the desired target risk and provide numerical simulations that\nsupport our analytical results.\n",

Many current\nstate-of-the-art approaches fall into the field of co-integration theory, where\nthe problem is phrased in terms of an eigenvector problem with sparsity\nconstraint. Although a number of approximate solutions have been proposed to\nsolve this NP-hard problem, all are based on relatively simple models and are\nlimited in their scalability. In this paper we leverage information obtained\nfrom a heterogeneous simultaneous graphical dynamic linear model (H-SGDLM) and\npropose a novel formulation of the mean reversion problem, which is phrased in\nterms of a quasi-convex minimisation with a normalisation constraint. This new\nformulation allows us to employ a cyclical coordinate descent algorithm for\nefficiently computing an exact sparse solution, even in a large universe of\nassets, while the use of H-SGDLM data allows us to easily control the required\nlevel of sparsity. We demonstrate the flexibility, speed and scalability of the\nproposed approach on S\\&P$500$, FX and ETF futures data.\n",

Since the population covariance matrix is not known, investors\nuse historical data to estimate it. Even though sample covariance matrix is an\nunbiased estimator of the population covariance matrix, it includes a great\namount of estimation error especially when the number of observed data is not\nmuch bigger than number of assets. As it is difficult to estimate the\ncovariance matrix with high dimensionality all at once, clustering stocks is\nproposed to come up with covariance matrix in two steps: firstly, within a\ncluster and secondly, between clusters. It decreases the estimation error by\nreducing the number of features in the data matrix. The motivation of this\ndissertation is that the estimation error can still remain high even after\nclustering, if a large amount of stocks is clustered together in a single\ngroup. This research proposes to utilize a bounded clustering method in order\nto limit the maximum cluster size. The result of experiments shows that not\nonly the gap between in-sample volatility and out-of-sample volatility\ndecreases, but also the out-of-sample volatility gets reduced. It implies that\nwe need a bounded clustering algorithm so that maximum clustering size can be\nprecisely controlled to find the best portfolio performance.\n",

For an investor observing both the return process and the discrete-time\nexpert opinions, we investigate in detail the asymptotic behavior of the filter\nas the frequency of the arrival of expert opinions tends to infinity. In our\nsetting, a higher frequency of expert opinions comes at the cost of accuracy,\nmeaning that as the frequency of expert opinions increases, the variance of\nexpert opinions becomes larger. We consider a model where information dates are\ndeterministic and equidistant and another model where the information dates\narrive randomly as the jump times of a Poisson process. In both cases we derive\nlimit theorems stating that the information obtained from observing the\ndiscrete-time expert opinions is asymptotically the same as that from observing\na certain diffusion process which can be interpreted as a continuous-time\nexpert.\n  We use our limit theorems to derive so-called diffusion approximations of the\nfilter for high-frequency discrete-time expert opinions.

The\nproblem is first set in a control-theoretic framework, and then, the main\nquestion we address is as follows: In the absence of transaction costs, does\nhigh-frequency trading always lead to the best performance? Related to this is\nour prior work on betting, also in the Kelly context, which examines the impact\nof making a wager and letting it ride. Our results on betting frequency can be\ninterpreted in the context of weight selection for a two-asset portfolio\nconsisting of one risky asset and one riskless asset. With regard to the\nquestion above, our prior results indicate that it is often the case that there\nare no performance benefits associated with high-frequency trading. In the\npresent paper, we generalize the analysis to portfolios with multiple risky\nassets. We show that if there is an asset satisfying a new condition which we\ncall dominance, then an optimal portfolio consists of this asset alone; i.e.,\nthe trader has \"all eggs in one basket\" and performance becomes a constant\nfunction of rebalancing frequency. Said another way, the problem of rebalancing\nis rendered moot.

A\nspecial attention is given to several realisations of a so called balanced\nportfolio, which is rooted in the natural \"buy-low-sell-high\" principle.\nResults show that there is no universal strategy, because they perform\ndifferently in different circumstances (e.g. for varying transaction costs).\nMoreover, the planned time of investment may also have a significant impact on\nthe profitability of certain strategies. All methods have been tested with both\nsimulated trajectories and real data from the Polish stock market.\n",

By constructing an auxiliary\nstochastic process, we obtain the optimal investment strategy, which depends on\nthe solution to a Riccati-Volterra equation.

However, the\nexternal price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as\ndomestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging\nstrategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this\nrisk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk\nMeter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior\nembedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil,\nRussia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the\nfinancial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in\naddition to the Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM\nsovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned\ncountries currencies. The results indicated that the FRM of EMs FIs reached its\nmaximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the\nMacro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We\nthen study the relationship between those factors and the tail event network\nbehavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors to choose\nthe suitable market for in-vestment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For\nthat purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies\nand FRM network centrality is developed.

        "summary": "  Over the past half-century, the empirical finance community has produced vast\nliterature on the advantages of the equally weighted S\\&P 500 portfolio as well\nas the often overlooked disadvantages of the market capitalization weighted\nStandard and Poor's (S\\&P 500) portfolio (see \\cite{Bloom}, \\cite{Uppal},\n\\cite{Jacobs}, \\cite{Treynor}). However, portfolio allocation based on Tukey's\ntransformational ladde have, rather surprisingly, remained absent from the\nliterature. In this work, we consider the S\\&P 500 portfolio over the 1958-2015\ntime horizon weighted by Tukey's transformational ladder (\\cite{Tukey2}):\n$1/x^2,\\,\\, 1/x,\\,\\, 1/\\sqrt{x},\\,\\, \\text{log}(x),\\,\\, \\sqrt{x},\\,\\, x,\\,\\,\n\\text{and} \\,\\, x^2$, where $x$ is defined as the market capitalization\nweighted S\\&P 500 portfolio. Accounting for dividends and transaction fees, we\nfind that the 1/$x^2$ weighting strategy produces cumulative returns that\nsignificantly dominates all other portfolios, achieving a compound annual\ngrowth rate of 18\\% over the 1958-2015 horizon. Our story is furthered by a\nstartling phenomenon: both the cumulative and annual returns of the $1/x^2$\nweighting strategy are superior to those of the $1/x$ weighting strategy, which\nare in turn superior to those of the 1/$\\sqrt{x}$ weighted portfolio, and so\nforth, ending with the $x^2$ transformation, whose cumulative returns are the\nlowest of the seven transformations of Tukey's transformational ladder. The\norder of cumulative returns precisely follows that of Tukey's transformational\nladder. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discover this\nphenomenon.\n",

In this article we detail the\nconstruction of a monthly reweighted portfolio involving two independent smart\nbeta strategies; the first component is a long-short beta-neutral strategy\nderived from running an adaptive boosting classifier on a suite of momentum\nindicators. The second component is a minimized volatility portfolio which\nexploits the observation that low-volatility stocks tend to yield higher\nrisk-adjusted returns than high-volatility stocks.

Several\ncommodities compete as substitutable energy sources and energy diversifiers.\nSuch competition reduces the energy vulnerability of countries as well as\nportfolios' risk exposure. Vulnerability results mainly from price trends and\nfluctuations, following supply and demand shocks. Such energy price uncertainty\nattracts many market participants in the energy commodity markets. First,\nenergy producers and consumers hedge adverse price changes with energy\nderivatives. Second, financial market participants use commodities and\ncommodity derivatives to diversify their conventional portfolios.

The portfolio\noptimization problem is naturally modeled as a mean-risk bi-criteria\noptimization problem where the mean rate of return of the portfolio must be\nmaximized whereas a given risk measure must be minimized. Several mathematical\nprogramming models and techniques have been presented in the literature in\norder to efficiently solve the portfolio problem. A relatively recent promising\nline of research is to exploit clustering information of an assets network in\norder to develop new portfolio optimization paradigms. In this paper we endow\nthe assets network with a metric based on correlation coefficients between\nassets' returns, and show how classical location problems on networks can be\nused for clustering assets. In particular, by adding a new criterion to the\nportfolio selection problem based on an objective function of a classical\nlocation problem, we are able to measure the effect of clustering on the\nselected assets with respect to the non-selected ones. Most papers dealing with\nclustering and portfolio selection models solve these problems in two distinct\nsteps: cluster first and then selection. The innovative contribution of this\npaper is that we propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation for\ndealing with this problem in a unified phase.

The\nframework derives the forward looking distribution by applying unequal time and\nstate conditioned probabilities to historical observations of asset class\nreturns. This is achieved using relative entropy to find estimates with the\nleast distortion to the prior distribution. Here, we use the HS-FP framework on\nSouth African financial market data for asset allocation purposes; by\nestimating expected returns, correlations and volatilities that are better\nrepresented through the measured market cycle. We demonstrated a range of state\nvariables that can be useful towards understanding market environments.\nConcretely, we compare the out-of-sample performance for a specific\nconfiguration of the HS-FP model relative to classic Mean Variance\nOptimization(MVO) and Equally Weighted (EW) benchmark models. The framework\ndisplays low probability of backtest overfitting and the out-of-sample net\nreturns and Sharpe ratio point estimates of the HS-FP model outperforms the\nbenchmark models. However, the results are inconsistent when training windows\nare varied, the Sharpe ratio is seen to be inflated, and the method does not\ndemonstrate statistically significant out-performance on a gross and net basis.\n",

Such problem mainly concerns the expectation\nand variability of return (i.e., mean and variance). Although the variance\nwould be the most fundamental risk measure to be minimized, it has several\ndrawbacks. Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a relatively new risk measure\nthat addresses some of the shortcomings of well-known variance-related risk\nmeasures, and because of its computational efficiencies, it has gained\npopularity. CVaR is defined as the expected value of the loss that occurs\nbeyond a certain probability level ($\\beta$).

We confirm even small changes in $\\beta$ can result in huge\nchanges in the whole portfolio structure. In order to improve this problem, we\npropose RM-CVaR: Regularized Multiple $\\beta$-CVaR Portfolio.

In this paper, we attempt to incorporate it by employing principal\ncomponent analysis to filter out dominant financial ratios from each sector and\nthereafter, use the portfolio optimization model incorporating second-order\nstochastic dominance criteria to derive an optimal investment. We consider a\ntotal of $11$ financial ratios corresponding to each sector representing four\ncategories of ratios, namely liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation.\nPCA is then applied over a period of 10 years to extract dominant ratios from\neach sector in two ways, one from the component solution and the other from\neach category on the basis of their communalities. The two-step Sectoral\nPortfolio Optimization (SPO) model is then utilized to build an optimal\nportfolio. The strategy formed using the formerly extracted ratios is termed\nPCA-SPO(A) and the latter PCA-SPO(B). The results obtained from the proposed\nstrategies are compared with those from mean-variance, minimum variance, SPO,\nand nominal SSD models, with and without financial ratios. The empirical\nperformance of proposed strategies is analyzed in two ways, viz., using a\nrolling window scheme and using market trend scenarios for S\\&P BSE 500 (India)\nand S\\&P 500 (U.S.) markets.

It appears that the median liquidity pool had a net nil ROI when\ntaking Impermanent Losses into account.

Prices of risky assets\nvary rapidly and randomly due to the complexity of finance market. Random\ninterval is a good tool to describe uncertainty with both randomness and\nimprecision. Considering the uncertainty of financial market, we employ random\nintervals to describe the returns of a risk asset and consider the tail risk,\nwhich is called the interval-valued Conditional Value at Risk (ICVaR, for\nshort). Such an ICVaR is a risk measure and satisfies subadditivity. Under the\nnew risk measure ICVaR, as a manner similar to the classical portfolio model of\nMarkowitz, optimal interval-valued portfolio selection models are built.

The sensitivity matrix measures the similarity of the\nprojections of portfolio constituents on a vector space formed by common\ndrivers' returns and is used to optimize for diversification on both\nidiosyncratic and systematic risks while adding directionality and future\nbehavior information via returns dynamics.

To this end, we develop an\ninnovative statistical methodology, based on a benchmark-asset principal\ncomponent factorization, to determine a tracking portfolio that replicates the\nperformance of a benchmark by investing in a subset of the investable universe.\nThis strategy, named hybrid Principal Component Analysis (hPCA), is applied\nboth on normal and skew distributions.

However, many existing models\noperate at the aggregate portfolio level and thus fail to capture the complex\ncross-dependencies between portfolio components. To address this, a new\napproach is presented that uses vine copulas in combination with univariate\nARMA-GARCH models for marginal modelling to compute conditional portfolio-level\nrisk measure estimates by simulating portfolio-level forecasts conditioned on a\nstress factor. A quantile-based approach is then presented to observe the\nbehaviour of risk measures given a particular state of the conditioning\nasset(s). In a case study of Spanish equities with different stress factors,\nthe results show that the portfolio is quite robust to a sharp downturn in the\nAmerican market. At the same time, there is no evidence of this behaviour with\nrespect to the European market.\n",

The optimization of stock\nportfolios is a particularly hard problem since the stock prices are volatile\nand estimation of their future volatilities and values, in most cases, is very\ndifficult, if not impossible. This work uses three ratios, the Sharpe ratio,\nthe Sortino ratio, and the Calmar ratio, for designing the mean-variance\noptimized portfolios for six important sectors listed in the National Stock\nExchange (NSE) of India. Three portfolios are designed for each sector\nmaximizing the ratios based on the historical prices of the ten most important\nstocks of each sector from Jan 1, 2017, to Dec 31, 2020. The evaluation of the\nportfolios is done based on their cumulative returns over the test period from\nJan 1, 2021, to Dec 31, 2021. The ratio that yields the maximum cumulative\nreturns for both the training and the test periods for the majority of the\nsectors is identified. The sectors that exhibit the maximum cumulative returns\nfor the same ratio are also identified. The results provide useful insights for\ninvestors in the stock market in making their investment decisions based on the\ncurrent return and risks associated with the six sectors and their stocks.\n",

We then discuss the work of\nSchuhmacher et al. (2021). Although their theoretical findings deduce that the\nMean-Variance Analysis remains valid under Skew-Elliptical distributions, we\nargue that this does not entail that the MVC coincides with the SSDR. In fact,\ngenerating multiple MV-pairs that follow a Skew-Normal distribution it becomes\nevident that the MVC fails to coincide with the SSDR for some types of\nrisk-averse investors. In the second part of this work, we examine the premise\nof Levy and Markowitz (1979) that \"the MVC deduces the maximization of the\nexpected utility of an investor, under any approximately quadratic utility\nfunction, without making any further assumption on the distribution of the\nlotteries\".

The pension manager invests in the financial market with three\nassets: cash, bond and stock.

The optimization goal of the manager is to maximize the\nexpected utility in the overfunded region minus the weighted solvency risk in\nthe underfunded region. By introducing an auxiliary process and related\nequivalent optimization problems and using the martingale method, the optimal\nwealth process, optimal portfolio and efficient frontier are obtained under\nfour cases (high tolerance towards solvency risk, low tolerance towards\nsolvency risk, a specific lower bound, and high lower bound).

The investor assumes a\nprior drift distribution and is able to learn by observing the asset prize\nrealizations during the investment horizon. While the solution of an expected\nutility maximizing investor with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) is well\nknown, we consider the optimization problem under risk and ambiguity\npreferences by means of the KMM (Klibanoff et al.

Assuming also a CRRA type ambiguity function, it turns out that\nthe optimal strategy can be stated in terms of the solution without ambiguity\npreferences but an adjusted drift distribution. To the best of our knowledge an\nexplicit solution method in this setting is new. We rely on some duality\ntheorems to prove our statements.\n  Based on our theoretical results, we are able to shed light on the impact of\nthe prior drift distribution as well as the consequences of ambiguity\npreferences via the transfer to an adjusted drift distribution, i.e. we are\nable to explain the interaction of risk and ambiguity preferences. We compare\nour results with the ones in a pre-commitment setup where the investor is\nrestricted to deterministic strategies. It turns out that (under risk and\nambiguity aversion) an infinite investment horizon implies in both cases a\nmaximin decision rule, i.e. the investor follows the worst (best) Merton\nfraction (over all realizations of it) if she is more (less) risk averse than a\nlog-investor.

We derive portfolio allocation rules\nfor asymmetric Laplace distributed $ALD(\\mu,\\sigma,\\kappa)$ returns and compare\nthem with the mean-variance approach, which is based on Gaussian returns. We\nreveal that in the limit of small $\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$, the Markowitz\ncontribution is accompanied by a skewness term. We also obtain the allocation\nrules when the expected return is a random normal variable in an average and\nworst-case scenarios, which allows us to take into account uncertainty of the\npredicted returns. An optimal worst-case scenario solution smoothly\napproximates between equal weights and minimum variance portfolio, presenting\nan attractive convex alternative to the risk parity portfolio. We address the\nissue of handling singular covariance matrices by imposing conditional\nindependence structure on the precision matrix directly. Finally, utilizing a\nmicroscopic portfolio model with random drift and analytical expression for the\nexpected utility function with log-normal distributed cross-sectional returns,\nwe demonstrate the influence of model parameters on portfolio construction.\nThis comprehensive approach enhances allocation weight stability, mitigates\ninstabilities associated with the mean-variance approach, and can prove\nvaluable for both short-term traders and long-term investors.\n",

Our package offers\nanother advantage that is usually neglected in the literature, which is the\nnumber of assets that should be included in the portfolio. The common practice\nis to assume that the number of assets is given exogenously when the portfolio\nis constructed. However, the current software component constructs all possible\ncombinations and thus the investor can figure out empirically which portfolio\nis the best one among all portfolios considered. The software is consumer\nfriendly via a graphical user interface. An application is also provided to\ndemonstrate how the software can be used using real-time series data for\nseveral assets.\n",

The\nsimplicity of SmartDCA allows for rigorous mathematical analysis, enabling us\nto establish its superiority through the application of Cauchy-Schwartz\ninequality and Lehmer means. We further extend our analysis to what we refer to\nas $\\rho$-SmartDCA, where the invested amount is raised to the power of $\\rho$.\nWe demonstrate that higher values of $\\rho$ lead to enhanced performance.\nHowever, this approach may result in unbounded investments. To address this\nconcern, we introduce a bounded version of SmartDCA, taking advantage of two\nnovel mean definitions that we name quasi-Lehmer means.

To support our claims,\nwe provide rigorous mathematical proofs and conduct numerical analyses across\nvarious scenarios.

        "summary": "  Statistical arbitrage methods identify mispricings in securities with the\ngoal of building portfolios which are weakly correlated with the market. In\npairs trading, an arbitrage opportunity is identified by observing relative\nprice movements between a pair of two securities. By simultaneously observing\nmultiple pairs, one can exploit different arbitrage opportunities and increase\nthe performance of such methods. However, the use of a large number of pairs is\ndifficult due to the increased probability of contradictory trade signals among\ndifferent pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel portfolio construction\nmethod based on preference relation graphs, which can reconcile contradictory\npairs trading signals across multiple security pairs. The proposed approach\nenables joint exploitation of arbitrage opportunities among a large number of\nsecurities. Experimental results using three decades of historical returns of\nroughly 500 stocks from the S\\&P 500 index show that the portfolios based on\npreference relations exhibit robust returns even with high transaction costs,\nand that their performance improves with the number of securities considered.\n",

Several formulations of this problem under various model\nsettings have been studied under the Mean-Variance (MV) principle perspective.\nIn this paper, the ALM problem is revisited under the context of model\nuncertainty in the one-stage framework. In practice, uncertainty issues appear\nto several aspects of the problem, e.g. liability process characteristics,\nmarket conditions, inflation rates, inside information effects, etc. A\nframework relying on the notion of the Wasserstein barycenter is presented\nwhich is able to treat robustly this type of ambiguities by appropriate\nhandling the various information sources (models) and appropriately\nreformulating the relevant decision making problem. The proposed framework can\nbe applied to a number of different model settings leading to the selection of\ninvestment portfolios that remain robust to the various uncertainties appearing\nin the market. The paper is concluded with a numerical experiment for a static\nversion of the ALM problem, employing standard modelling approaches,\nillustrating the capabilities of the proposed method with very satisfactory\nresults in retrieving the true optimal strategy even in high noise cases.\n",

Then, we would apply several weight\nallocation methods to those factors, including two fixed weight allocation\nmethods, three optimisation methods, and a Black-Litterman model. In addition,\nwe would also fit a Deep Learning model for generating views periodically and\nincorporating views with the prior to achieve dynamically updated weights by\nusing the Black-Litterman model. In the end, the robustness checking shows how\nweights change with respect to time evolving and variance increasing. Results\nusing shrinkage variance are provided to alleviate the impacts of\nrepresentativeness of historical data, but there sadly has little impact.\nOverall, the model by using the Deep Learning plus Black-Litterman model\nresults outperform the portfolio by other weight allocation schemes, even\nthough further improvement and robustness checking should be performed.\n",

As a result, practitioners and scholars have explored\nalternative methods that prioritize risk management and diversification. One\nsuch approach is Risk Budgeting, where portfolio risk is allocated among assets\naccording to predefined risk budgets. The effectiveness of Risk Budgeting in\nachieving true diversification can, however, be questioned, given that asset\nreturns are often influenced by a small number of risk factors. From this\nperspective, one question arises: is it possible to allocate risk at the factor\nlevel using the Risk Budgeting approach?

While these approximations are\neffective for large investment budgets, they deteriorate as budgets decrease.\nTo alleviate this issue, a discrete Markowitz portfolio theory (DMPT) with\nfinite budgets and integer stock weights can be formulated, but results in a\nnon-polynomial (NP)-hard problem. Recent progress in quantum processing units\n(QPUs), including quantum annealers, makes solving DMPT problems feasible. Our\nstudy explores portfolio optimization on quantum annealers, establishing a\nmapping between continuous and discrete Markowitz portfolio theories. We find\nthat correctly normalized discrete portfolios converge to continuous solutions\nas budgets increase. Our DMPT implementation provides efficient frontier\nsolutions, outperforming traditional rounding methods, even for moderate\nbudgets. Responding to the demand for environmentally and socially responsible\ninvestments, we enhance our discrete portfolio optimization with ESG\n(environmental, social, governance) ratings for EURO STOXX 50 index stocks. We\nintroduce a utility function incorporating ESG ratings to balance risk, return,\nand ESG-friendliness, and discuss implications for ESG-aware investors.\n",

        "summary": "  Traditionally, assets are selected for inclusion in a portfolio (long or\nshort) by human analysts. Teams of human portfolio managers (PMs) seek to weigh\nand balance these securities using optimisation methods and other portfolio\nconstruction processes. Often, human PMs consider human analyst recommendations\nagainst the backdrop of the analyst's recommendation track record and the\napplicability of the analyst to the recommendation they provide. Many firms\nregularly ask analysts to provide a \"conviction\" level on their\nrecommendations. In the eyes of PMs, understanding a human analyst's track\nrecord has typically come down to basic spread sheet tabulation or, at best, a\n\"virtual portfolio\" paper trading book to keep track of results of\nrecommendations.\n  Analysts' conviction around their recommendations and their \"paper trading\"\ntrack record are two crucial workflow components between analysts and portfolio\nconstruction. Many human PMs may not even appreciate that they factor these\ndata points into their decision-making logic. This chapter explores how\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to replicate these two steps and\nbridge the gap between AI data analytics and AI-based portfolio construction\nmethods. This field of AI is referred to as Recommender Systems (RS). This\nchapter will further explore what metadata that RS systems functionally supply\nto downstream systems and their features.\n",

The new\nprice process is an affine factor model with the conditional log-price process\nplaying the role of a vector of factors.

Unlike traditional approaches that focus on\nbroad economic regimes affecting the entire asset universe, our framework\nleverages both unsupervised and supervised learning to generate tailored regime\nforecasts for individual assets. Initially, we use the statistical jump model,\na robust unsupervised regime identification model, to derive regime labels for\nhistorical periods, classifying them into bullish or bearish states based on\nfeatures extracted from an asset return series. Following this, a supervised\ngradient-boosted decision tree classifier is trained to predict these regimes\nusing a combination of asset-specific return features and cross-asset\nmacro-features. We apply this framework individually to each asset in our\nuniverse. Subsequently, return and risk forecasts which incorporate these\nregime predictions are input into Markowitz mean-variance optimization to\ndetermine optimal asset allocation weights. We demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach through an empirical study on a multi-asset portfolio comprising\ntwelve risky assets, including global equity, bond, real estate, and commodity\nindexes spanning from 1991 to 2023. The results consistently show\noutperformance across various portfolio models, including minimum-variance,\nmean-variance, and naive-diversified portfolios, highlighting the advantages of\nintegrating asset-specific regime forecasts into dynamic asset allocation.\n",

Previously,\nwe introduced the Multi-Industry Simplex (MIS), a probabilistic extension of\nGICS that utilizes topic modeling, a natural language processing approach.\nAlthough our initial version, MIS-1, was able to improve upon GICS by providing\nmulti-industry representations, it relied on an overly simple architecture that\nrequired prior knowledge about the number of industries and relied on the\nunrealistic assumption that industries are uncorrelated and independent over\ntime. We improve upon this model with MIS-2, which addresses three key\nlimitations of MIS-1 : we utilize Bayesian Non-Parametrics to automatically\ninfer the number of industries from data, we employ Markov Updating to account\nfor industries that change over time, and we adjust for correlated and\nhierarchical industries allowing for both broad and niche industries (similar\nto GICS). Further, we provide an out-of-sample test directly comparing MIS-2\nand GICS on the basis of future correlation prediction, where we find evidence\nthat MIS-2 provides a measurable improvement over GICS. MIS-2 provides\nportfolio managers with a more robust tool for industry classification,\nempowering them to more effectively identify and manage risk, particularly\naround multi-sector conglomerates in a rapidly evolving market in which new\nindustries periodically emerge.\n",

A empirical analysis of the recent\nhistory of the returns of S&P 500 Index members is presented and compared to\nthe expectations from both this model and linear factor models. This analysis\nsupports the isotropic covariance model and does not seem to provide evidence\nin support of linear factor models. Analysis of portfolio selection under\nisotropic correlation is presented using mean-variance optimization for both\nheteroskedastic and homoskedastic cases. Portfolio selection for negative\nexponential utility maximizers is also discussed for the general case of\ndistributions of returns with elliptical symmetry. The fact that idiosyncratic\nrisk may not be removed by diversification in a model that the data supports\nundermines the basic premises of structures such as the C.A.P.M. and A.P.T.

In view of the traditional portfolio model could\nnot adapt to the actual capital market and can provide erroneous results. This\npaper innovatively constructs a mean-detrended cross-correlation portfolio\nmodel (M-DCCP model), This model is designed to embed detrended\ncross-correlation between different simultaneously recorded time series in the\npresence of nonstationary into the reward-risk criterion. We illustrate the\nmodel's effectiveness by selected five composite indexes (SSE 50, CSI 300, SSE\n500, CSI 1000 and CSI 2000) in China A-share market. The empirical results show\nthat compared with traditional mean-variance portfolio model (M-VP model), the\nM-DCCP model is more conducive for investors to construct optimal portfolios\nunder the different fluctuation exponent preference and time scales preference,\nso as to improve portfolio's performance.\n",

We find\nthat there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the extreme Sharpe ratios\nobserved are beyond what one would expect by chance, given the number of teams,\nand thus not necessarily indicative of the possibility of consistently\nattaining abnormal returns. Furthermore, we introduce a stylized model of the\ncompetition to derive and analyze a portfolio strategy optimized for attaining\nthe top rank. The results demonstrate that the task of achieving the top rank\nis not necessarily identical to that of attaining the best investment returns\nin expectation. It is possible to improve one's chances of winning, even\nwithout the ability to attain abnormal returns, by choosing portfolio weights\nadversarially based on the current competition ranking. Empirical analysis of\nsubmitted portfolio weights aligns with this finding.\n",

Diversity in learning\namong predictors is parametrically controlled, and their predictions form a\nstructured input for the ensemble optimization model. The proposed methodology\nestablishes a link between this source of learning diversity and portfolio risk\ndiversification, enabling parametric control of portfolio diversification prior\nto the decision-making process. Moreover, the methodology demonstrates that the\ndiversity in asset or hypothesis selection, based on predictions of future\nreturns, before and independently of the ensemble learning stage, also\ncontributes to the out-of-sample portfolio diversification.

Due to the operational constraint that\nmost professional databases do not track the change of constitution of\nbenchmark portfolios, standard tests of performance suffer from the \"look-ahead\nbenchmark bias,\" when they use the assets constituting the benchmarks of\nreference at the end of the testing period, rather than at the beginning of the\nperiod. Here, we report that the \"look-ahead benchmark bias\" can exhibit a\nsurprisingly large amplitude for portfolios of common stocks (up to 8% annum\nfor the S&P500 taken as the benchmark) -- while most studies have emphasized\nrelated survival biases in performance of mutual and hedge funds for which the\nbiases can be expected to be even larger. We use the CRSP database from 1926 to\n2006 and analyze the running top 500 US capitalizations to demonstrate that\nthis bias can account for a gross overestimation of performance metrics such as\nthe Sharpe ratio as well as an underestimation of risk, as measured for\ninstance by peak-to-valley drawdowns. We demonstrate the presence of a\nsignificant bias in the estimation of the survival and look-ahead biases\nstudied in the literature. A general methodology to test the properties of\ninvestment strategies is advanced in terms of random strategies with similar\ninvestment constraints.\n",

In this\npaper, we approach the problem from the point of view of statistical learning\ntheory. The occurrence of the instability is intimately related to over-fitting\nwhich can be avoided using known regularization methods. We show how\nregularized portfolio optimization with the expected shortfall as a risk\nmeasure is related to support vector regression. The budget constraint dictates\na modification. We present the resulting optimization problem and discuss the\nsolution. The L2 norm of the weight vector is used as a regularizer, which\ncorresponds to a diversification \"pressure\". This means that diversification,\nbesides counteracting downward fluctuations in some assets by upward\nfluctuations in others, is also crucial because it improves the stability of\nthe solution. The approach we provide here allows for the simultaneous\ntreatment of optimization and diversification in one framework that enables the\ninvestor to trade-off between the two, depending on the size of the available\ndata set.\n",

We study the regularity of the optimal\nvalue function. We show that the optimal dividend payment strategy has a band\nstructure. We find a method to construct a candidate solution and obtain a\nverification result to check optimality. Finally, we give an example where the\noptimal dividend strategy is not barrier and the optimal value function is not\ntwice continuously differentiable.\n",

To achieve the optimal growth, we use threshold\nportfolios, where we introduce a recursive update to calculate the expected\nwealth. We then demonstrate that under the threshold rebalancing framework, the\nachievable set of portfolios elegantly form an irreducible Markov chain under\nmild technical conditions. We evaluate the corresponding stationary\ndistribution of this Markov chain, which provides a natural and efficient\nmethod to calculate the cumulative expected wealth. Subsequently, the\ncorresponding parameters are optimized yielding the growth optimal portfolio\nunder proportional transaction costs in i.i.d. discrete-time two-asset markets.\nAs a widely known financial problem, we next solve optimal portfolio selection\nin discrete-time markets constructed by sampling continuous-time Brownian\nmarkets. For the case that the underlying discrete distributions of the price\nrelative vectors are unknown, we provide a maximum likelihood estimator that is\nalso incorporated in the optimization framework in our simulations.\n",

We first prove existence of a solution\nfor convex constraints by showing that the space of constrained terminal gains,\nwhich is a space of stochastic integrals, is closed in L^2. Then we use\nstochastic control methods to describe the local structure of the optimal\nstrategy, as follows. The value process of a naturally associated constrained\nlinear-quadratic optimal control problem is decomposed into a sum with two\nopportunity processes L^{\\pm} appearing as coefficients. The martingale\noptimality principle translates into a drift condition for the semimartingale\ncharacteristics of L^{\\pm} or equivalently into a coupled system of backward\nstochastic differential equations for L^{\\pm}. We show how this can be used to\nboth characterise and construct optimal strategies. Our results explain and\ngeneralise all the results available in the literature so far.

Specifically, we show that the critical\nassumption used in Jarrow (2010, pg. 20), to derive the illusionary alpha\nresult, is based on a zero set for CAPM with Lebesgue measure zero. So\nconclusions based on that assumption may well have probability measure zero of\noccurrence as well. Technically, the existence of [Tanaka] local time on a zero\nset for CAPM implies existence of positive alphas. In fact, we show that\npositive alpha exists under the same scenarios of \"perpetual event swap\" and\n\"market systemic event\" Jarrow (2010) used to formulate the illusionary\npositive alpha result. First, we prove that as long as asset price volatility\nis greater than zero, systemic events like market crash will occur in finite\ntime almost surely. Thus creating an opportunity to hedge against that event.\nSecond, we find that Jarrow's \"false positive alpha\" variable constitutes\nportfolio manager reward for trading strategy. For instance, we show that\npositive alpha exists if portfolio managers develop hedging strategies based on\neither (1) an exotic [barrier] option on the underlying asset - with barrier\nhitting time motivated by the \"market systemic\" event, or (2) a swaption\nstrategy for the implied interest rate risk inherent in Jarrow's triumvirate of\nriskless rate of return, factor sensitivity exposure, and constant risk premium\nfor a perpetual event swap.\n",

In particular, we use an asymmetric dynamic conditional\ncorrelation (ADCC) model to estimate the time-varying correlations of financial\nreturns where the individual volatilities are driven by GJR-GARCH models. The\nADCC-GJR-GARCH model takes into consideration the asymmetries in individual\nassets' volatilities, as well as in the correlations. The errors are modeled\nusing a Dirichlet location-scale mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions\nallowing for a great flexibility in the return distribution in terms of\nskewness and kurtosis. Model estimation and prediction are developed using MCMC\nmethods based on slice sampling techniques. We carry out a simulation study to\nillustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach. We find that the proposed\nDPM model is able to adapt to several frequently used distribution models and\nalso accurately estimates the posterior distribution of the volatilities of the\nreturns, without assuming any underlying distribution. Finally, we present a\nfinancial application using Apple and NASDAQ Industrial index data to solve a\nportfolio allocation problem. We find that imposing a restrictive parametric\ndistribution can result into underestimation of the portfolio variance, whereas\nDPM model is able to overcome this problem.\n",

We propose a novel approach to\nportfolio diversification using the information of searched items on Google\nTrends. The diversification is based on an idea that popularity of a stock\nmeasured by search queries is correlated with the stock riskiness. We penalize\nthe popular stocks by assigning them lower portfolio weights and we bring\nforward the less popular, or peripheral, stocks to decrease the total riskiness\nof the portfolio. Our results indicate that such strategy dominates both the\nbenchmark index and the uniformly weighted portfolio both in-sample and\nout-of-sample.\n",

The presence of negative alpha weights, which are allowed when\nalpha streams are traded on the same execution platform, complicates the\noptimization problem. By using factor model approach to alpha covariance\nmatrix, the original optimization problem can be viewed as a 1-dimensional root\nsearching problem plus an optimization problem that requires a finite number of\niterations. We discuss this approach without costs and with linear costs, and\nalso with nonlinear costs in a certain approximation, which makes the\nallocation problem tractable without forgoing nonlinear portfolio capacity\nbound effects.\n",

This is a well known\nfinancial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is\nuninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one\nwould not expect profits from such strategies. That is, according to uncovered\ninterest rate parity (UIP), changes in the related exchange rates should offset\nthe potential to profit from such interest rate differentials. However, it has\nbeen shown empirically, that investors can earn profits on average by borrowing\nin a country with a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and\ninvesting in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, whilst allowing for\nany losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. This\npaper explores the financial risk that trading strategies seeking to exploit a\nviolation of the UIP condition are exposed to with respect to multivariate tail\ndependence present in both the funding and investment currency baskets. It will\noutline in what contexts these portfolio risk exposures will benefit\naccumulated portfolio returns and under what conditions such tail exposures\nwill reduce portfolio returns.\n",

We then describe a multi-period version of the trading method, where\noptimization is used to plan a sequence of trades, with only the first one\nexecuted, using estimates of future quantities that are unknown when the trades\nare chosen. The single-period method traces back to Markowitz; the multi-period\nmethods trace back to model predictive control. Our contribution is to describe\nthe single-period and multi-period methods in one simple framework, giving a\nclear description of the development and the approximations made. In this paper\nwe do not address a critical component in a trading algorithm, the predictions\nor forecasts of future quantities. The methods we describe in this paper can be\nthought of as good ways to exploit predictions, no matter how they are made. We\nhave also developed a companion open-source software library that implements\nmany of the ideas and methods described in the paper.\n",

Multi-currency portfolio is an alternative to\nachieve higher returns and more diversified portfolios but it requires a\ncareful management of the entailed risks from changes in exchange rates.\n  The deviation between asset and currency exposures in a portfolio is defined\nas the \"currency overlay\". This paper addresses risk mitigation by allowing\ncurrency overlay and asset allocation be optimised together. We propose a model\nof the international portfolio optimisation problem in which the currency\noverlay is constructed by holding foreign exchange rate forward contracts.\nCrucially, the cost of carry, transaction costs, and margin requirement of\nforward contracts are also taken into account in portfolio return calculation.\nThis novel extension of previous overlay models improves the accuracy of risk\nand return calculation of portfolios; furthermore, our experimental results\nshow that inclusion of such costs significantly changes the optimal decisions.\nEffects of constraints imposed to reduce transaction costs associated are\nexamined and the empirical results show that risk-return compensation of\nportfolios varies significantly with different return targets.\n",

Most often, the parameters of interest are the population mean vector\nand the population covariance matrix of the asset return distribution.

This approach possesses\nseveral advantages, {e.g.} (i) it determines the sampling distribution of the\nestimated optimal portfolio weights by expressions, which could be used to draw\nsamples from this distribution efficiently; (ii) the application of the derived\nstochastic representation provides an easy way to obtain the asymptotic\napproximation of the sampling distribution. The later property is used to show\nthat the high-dimensional asymptotic distribution of optimal portfolio weights\nis a multivariate normal and to determine its parameters. Moreover, a\nconsistent estimator of optimal portfolio weights and their characteristics is\nderived under the high-dimensional settings.

However, it also has one well-established\nfailing since it can lead to portfolios that are not optimal from a financial\npoint of view. Nevertheless, very few models have succeeded in providing a real\nalternative solution to the Markowitz model. The main reason lies in the fact\nthat most academic portfolio optimization models are intractable in real life\nalthough they present solid theoretical properties. By intractable we mean that\nthey can be implemented for an investment universe with a small number of\nassets using a lot of computational resources and skills, but they are unable\nto manage a universe with dozens or hundreds of assets. However, the emergence\nand the rapid development of robo-advisors means that we need to rethink\nportfolio optimization and go beyond the traditional mean-variance optimization\napproach. Another industry has faced similar issues concerning large-scale\noptimization problems. Machine learning has long been associated with linear\nand logistic regression models. Again, the reason was the inability of\noptimization algorithms to solve high-dimensional industrial problems.\nNevertheless, the end of the 1990s marked an important turning point with the\ndevelopment and the rediscovery of several methods that have since produced\nimpressive results. The goal of this paper is to show how portfolio allocation\ncan benefit from the development of these large-scale optimization algorithms.\nNot all of these algorithms are useful in our case, but four of them are\nessential when solving complex portfolio optimization problems. These four\nalgorithms are the coordinate descent, the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers, the proximal gradient method and the Dykstra's algorithm.\n",

Rather than base the dual domain on (local)\nmartingale deflators, we use a class of supermartingale deflators such that\ndeflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a supermartingale for\nall admissible consumption plans. This yields a strong duality, because the\nenlarged dual domain of processes dominated by deflators is naturally closed,\nwithout invoking its closure. In this way we automatically reach the bipolar of\nthe set of deflators. We complete this picture by proving that the set of\nprocesses dominated by local martingale deflators is dense in our dual domain,\nconfirming that we have identified the natural dual space. In addition to the\noptimal consumption and deflator, we characterise the optimal wealth process.\nAt the optimum, deflated wealth is a supermartingale and a potential, while\ndeflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a uniformly integrable\nmartingale. This is the natural generalisation of the corresponding feature in\nthe terminal wealth problem, where deflated wealth at the optimum is a\nuniformly integrable martingale. We use no constructions involving equivalent\nlocal martingale measures. This is natural, given that such measures typically\ndo not exist over the infinite horizon and that we are working under NUPBR,\nwhich does not require their existence. The structure of the duality proof\nreveals an interesting feature compared with the terminal wealth problem.\nThere, the dual domain is $L^{1}$-bounded, but here the primal domain has this\nproperty, and hence many steps in the duality proof show a marked reversal of\nroles for the primal and dual domains, compared with the proofs of Kramkov and\nSchachermayer.\n",

The large fluctuations\nin the estimation of ES can be attenuated by the application of regularizers.\nIn this paper, we calculate ES analytically under an $\\ell_1$ regularizer by\nthe method of replicas borrowed from the statistical physics of random systems.\nThe ban on short selling, i.e. a constraint rendering all the portfolio weights\nnon-negative, is a special case of an asymmetric $\\ell_1$ regularizer.

It is partly because estimation of\neither covariance or precision matrix of asset returns tends to be unstable or\neven infeasible when the number of assets $p$ exceeds the number of\nobservations $n$. For this reason, most of the previous studies on portfolio\nmanagement have focused on the case of$ p < n$. To deal with the case of $p >\nn$, we propose to use a new Bayesian framework based on adaptive graphical\nLASSO for estimating the precision matrix of asset returns in a large-scale\nportfolio. Unlike the previous studies on graphical LASSO in the literature,\nour approach utilizes a Bayesian estimation method for the precision matrix\nproposed by Oya and Nakatsuma (2022) so that the positive definiteness of the\nprecision matrix should be always guaranteed. As an empirical application, we\nconstruct the global minimum variance portfolio of $p = 100$ for various values\nof n with the proposed approach as well as the non-Bayesian graphical LASSO\napproach, and compare their out-of-sample performance with the equal weight\nportfolio as the benchmark. In this comparison, the proposed approach produces\nmore stable results than the non-Bayesian approach in terms of Sharpe ratio,\nportfolio composition and turnover. Furthermore, the proposed approach succeeds\nin estimating the precision matrix even if $n$ is much smaller than $p$ and the\nnon-Bayesian approach fails to do so.\n",

In the case of linear taxes and a positive riskless interest\nrate, the problem is nontrivial because at the selling time the investor has to\nrealize book profits which triggers tax payments. We derive a boundary that is\ncontinuous and increasing in time and decreasing in the volatility of the stock\nsuch that the investor sells the stock at the first time its price is smaller\nor equal to this boundary.\n",

Although it requires only\none input, namely the covariance matrix of asset returns, estimating the\noptimal solution remains a challenge. In the presence of high-dimensionality in\nthe data, the sample covariance estimator becomes ill-conditioned and leads to\nsuboptimal portfolios out-of-sample. To address this issue, we review recently\nproposed efficient estimation methods for the covariance matrix and extend the\nliterature by suggesting a multi-fold cross-validation technique for selecting\nthe necessary tuning parameters within each method. Conducting an extensive\nempirical analysis with four datasets based on the S&P 500, we show that the\ndata-driven choice of specific tuning parameters with the proposed\ncross-validation improves the out-of-sample performance of the global\nminimum-variance portfolio. In addition, we identify estimators that are\nstrongly influenced by the choice of the tuning parameter and detect a clear\nrelationship between the selection criterion within the cross-validation and\nthe evaluated performance measure.\n",

Recently, robust\noptimization (RO) models have attracted a lot of interest in this area. RO\nprovides a computationally tractable framework for portfolio optimization based\non relatively general assumptions on the probability distributions of the\nuncertain risk parameters. Thus, RO extends the framework of traditional linear\nand non-linear models (e.g., the well-known mean-variance model), incorporating\nuncertainty through a formal and analytical approach into the modeling process.\nRobust counterparts of existing models can be considered as worst-case\nre-formulations as far as deviations of the uncertain parameters from their\nnominal values are concerned. Although several RO models have been proposed in\nthe literature focusing on various risk measures and different types of\nuncertainty sets about asset returns, analytical empirical assessments of their\nperformance have not been performed in a comprehensive manner. The objective of\nthis study is to fill in this gap in the literature. More specifically, we\nconsider different types of RO models based on popular risk measures and\nconduct an extensive comparative analysis of their performance using data from\nthe US market during the period 2005-2016.\n",

In particular, it is well known that the VaR portfolio problem can be\nformulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that is difficult to solve\nwith current MILP solvers for medium to large-scale instances of the problem.\nHere, we present an algorithm to compute near-optimal VaR portfolios that takes\nadvantage of this MILP formulation and provides a guarantee of the solution's\nnear-optimality.

We obtain closed formulas for the optimal\ninvestment strategy, the value function and the optimal terminal wealth. We\nfind the optimal strategy is independent of the development of the risky asset,\nand the solution converges to that of a continuous-time Heston stochastic\nvolatility model, albeit under additional conditions. For a daily trading\nscenario, the optimal solutions are quite robust to variations in the\nparameters, while the numerical wealth equivalent loss (WEL) analysis shows\ngood performance of the Heston solution, with a quite inferior performance of\nthe Merton solution.\n",

At the core of our design is an innovative permutation\ninvariant correlation processing layer. An extensive set of experiments are\nconducted using data from both Canadian (TSX) and American stock markets (S&P\n500), and WaveCorr consistently outperforms other architectures with an\nimpressive 3%-25% absolute improvement in terms of average annual return, and\nup to more than 200% relative improvement in average Sharpe ratio.

In this\npaper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents\nfor the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as\nthe reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing\nactual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a\nlinear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL\nagents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are\nthe coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model.\nThirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and\nmulti-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by\ncalculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent\nand the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods.\nFinally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent\nstocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021. Our approach empirically reveals that a\nDRL agent exhibits a stronger multi-step prediction power than machine learning\nmethods.\n",

We present a unified framework for incorporating numeric ESG\nratings into dynamic pricing theory. Specifically, we introduce an ESG-valued\nreturn that is a linearly constrained transformation of financial return and\nESG score. This leads to a more complex portfolio optimization problem in a\nspace governed by reward, risk and ESG score. The framework preserves the\ntraditional risk aversion parameter and introduces an ESG affinity parameter.\nWe apply this framework to develop ESG-valued: portfolio optimization; capital\nmarket line; risk measures; option pricing; and the computation of shadow\nriskless rates.\n",

Finally, these expectations are used\nas an input of the classical mean-variance optimization. Using data from\nEUROSTOXX 50 and S&P 100 we empirically compare the success of the two\napproaches in the context of portfolio performance analysis and observe that in\ngeneral aggregating orders by social choice methods outperforms robust\noptimization based methods for both data sets.\n",

The three\nkey points of our approach are: (a) apply the univariate time-varying\nvolatility model AdaVol, (b) obtain probabilistic forecasts of future returns,\nand (c) optimize the competition metrics using stochastic gradient-based\nalgorithms. We contend that the simplicity of our approach contributes to its\nrobustness and consistency. Remarkably, our performance in the M6 competition\nresulted in an overall 7th ranking, with a noteworthy 5th position in the\nforecasting task. This achievement, considering the perceived simplicity of our\napproach, underscores the efficacy of our adaptive volatility method in the\nrealm of probabilistic forecasting.\n",

        "summary": "  In financial engineering, portfolio optimization has been of consistent\ninterest. Portfolio optimization is a process of modulating asset distributions\nto maximize expected returns and minimize risks. To obtain the expected\nreturns, deep learning models have been explored in recent years. However, due\nto the deterministic nature of the models, it is difficult to consider the risk\nof portfolios because conventional deep learning models do not know how\nreliable their predictions can be. To address this limitation, this paper\nproposes a probabilistic model, namely predictive auxiliary classifier\ngenerative adversarial networks (PredACGAN). The proposed PredACGAN utilizes\nthe characteristic of the ACGAN framework in which the output of the generator\nforms a distribution. While ACGAN has not been employed for predictive models\nand is generally utilized for image sample generation, this paper proposes a\nmethod to use the ACGAN structure for a probabilistic and predictive model.\nAdditionally, an algorithm to use the risk measurement obtained by PredACGAN is\nproposed. In the algorithm, the assets that are predicted to be at high risk\nare eliminated from the investment universe at the rebalancing moment.\nTherefore, PredACGAN considers both return and risk to optimize portfolios. The\nproposed algorithm and PredACGAN have been evaluated with daily close price\ndata of S&P 500 from 1990 to 2020. Experimental scenarios are assumed to\nrebalance the portfolios monthly according to predictions and risk measures\nwith PredACGAN. As a result, a portfolio using PredACGAN exhibits 9.123% yearly\nreturns and a Sharpe ratio of 1.054, while a portfolio without considering risk\nmeasures shows 1.024% yearly returns and a Sharpe ratio of 0.236 in the same\nscenario. Also, the maximum drawdown of the proposed portfolio is lower than\nthe portfolio without PredACGAN.\n",

This equips them\nto navigate financial changes, formulate strategies, and debate with peer\nagents about investment decisions. Another standout feature of our approach is\nto equip agents with individualized trading traits, enhancing memory diversity\nand decision robustness.

This work illustrates three\napproaches to portfolio design minimizing the risk, optimizing the risk, and\nassigning equal weights to the stocks of a portfolio. Thirteen critical sectors\nlisted on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are first chosen. Three\nportfolios are designed following the above approaches choosing the top ten\nstocks from each sector based on their free-float market capitalization. The\nportfolios are designed using the historical prices of the stocks from Jan 1,\n2017, to Dec 31, 2022. The portfolios are evaluated on the stock price data\nfrom Jan 1, 2022, to Dec 31, 2022.

Following the seminal work of\nMarkowitz, optimal asset allocation can be computed using a constrained\noptimization model based on empirical covariance. However, covariance is\ntypically estimated from historical lookback observations, and it is prone to\nnoise and may inadequately represent future market behavior. As a remedy,\ninformation filtering networks from network science can be used to mitigate the\nnoise in empirical covariance estimation, and therefore, can bring added value\nto the portfolio construction process. In this paper, we propose the use of the\nStatistically Robust Information Filtering Network (SR-IFN) which leverages the\nbootstrapping techniques to eliminate unnecessary edges during the network\nformation and enhances the network's noise reduction capability further. We\napply SR-IFN to index component stock pools in the US, UK, and China to assess\nits effectiveness. The SR-IFN network is partially disconnected with isolated\nnodes representing lesser-correlated assets, facilitating the selection of\nperipheral, diversified and higher-performing portfolios. Further optimization\nof performance can be achieved by inversely proportioning asset weights to\ntheir centrality based on the resultant network.\n",

        "summary": "  This article investigates a regime-switching investment strategy aimed at\nmitigating downside risk by reducing market exposure during anticipated\nunfavorable market regimes. We highlight the statistical jump model (JM) for\nmarket regime identification, a recently developed robust model that\ndistinguishes itself from traditional Markov-switching models by enhancing\nregime persistence through a jump penalty applied at each state transition. Our\nJM utilizes a feature set comprising risk and return measures derived solely\nfrom the return series, with the optimal jump penalty selected through a\ntime-series cross-validation method that directly optimizes strategy\nperformance. Our empirical analysis evaluates the realistic out-of-sample\nperformance of various strategies on major equity indices from the US, Germany,\nand Japan from 1990 to 2023, in the presence of transaction costs and trading\ndelays. The results demonstrate the consistent outperformance of the JM-guided\nstrategy in reducing risk metrics such as volatility and maximum drawdown, and\nenhancing risk-adjusted returns like the Sharpe ratio, when compared to both\nhidden Markov model-guided strategy and the buy-and-hold strategy. These\nfindings underline the enhanced persistence, practicality, and versatility of\nstrategies utilizing JMs for regime-switching signals.\n",

In\nrecent years, DRL algorithms have been widely applied by scholars for portfolio\noptimization in consecutive trading periods, since the DRL agent can\ndynamically adapt to market changes and does not rely on the specification of\nthe joint dynamics across the assets. However, typical DRL agents for portfolio\noptimization cannot learn a policy that is aware of the dynamic correlation\nbetween portfolio asset returns. Since the dynamic correlations among portfolio\nassets are crucial in optimizing the portfolio, the lack of such knowledge\nmakes it difficult for the DRL agent to maximize the return per unit of risk,\nespecially when the target market permits short selling (i.e., the US stock\nmarket). In this research, we propose a hybrid portfolio optimization model\ncombining the DRL agent and the Black-Litterman (BL) model to enable the DRL\nagent to learn the dynamic correlation between the portfolio asset returns and\nimplement an efficacious long/short strategy based on the correlation.\nEssentially, the DRL agent is trained to learn the policy to apply the BL model\nto determine the target portfolio weights. To test our DRL agent, we construct\nthe portfolio based on all the Dow Jones Industrial Average constitute stocks.\nEmpirical results of the experiments conducted on real-world United States\nstock market data demonstrate that our DRL agent significantly outperforms\nvarious comparison portfolio choice strategies and alternative DRL frameworks\nby at least 42% in terms of accumulated return. In terms of the return per unit\nof risk, our DRL agent significantly outperforms various comparative portfolio\nchoice strategies and alternative strategies based on other machine learning\nframeworks.\n",

Deriving online algorithms for optimizing\nthe SR is particularly challenging since even offline policies experience\nconstant regret with respect to the best expert Even-Dar et al (2006). Thus,\ninstead of optimizing the usual definition of SR, we optimize regularized\nsquare SR (RSSR). We consider two settings for the RSSR, Regret Minimization\n(RM) and Best Arm Identification (BAI). In this regard, we propose a novel\nmulti-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm for RM called UCB-RSSR for RSSR\nmaximization. We derive a path-dependent concentration bound for the estimate\nof the RSSR. Based on that, we derive the regret guarantees of UCB-RSSR and\nshow that it evolves as O(log n) for the two-armed bandit case played for a\nhorizon n. We also consider a fixed budget setting for well-known BAI\nalgorithms, i.e., sequential halving and successive rejects, and propose SHVV,\nSHSR, and SuRSR algorithms. We derive the upper bound for the error probability\nof all proposed BAI algorithms. We demonstrate that UCB-RSSR outperforms the\nonly other known SR optimizing bandit algorithm, U-UCB Cassel et al (2023). We\nalso establish its efficacy with respect to other benchmarks derived from the\nGRA-UCB and MVTS algorithms.

Specifically,\nparticipating teams were asked to implement, in Python, the basic functions of\nan Automated Market Maker and a liquidity provision strategy in an Automated\nMarket Maker to minimize the Conditional Value at Risk, a critical measure of\ninvestment risk. As the competition's winning team, we highlight our approach\nin this work. In particular, as the dependence of the final return on the\ninitial wealth distribution is highly non-linear, we cannot use standard ad-hoc\napproaches. Additionally, classical minimization techniques would require a\nsignificant computational load due to the cost of the target function. For\nthese reasons, we propose a three-step approach. In the first step, the target\nfunction is approximated by a Kernel Ridge Regression. Then, the approximating\nfunction is minimized. In the final step, the previously discovered minimum is\nutilized as the starting point for directly optimizing the desired target\nfunction. By using this procedure, we can both reduce the computational\ncomplexity and increase the accuracy of the solution.

One particular challenge\nis converting optimal portfolio weights into real-life trades in the presence\nof realistic features, such as transaction costs and integral lots. This is\nespecially important in automated trading, where the entire process happens\nwithout human intervention.\n  Several works in literature have extended portfolio optimisation models to\naccount for these features. In this paper, we highlight and illustrate\ndifficulties faced when employing the existing literature in a practical\nsetting, such as computational intractability, numerical imprecision and\nmodelling trade-offs. We then propose a two-stage framework as an alternative\napproach to address this issue. Its goal is to optimise portfolio weights in\nthe first stage and to generate realistic trades in the second. Through\nextensive computational experiments, we show that our approach not only\nmitigates the difficulties discussed above but also can be successfully\nemployed in a realistic scenario.\n  By splitting the problem in two, we are able to incorporate new features\nwithout adding too much complexity to any single model. With this in mind we\nmodel two novel features that are critical to many investment strategies:\nfirst, we integrate two classes of assets, futures contracts and equities, into\na single framework, with an example illustrating how this can help portfolio\nmanagers in enhancing investment strategies. Second, we account for borrowing\ncosts in short positions, which have so far been neglected in literature but\nwhich significantly impact profits in long/short strategies.

        "summary": "  Markowitz laid the foundation of portfolio theory through the mean-variance\noptimization (MVO) framework. However, the effectiveness of MVO is contingent\non the precise estimation of expected returns, variances, and covariances of\nasset returns, which are typically uncertain. Machine learning models are\nbecoming useful in estimating uncertain parameters, and such models are trained\nto minimize prediction errors, such as mean squared errors (MSE), which treat\nprediction errors uniformly across assets. Recent studies have pointed out that\nthis approach would lead to suboptimal decisions and proposed Decision-Focused\nLearning (DFL) as a solution, integrating prediction and optimization to\nimprove decision-making outcomes. While studies have shown DFL's potential to\nenhance portfolio performance, the detailed mechanisms of how DFL modifies\nprediction models for MVO remain unexplored. This study aims to investigate how\nDFL adjusts stock return prediction models to optimize decisions in MVO,\naddressing the question: \"MSE treats the errors of all assets equally, but how\ndoes DFL reduce errors of different assets differently?\" Answering this will\nprovide crucial insights into optimal stock return prediction for constructing\nefficient portfolios.\n",

What\nmakes the model special is that the agent is allowed to purchase costly expert\nopinions of varying quality on the current state of the drift, leading to a\nmixed stochastic control problem with regular and impulse controls involving\nrandom consequences. Using ideas from filtering theory, we first embed the\noriginal problem with unobservable drift into a full information problem on a\nlarger state space. The value function of the full information problem is\ncharacterized as the unique viscosity solution of the dynamic programming PDE.\nThis characterization is achieved by a new variant of the stochastic Perron's\nmethod, which additionally allows us to show that, in between purchases of\nexpert opinions, the problem reduces to an exit time control problem which is\nknown to admit an optimal feedback control. Under the assumption of sufficient\nregularity of this feedback map, we are able to construct optimal trading and\nexpert opinion strategies.\n",

This approach extends the well-regarded\nPrincipal Orthogonal Complement Thresholding (POET) method (Fan et al., 2013),\nenabling it to effectively handle heavy tails and sudden shocks in data. The\nnovelty of the proposed robust method is its adaptiveness to both global and\nidiosyncratic shocks, without the need to distinguish them, which is useful in\nforming portfolio weights when facing outliers.

A\nsearch using Google and existing IPO lists identified eligible companies.

Key performance indicators, including\nCompound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), relative performance to benchmark indices,\nand market capitalization change, were compared using Mann-Whitney U and\nFisher's Exact tests.\n  Results: Of the 33 companies analyzed, 15 (45.5%) had billing codes at IPO.\nThe median IPO price was $17.00, with no significant difference between groups.\nThose with billing codes were 25.5 times more likely to achieve a positive\nCAGR.

The price is either directly adopted from the real\nstock market indices or generated with a Markov chain of order $\\le 2$.

Here we empirically compare the performance of 9 improved\ncovariance estimation procedures by using daily returns of 90 highly\ncapitalized US stocks for the period 1997-2007. We find that the usefulness of\ncovariance matrix estimators strongly depends on the ratio between estimation\nperiod T and number of stocks N, on the presence or absence of short selling,\nand on the performance metric considered. When short selling is allowed,\nseveral estimation methods achieve a realized risk that is significantly\nsmaller than the one obtained with the sample covariance method. This is\nparticularly true when T/N is close to one. Moreover many estimators reduce the\nfraction of negative portfolio weights, while little improvement is achieved in\nthe degree of diversification. On the contrary when short selling is not\nallowed and T>N, the considered methods are unable to outperform the sample\ncovariance in terms of realized risk but can give much more diversified\nportfolios than the one obtained with the sample covariance. When T<N the use\nof the sample covariance matrix and of the pseudoinverse gives portfolios with\nvery poor performance.\n",

Then\ntwo benchmark data sets (Fama and French 48 industries and 100 size and BM\nratio portfolios) are used to examine performances of the sparse portfolios.\nWhen the sample size is not relatively large to the number of assets, sparse\nportfolios tend to have lower out-of-sample portfolio variances, turnover\nrates, active assets, short-sale positions, but higher Sharpe ratios than the\nunregularised MVP. We then show some possible extensions; particularly we\nderive an efficient algorithm for solving an MVP problem in which assets are\nallowed to be chosen grouply.\n",

The paper specifies and tests a multi-factor housing\nasset pricing model. In that model, we evaluate whether the market factor as\nwell as other measures of risk, including idiosyncratic risk, momentum, and MSA\nsize effects, have explanatory power for metropolitan-specific housing returns.\nFurther, we test the robustness of the asset pricing results to inclusion of\ncontrols for socioeconomic variables commonly represented in the house price\nliterature, including changes in employment, affordability, and foreclosure\nincidence. We find a sizable and statistically significant influence of the\nmarket factor on MSA house price returns. Moreover we show that market betas\nhave varied substantially over time. Also, results are largely robust to the\ninclusion of other explanatory variables, including standard measures of risk\nand other housing market fundamentals. Additional tests of model validity using\nthe Fama-MacBeth framework offer further strong support of a positive risk and\nreturn relationship in housing. Our findings are supportive of the application\nof a housing investment risk-return framework in explanation of variation in\nmetro-area cross-section and time-series US house price returns.

We prove that the optimal portfolio\nweights depend on the covariance matrices of the next two periods and the\nconditional mean vector of the next period.

It is compared with the investment strategy obtained under\nthe additional assumption that the asset returns are independently distributed.\n",

When the agent chooses volatility components of the\noutput process and the principal observes the output continuously, the\nprincipal can compute the quadratic variation of the output, but not the\nindividual components. This leads to moral hazard with respect to the risk\nchoices of the agent. We identify a family of admissible contracts for which\nthe optimal agent's action is explicitly characterized, and, using the recent\ntheory of singular changes of measures for It\\^o processes, we study how\nrestrictive this family is. In particular, in the special case of the standard\nHomlstr\\\"om-Milgrom model with fixed volatility, the family includes all\npossible contracts. We solve the principal-agent problem in the case of CARA\npreferences, and show that the optimal contract is linear in these factors: the\ncontractible sources of risk, including the output, the quadratic variation of\nthe output and the cross-variations between the output and the contractible\nrisk sources. Thus, like sample Sharpe ratios used in practice, path-dependent\ncontracts naturally arise when there is moral hazard with respect to risk\nmanagement. In a numerical example, we show that the loss of efficiency can be\nsignificant if the principal does not use the quadratic variation component of\nthe optimal contract.\n",

As important properties, the EVaR is strongly monotone over its domain\nand strictly monotone over a broad sub-domain including all continuous\ndistributions, while well-known monotone risk measures, such as VaR and CVaR\nlack these properties. A key feature for a risk measure, besides its financial\nproperties, is its applicability in large-scale sample-based portfolio\noptimization. If the negative return of an investment portfolio is a\ndifferentiable convex function, the portfolio optimization with the EVaR\nresults in a differentiable convex program whose number of variables and\nconstraints is independent of the sample size, which is not the case for the\nVaR and CVaR. This enables us to design an efficient algorithm using\ndifferentiable convex optimization. Our extensive numerical study shows the\nhigh efficiency of the algorithm in large scales, compared to the existing\nconvex optimization software packages. The computational efficiency of the EVaR\nportfolio optimization approach is also compared with that of CVaR-based\nportfolio optimization.

Moreover,\nthe comparison of the portfolios obtained for a real case by the EVaR and CVaR\napproaches shows that the EVaR approach can find portfolios with better\nexpectations and VaR values at high confidence levels.\n",

The investment decision of\ninvestors, derived through an optimization, drives the stock price. The model\nhas been inspired by the econophysical Levy-Levy-Solomon model (Economics\nLetters, 45). The goal of this work is to gain insights into the stock price\nand wealth distribution. We especially want to discover the causes for the\nappearance of power-laws in financial data. We follow a kinetic approach\nsimilar to (D. Maldarella, L. Pareschi, Physica A, 391) and derive the mean\nfield limit of our microscopic agent dynamics. The novelty in our approach is\nthat the financial agents apply model predictive control (MPC) to approximate\nand solve the optimization of their utility function. Interestingly, the MPC\napproach gives a mathematical connection between the two opponent economic\nconcepts of modeling financial agents to be rational or boundedly rational.\nFurthermore, this is to our knowledge the first kinetic portfolio model which\nconsiders a wealth and stock price distribution simultaneously. Due to our\nkinetic approach, we can study the wealth and price distribution on a\nmesoscopic level. The wealth distribution is characterized by a lognormal law.\nFor the stock price distribution, we can either observe a lognormal behavior in\nthe case of long-term investors or a power-law in the case of high-frequency\ntrader. Furthermore, the stock return data exhibits a fat-tail, which is a well\nknown characteristic of real financial data.\n",

To address\nthis, we consider the seminal approach of G\\\"orgen \\textsl{et al.} (2019), who\nproposed estimating the carbon financial risk of equities by their carbon beta.\nTo achieve this, the primary task is to develop a brown-minus-green (or BMG)\nrisk factor, similar to Fama and French (1992). Secondly, we must estimate the\ncarbon beta using a multi-factor model. While G\\\"orgen \\textsl{et al.} (2019)\nconsidered that the carbon beta is constant, we propose a time-varying\nestimation model to assess the dynamics of the carbon risk. Moreover, we test\nseveral specifications of the BMG factor to understand which climate\nchange-related dimensions are priced in by the stock market. In the second part\nof the article, we focus on the carbon risk management of investment\nportfolios. First, we analyze how carbon risk impacts the construction of a\nminimum variance portfolio. As the goal of this portfolio is to reduce\nunrewarded financial risks of an investment, incorporating the carbon risk into\nthis approach fulfils this objective. Second, we propose a new framework for\nbuilding enhanced index portfolios with a lower exposure to carbon risk than\ncapitalization-weighted stock indices.

In this paper,\nwe propose SARL, a novel State-Augmented RL framework for PM.

To incorporate heterogeneous\ndata and enhance robustness against environment uncertainty, our SARL augments\nthe asset information with their price movement prediction as additional\nstates, where the prediction can be solely based on financial data (e.g., asset\nprices) or derived from alternative sources such as news. Experiments on two\nreal-world datasets, (i) Bitcoin market and (ii) HighTech stock market with\n7-year Reuters news articles, validate the effectiveness of SARL over existing\nPM approaches, both in terms of accumulated profits and risk-adjusted profits.\nMoreover, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the importance of\nour proposed state augmentation, providing new insights and boosting\nperformance significantly over standard RL-based PM method and other baselines.\n",

In this setting, there is a large body of literature which\nincludes arguments that the theory often leads to bets which are \"too\naggressive\" with respect to various risk metrics. To remedy this problem, many\npapers include prescriptions for scaling down the bet size. Such schemes are\nreferred to as Fractional Kelly Betting. In this paper, we take the opposite\ntack. That is, we show that in many cases, the theoretical Kelly-based results\nmay lead to bets which are \"too conservative\" rather than too aggressive. To\nmake this argument, we consider a random vector X with its assumed probability\ndistribution and draw m samples to obtain an empirically-derived counterpart\nXhat. Subsequently, we derive and compare the resulting Kelly bets for both X\nand Xhat with consideration of sample size m as part of the analysis. This\nleads to identification of many cases which have the following salient feature:\nThe resulting bet size using the true theoretical distribution for X is much\nsmaller than that for Xhat. If instead the bet is based on empirical data,\n\"golden\" opportunities are identified which are essentially rejected when the\npurely theoretical model is used. To formalize these ideas, we provide a result\nwhich we call the Restricted Betting Theorem. An extreme case of the theorem is\nobtained when X has unbounded support. In this situation, using X, the Kelly\ntheory can lead to no betting at all.\n",

It is based on a novel concept called portfolio dimensionality\nthat connects diversification to the non-Gaussianity of portfolio returns and\ncan typically be defined in terms of the ratio of risk measures which are\nhomogenous functions of equal degree. The latter arises naturally due to our\nrequirement that diversification measures should be leverage invariant. We\nintroduce this new framework and argue the benefits relative to existing\nmeasures of diversification in the literature, before addressing the question\nof optimizing diversification or, equivalently, dimensionality. Maximising\nportfolio dimensionality leads to highly non-trivial optimization problems with\nobjective functions which are typically non-convex and potentially have\nmultiple local optima. Two complementary global optimization algorithms are\nthus presented. For problems of moderate size and more akin to asset allocation\nproblems, a deterministic Branch and Bound algorithm is developed, whereas for\nproblems of larger size a stochastic global optimization algorithm based on\nGradient Langevin Dynamics is given.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is also used to implement feature\nselection. The effectiveness of the stock selection strategy is validated in\nChinese stock market in both statistical and practical aspects, showing that:\n1) Stacking outperforms other models reaching an AUC score of 0.972; 2) Genetic\nAlgorithm picks a subset of 114 features and the prediction performances of all\nmodels remain almost unchanged after the selection procedure, which suggests\nsome features are indeed redundant; 3) LR and DNN are radical models; RF is\nrisk-neutral model; Stacking is somewhere between DNN and RF. 4) The portfolios\nconstructed by our models outperform market average in back tests.\n",

In order to attain certain desired return\nprofiles, quantitative strategists must determine a large array of trading\nparameters. Backtesting, the attempt to identify the appropriate parameters\nusing historical data available, has been highly criticized due to the\nabundance of misleading results. Hence, there is an increasing interest in\ndevising procedures for the assessment and comparison of strategies, that is,\ndevising schemes for preventing what is known as backtesting overfitting. So\nfar, many financial researchers have proposed different ways to tackle this\nproblem that can be broadly categorised in three types: Data Snooping,\nOverestimated Performance, and Cross-Validation Evaluation. In this paper, we\npropose a new approach to dealing with financial overfitting, a\nCovariance-Penalty Correction, in which a risk metric is lowered given the\nnumber of parameters and data used to underpins a trading strategy. We outlined\nthe foundation and main results behind the Covariance-Penalty correction for\ntrading strategies. After that, we pursue an empirical investigation, comparing\nits performance with some other approaches in the realm of Covariance-Penalties\nacross more than 1300 assets, using Ordinary and Total Least Squares. Our\nresults suggest that Covariance-Penalties are a suitable procedure to avoid\nBacktesting Overfitting, and Total Least Squares provides superior performance\nwhen compared to Ordinary Least Squares.\n",

It is assumed that the fund\nmanager can dynamically inject capital into the portfolio account such that the\ntotal capital dominates a non-decreasing benchmark floor process at each\nintermediate time. The tracking problem is formulated to minimize the cost of\naccumulated capital injection. We first transform the original problem with\nfloor constraints into an unconstrained control problem, however, under a\nrunning maximum cost. By identifying a controlled state process with\nreflection, the problem is further shown to be equivalent to an auxiliary\nproblem, which leads to a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with\na Neumann boundary condition. By employing the dual transform, the\nprobabilistic representation and some stochastic flow analysis, the existence\nof the unique classical solution to the HJB equation is established. The\nverification theorem is carefully proved, which gives the complete\ncharacterization of the feedback optimal portfolio. The application to market\nindex tracking is also discussed when the index process is modeled by a\ngeometric Brownian motion.\n",

Based on this viewpoint, we survey certain\nstate-of-the-art tools from geometric and statistical computing in order to\nhandle important and difficult problems in digital finance. Although our tools\nare quite general, in this paper we focus on two specific questions.\n  The first concerns crisis detection, which is of prime interest for the\npublic in general and for policy makers in particular because of the\nsignificant impact that crises have on the economy. Certain features in stock\nmarkets lead to this type of anomaly detection: Given the assets' returns, we\ndescribe the relationship between portfolios' return and volatility by means of\na copula, without making any assumption on investor strategies. We examine a\nrecent method relying on copulae to construct an appropriate indicator that\nallows us to automate crisis detection. On real data, the indicator detects all\npast crashes in the cryptocurrency market, whereas from the DJ600-Europe index,\nfrom 1990 to 2008, the indicator identifies correctly 4 crises and issues one\nfalse positive for which we offer an explanation.\n  Our second contribution is to introduce an original computational framework\nto model asset allocation strategies, which is of independent interest for\ndigital finance and its applications. Our approach addresses the crucial\nquestion of evaluating portfolio management, and is relevant to individual\nmanagers as well as financial institutions. To evaluate portfolio performance,\nwe provide a new portfolio score, based on the aforementioned framework and\nconcepts. In particular, our score relies on the statistical properties of\nportfolios, and we show how they can be computed efficiently.\n",

The present\npaper extends the analysis to a more general setting by assuming that the two\nrisk measures are only quasiconvex. First, we study the case where the\nprincipal risk measure is convex. We introduce a dual problem, show that there\nis zero duality gap between the portfolio optimization problem and the dual\nproblem, and finally identify a condition under which the Lagrange multiplier\nassociated to the dual problem at optimality gives an optimal portfolio.

In particular, we consider income, consumption and risky investment\nin the stochastic framework, extending previous results in\n\\cite{Bayraktar2016}. The time cutoff m and n make the work more difficult.\nHowever, by establishing new controls,``\\emph{quasi-ideal value}\"\nand``\\emph{ideal value}\", we solve the corresponding ordinary differential\nequations or stochastic differential equations, and give the specific\nexpressions for the maximum probability. Then we provide the optimal life\ninsurance purchasing strategies and the optimal risk investment strategies.

We develop a continuous time framework for\ntaking into account ambiguity aversion about both expected return rates and\ncorrelation matrix of the assets, and for studying the join effects on\nportfolio diversification. The dynamic setting allows us to consider time\nvarying ambiguity sets, which include the cases where the drift and correlation\nare estimated on a rolling window of historical data or when the investor takes\ninto account learning on the ambiguity. In this context, we prove a general\nseparation principle for the associated robust control problem, which allows us\nto reduce the determination of the optimal dynamic strategy to the parametric\ncomputation of the minimal risk premium function. Our results provide a\njustification for under-diversification, as documented in empirical studies and\nin the static models [16], [34]. Furthermore, we explicitly quantify the degree\nof under-diversification in termsof correlation bounds and Sharpe ratios\nproximities, and emphasize the different features induced by drift and\ncorrelation ambiguity. In particular, we show that an investor with a poor\nconfidence in the expected return estimation does not hold any risky asset, and\non the other hand, trades only one risky asset when the level of ambiguity on\ncorrelation matrix is large.

Experimentally, we chose five\nlowrelevant American stocks to test the model. The result demonstrates that the\nDQN based strategy outperforms the ten other traditional strategies. The profit\nof DQN algorithm is 30% more than the profit of other strategies.

Although MPT has\nmade huge impacts on the investment world and prompted the success and\nprevalence of passive investing, it still has shortcomings in real-world\napplications. One of the main challenges is that the level of risk an investor\ncan endure, known as \\emph{risk-preference}, is a subjective choice that is\ntightly related to psychology and behavioral science in decision making. This\npaper presents a novel approach of measuring risk preference from existing\nportfolios using inverse optimization on the mean-variance portfolio allocation\nframework. Our approach allows the learner to continuously estimate real-time\nrisk preferences using concurrent observed portfolios and market price data. We\ndemonstrate our methods on real market data that consists of 20 years of asset\npricing and 10 years of mutual fund portfolio holdings. Moreover, the\nquantified risk preference parameters are validated with two well-known risk\nmeasurements currently applied in the field. The proposed methods could lead to\npractical and fruitful innovations in automated/personalized portfolio\nmanagement, such as Robo-advising, to augment financial advisors' decision\nintelligence in a long-term investment horizon.\n",

While this\nranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting the\noutputs produced by pointwise regression or classification techniques,\nstrategies using Learning to Rank algorithms have recently presented themselves\nas competitive and viable alternatives. Although the rankers at the core of\nthese strategies are learned globally and improve ranking accuracy on average,\nthey ignore the differences between the distributions of asset features over\nthe times when the portfolio is rebalanced. This flaw renders them susceptible\nto producing sub-optimal rankings, possibly at important periods when accuracy\nis actually needed the most. For example, this might happen during critical\nrisk-off episodes, which consequently exposes the portfolio to substantial,\nunwanted drawdowns. We tackle this shortcoming with an analogous idea from\ninformation retrieval: that a query's top retrieved documents or the local\nranking context provide vital information about the query's own\ncharacteristics, which can then be used to refine the initial ranked list. In\nthis work, we use a context-aware Learning-to-rank model that is based on the\nTransformer architecture to encode top/bottom ranked assets, learn the context\nand exploit this information to re-rank the initial results. Backtesting on a\nslate of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology increases the Sharpe ratio by\naround 30% and significantly enhances various performance metrics.\nAdditionally, this approach also improves the Sharpe ratio when separately\nconditioning on normal and risk-off market states.\n",

However, traditional stochastic\ncontrol techniques are not applicable in this scenario, and additional\nassumptions are required to obtain the optimal solution in a before-and-after\ndefault context. We propose an alternative approach using forward integration,\nwhich allows to avoid one of the restrictive assumptions, the Jacod density\nhypothesis. We demonstrate that, in the case of logarithmic utility, the weaker\nintensity hypothesis is the appropriate condition for optimality. Furthermore,\nwe establish the semimartingale decomposition of the risky asset in the\nfiltration that is progressively enlarged to accommodate the default process,\nunder the assumption of the existence of the optimal portfolio. This work aims\nto provide valueable insights for developing effective risk management\nstrategies when facing default risk.\n",

An index fund is a\nmutual fund aiming to track the returns of a predefined market index (e.g., the\nS&P 500). A basic strategy to manage an index fund is replicating the index's\nconstituents and weights identically, which is, however, cost-ineffective and\nimpractical. To address this issue, it is required to replicate the index\npartially with accurately predicted market sensitivities. Accordingly, we\npropose a novel partial-replication method via learning to predict market\nsensitivities. We first examine deep-learning models to predict market\nsensitivities in a supervised manner with our data-processing methods. Then, we\npropose a partial-index-tracking optimization model controlling the net\npredicted market sensitivities of the portfolios and index to be the same.\nThese processes' efficacy is corroborated by our experiments on the Korea Stock\nPrice Index 200. Our experiments show a significant reduction of the prediction\nerrors compared with historical estimations and competitive tracking errors of\nreplicating the index utilizing fewer than half of the entire constituents.\nTherefore, we show that applying deep learning to predict market sensitivities\nis promising and that our portfolio construction methods are practically\neffective. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first study addressing\nmarket sensitivities focused on deep learning.\n",

In particular, the correct prediction of this variability ensures\ninvestors successful investments. However, there has been a big trend in\nfinance in the last years, which are the ESG criteria. Concretely, ESG\n(Economic, Social and Governance) criteria have become more significant in\nfinance due to the growing importance of investments being socially\nresponsible, and because of the financial impact companies suffer when not\ncomplying with them. Consequently, creating a stock portfolio should not only\ntake into account its performance but compliance with ESG criteria. Hence, this\npaper combines mathematical modelling, with ESG and finance. In more detail, we\nuse Bayesian optimization (BO), a sequential state-of-the-art design strategy\nto optimize black-boxes with unknown analytical and costly-to compute\nexpressions, to maximize the performance of a stock portfolio under the\npresence of ESG criteria soft constraints incorporated to the objective\nfunction. In an illustrative experiment, we use the Sharpe ratio, that takes\ninto consideration the portfolio returns and its variance, in other words, it\nbalances the trade-off between maximizing returns and minimizing risks. In the\npresent work, ESG criteria have been divided into fourteen independent\ncategories used in a linear combination to estimate a firm total ESG score.\nMost importantly, our presented approach would scale to alternative black-box\nmethods of estimating the performance and ESG compliance of the stock\nportfolio.

Additionally, two\nadaptive mechanisms are provided to dynamically adjust the impact of risk\ncontrollers such that the proposed framework can be flexibly adapted to uptrend\nand downtrend markets. The empirical results of our proposed framework clearly\nreveal such advantages against most well-known RL-based approaches on\nreal-world data sets.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown its\npotential to train profitable agents for PM through interacting with financial\nmarkets. However, existing work mostly focuses on fixed stock pools, which is\ninconsistent with investors' practical demand. Specifically, the target stock\npool of different investors varies dramatically due to their discrepancy on\nmarket states and individual investors may temporally adjust stocks they desire\nto trade (e.g., adding one popular stocks), which lead to customizable stock\npools (CSPs). Existing RL methods require to retrain RL agents even with a tiny\nchange of the stock pool, which leads to high computational cost and unstable\nperformance. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarnMore, a rEinforcement\nleARNing framework with Maskable stOck REpresentation to handle PM with CSPs\nthrough one-shot training in a global stock pool (GSP). Specifically, we first\nintroduce a mechanism to mask out the representation of the stocks outside the\ntarget pool.

RVRAE ingeniously combines the\nprinciples of dynamic factor modeling with the variational recurrent\nautoencoder (VRAE) from deep learning. A key feature of RVRAE is its use of a\nprior-posterior learning method. This method fine-tunes the model's learning\nprocess by seeking an optimal posterior factor model informed by future data.\nNotably, RVRAE is adept at risk modeling in volatile stock markets, estimating\nvariances from latent space distributions while also predicting returns.

Yet in most cases, the existing\napproaches may produce biased trading signals based on the conventional price\ndata due to a lot of market noises, which possibly fails to balance the\ninvestment returns and risks. Accordingly, a multi-agent and self-adaptive\nportfolio optimisation framework integrated with attention mechanisms and time\nseries, namely the MASAAT, is proposed in this work in which multiple trading\nagents are created to observe and analyse the price series and directional\nchange data that recognises the significant changes of asset prices at\ndifferent levels of granularity for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of\nprice series. Afterwards, by reconstructing the tokens of financial data in a\nsequence, the attention-based cross-sectional analysis module and temporal\nanalysis module of each agent can effectively capture the correlations between\nassets and the dependencies between time points. Besides, a portfolio generator\nis integrated into the proposed framework to fuse the spatial-temporal\ninformation and then summarise the portfolios suggested by all trading agents\nto produce a newly ensemble portfolio for reducing biased trading actions and\nbalancing the overall returns and risks. The experimental results clearly\ndemonstrate that the MASAAT framework achieves impressive enhancement when\ncompared with many well-known portfolio optimsation approaches on three\nchallenging data sets of DJIA, S&P 500 and CSI 300.

As model complexity becomes sufficiently\nhigh, the performance improves with complexity again, resulting in a double\nascent Sharpe ratio curve similar to the double descent phenomenon observed in\nartificial intelligence. The underlying mechanisms involve an intricate\ninteraction between the theoretical Sharpe ratio and estimation accuracy. In\nhigh-dimensional models, the theoretical Sharpe ratio approaches its upper\nlimit, and the overfitting problem is reduced because there are more parameters\nthan data restrictions, which allows us to choose well-behaved parameters based\non inductive bias.\n",

Specifically, in the return-related maximization phase, we\nintroduce two auxiliary objectives, i.e., return rate prediction, and return\nrate ranking, combined with portfolio optimization to remit the overfitting\nproblem and improve the generalization of the trained model to future markets.\nSubsequently, in the risk control phase, we propose two methods, i.e.,\nportfolio interpolation and portfolio improvement, to achieve fine-grained risk\ncontrol and fast risk adaption to a user-specified risk level. For the\nportfolio interpolation method, we theoretically prove that the risk can be\nperfectly controlled if the to-be-set risk level is in a proper interval. In\naddition, we also show that the return rate of the adjusted portfolio after\nportfolio interpolation is no less than that of the min-variance optimization,\nas long as the model in the reward maximization phase is effective.\nFurthermore, the portfolio improvement method can achieve greater return rates\nwhile keeping the same risk level compared to portfolio interpolation.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets.

However, the adoption of these models\nin financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably\ndue to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper\naims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative\nmodels, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by\npresenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and\npoint out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally\navailable. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and\nthe desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models\ninherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in\nparticular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline\nfor the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation\nstandards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with\nstylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we\npreviously identified.

        "summary": "  We provide a new theory for nodewise regression when the residuals from a\nfitted factor model are used. We apply our results to the analysis of the\nconsistency of Sharpe ratio estimators when there are many assets in a\nportfolio. We allow for an increasing number of assets as well as time\nobservations of the portfolio. Since the nodewise regression is not feasible\ndue to the unknown nature of idiosyncratic errors, we provide a\nfeasible-residual-based nodewise regression to estimate the precision matrix of\nerrors which is consistent even when number of assets, p, exceeds the time span\nof the portfolio, n. In another new development, we also show that the\nprecision matrix of returns can be estimated consistently, even with an\nincreasing number of factors and p>n. We show that: (1) with p>n, the Sharpe\nratio estimators are consistent in global minimum-variance and mean-variance\nportfolios; and (2) with p>n, the maximum Sharpe ratio estimator is consistent\nwhen the portfolio weights sum to one; and (3) with p<<n, the\nmaximum-out-of-sample Sharpe ratio estimator is consistent.\n",

        "summary": "  Optimal asset allocation is a key topic in modern finance theory. To realize\nthe optimal asset allocation on investor's risk aversion, various portfolio\nconstruction methods have been proposed. Recently, the applications of machine\nlearning are rapidly growing in the area of finance. In this article, we\npropose the Student's $t$-process latent variable model (TPLVM) to describe\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations of financial timeseries by lower dimensional latent\nvariables. Subsequently, we apply the TPLVM to minimum-variance portfolio as an\nalternative of existing nonlinear factor models. To test the performance of the\nproposed portfolio, we construct minimum-variance portfolios of global stock\nmarket indices based on the TPLVM or Gaussian process latent variable model. By\ncomparing these portfolios, we confirm the proposed portfolio outperforms that\nof the existing Gaussian process latent variable model.\n",
